# The types of contracts possible

There are *many* types of contracts, proportional to how much we're connected with others in [society](jobs-specialization.md), and any given document may include multiple contracts inside it.

Formalized arrangements are the foundation of most business, and they're all connected through these contracts. For this reason, there are *many* domains of law that intersect and converge with contract law:

- Trust and inheritance law - for [death and succession planning](hardship-death.md)
- Property law - for high-value properties like [real estate](home-maintenance.md)
- Intellectual property law - for [intellectual property](legal-ip.md) ownership and enforcement
- Commercial/trade law - for [large-scale](groups-large.md) law matters such as corporations across multiple nations
- Competition law - for preserving [free market competition](economics.md)
- Insurance law - for protecting against losses in the course of contractual agreements

Generally, contracts are either payment (trading a good for another good or a service) or reciprocal (where both sides must perform).
