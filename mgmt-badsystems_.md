All political, social, and interpersonal systems convey and reinforce the [appearance](image.md) of accomplishing a good [purpose](purpose.md).

Bad systems are rarely created [maliciously](morality-evil.md) with a highly [distorted image](image-distortion.md). More often, they start good and turn bad. At least, they start as good as [human nature](humanity.md) can [make](creations.md) it.

By "bad", something has been [purposed](purpose.md) or repurposed to the point that it doesn't [add legitimate value](meaning.md), [foster growth](people-changes.md), or inspire [moral behavior](morality.md). The causes are from evil or incompetence and don't have to be [intentional](purpose.md). But, [evil](morality-evil.md) people can (and eventually do if when they amass enough [power](power.md)) direct a group's [purpose](purpose.md) to a malicious [end](results.md). This begins when the entity starts acting toward the best interests of the [leadership](groups-large.md) instead of the group ("realpolitik").

Tragically, the worst bad systems were once serving a highly necessary (and often [virtuous](morality.md)) [purpose](purpose.md). Many times, they'll outlive their original [goals](purpose.md) (e.g., "[awareness](awareness.md)" of a disease or fighting an [injustice](morality-justice.md)) and will incessantly recycle a [trend](trends.md) into obsolescence.

A bad system has clear indicators:

- Individuals who want to advance self-interested [purposes](purpose.md) must frequently [do](results.md) very specific, unusual things they wouldn't have done otherwise.
- The most [creative](mind-creativity.md) or [productive](results.md) members [loyal](trust.md) to the group can't work as hard as they want or create better solutions.
- Any [safety](safety.md) measures either don't work or aren't honored.
- [Measurements](math.md) to judge merit in the system are easy to cheat at, and most members do.
- Leaders have no motivation to value merit, so they promote people who fit their [preferences](humanity.md). Over time, all the leadership will look eerily similar because they've all been [close friends](people-friends.md) for a long time.
- People are [unsafe](safety.md) or [dying](mind-feelings-fear.md), but the leaders either don't acknowledge it or [shift blame](image-distortion.md).
- The [image](image.md) of the [organization](groups-large.md) as seen from outside is vastly different from [the reality](reality.md) inside it.
- The [documentation and communication](language.md) is vague or difficult to [understand](understanding.md), and often obsolete.
- Any processes or systems have a slow response time or are utterly insufficient for what they're supposed to do.
- The leadership is unusually [young](maturity.md), unusually [related](people-family.md) to the rest of the leadership, or all share membership of a smaller and unrelated special interest group.

One of the most frequent behaviors of bad systems is to suppress better solutions to [problems](purpose.md) they may not provide themselves. That way, they can continue benefiting from a less sufficient service:

- Big ice worked very hard to prevent refrigerators, including deceptive [advertising campaigns](marketing.md) that implied children would get trapped inside and die.
- A simple cure for cancer, if it exists, would never be as profitable as [all the treatments](body-4_health.md).
- [Tax filing](money-accounting.md) services in the USA presently work to prevent free tax filing services through the government.

## Magnification

In any group, everyone's [understanding](understanding.md) and ability increases over time, but *also* their foolishness and incompetence.

Bad systems arise from relatively unimportant details at first:

- The members don't [respect](image.md) their leadership.
- Someone is promoted to leadership who isn't the best [fit](purpose.md) for the role. This can come from that person having poor [boundaries](people-boundaries.md) with others, no skill, or [evil](morality-evil.md) intent.
- Some of the organization's [rules](people-rules.md) are irrelevant and nobody updated it.
- The organization must respond to other outside groups for many of their [decisions](decisions.md).

As the organization scales and everyone [specializes](jobs-specialization.md), the members have informal [conversations](people-conversation.md) with one another about the [group's](groups-member.md) issues. Once multiple people agree on how the group's [culture](people-culture.md) doesn't address practical things, they feel [confident](understanding-certainty.md) that the thing is [reality](reality.md) and not merely [an improbable event](math.md).

Once people know they're not [delusional](reality.md), they're more willing to break the group's [rules](people-rules.md). Eventually, the entire organization suffers collective decay as [motivations](purpose.md) toward self-interest override the motivation for any [collective good](morality.md).

The [moral](morality.md) decay among individuals comes through several key motivators:

- Pressure to maintain [a numerical standard](math.md).
- [Fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) that leads to silence about perceived issues, including [conflicts](people-conflicts.md) of interest.
- The [dominant leadership](groups-small.md) has a nearly [cult](culture-cults.md)-like [influence](influence.md) over the [youngest members](maturity.md) of the group.
- The secondary leadership is weak compared to the dominant leaders and many lower-ranking members, meaning they're [easy to control](image-distortion.md) and not [respected](power.md).
- The group is *very* [influential](influence.md) in its [specialization](jobs-specialization.md), meaning they're often above accountability and can justify [immoral actions](morality.md) with other good actions.

## Bad appointment

Members can contribute to a dysfunctional system, but the leaders' decisions have a far more profound effect on the group. They will promote [values](values.md) that endorse or, at the very least, permit activities that harm the [group at large](groups-member.md).

One person with [malicious or selfish](morality-evil.md) intent in a key position of [influence](influence.md) in a system can often *destroy* that system's [effectiveness](purpose.md). Even in a large group, it can reduce their productivity by upwards of 40%.

Often, bad leaders can quickly emerge in a good system:

- Inheriting the system from someone else, but without any skills or [ability](understanding.md) to lead.
- Maintaining well-enough for a long time, but a [traumatic experience](hardship-ptsd.md) in their [personal life](people-family.md) destroys their ability to lead.
- Appointed through legitimate competence in a different field, but unable to [perform](results.md) as a leader. The [culture](people-culture.md) will then forbid them from demotion again ([Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)).
- Using raw [power](power.md), such as military strength, to seize control, then not delegating to capable people once they've acquired it.
- Subtly using subversive tactics like [bribery, blackmail, extortion, or murder](morality.md) to direct the flow of [power](power.md) to themselves.
- Winning people by [influence](influence.md) and a [positive image](image.md), but unable to fulfill [stated promises](people-contracts.md). This often comes from [distorting their image](image-distortion.md) to fully blame the incumbent and promising to be the solution.
- Mentally unwilling to [change](people-changes.md) or intentionally [surrounded](people-friends.md) with similar people who don't [challenge](people-conflicts.md) existing viewpoints.
- [Preferential](purpose.md) promotion instead of the most [capable](results.md) person for the role. With enough time, creates a small [group-in-a-group](groups-small.md) of only approved leadership.
- An outside group wields its [power](power.md) without [opposition](people-conflicts.md), where the leadership can't stop it.
- Pressure by [in-fighting](people-conflicts-war.md) among the members to [decide](decisions.md) against the interests of the group.

The most tragic part of bad leaders is that their efforts are often [well-intended](purpose.md), but they either have a [defective philosophy of humanity](politics-leftism.md) or simply don't have the [personality](personality.md) to lead.

Any system can fall apart into a bad system, since the most reliable way to gain [power](power.md) is to skim just a little off each entity instead of exploiting one of them severely. This can mean payment processors, fee collectors, and others are most likely to become the bad system, but it can be anyone who is willing to harm many people only a little bit.

## Bad management

Many specific, bad leadership [decisions](decisions.md) can [create](creations.md) a bad system:

- [Redundant policies](bureaucracy.md) that add extra work but don't add value to the organization's [knowledge](understanding.md) or [power](power.md). This can come from double-entering information or cross-referencing two systems that draw from the same source.
- [Security](safety.md) [policies](people-rules.md) that don't adapt to [trends](trends.md) and [technology](technology.md). They won't protect much from anyone with enough [desire](purpose.md) and a little [creativity](mind-creativity.md), but will stifle members from [creating](creations.md) legitimately [useful](purpose.md) things for the organization. The clearest indicator is when members only have partial [information](understanding.md) to do the task, but no idea of the [consequences](results.md) of their task.
- It's much easier to make new [rules](people-rules.md) than amend old ones, especially long-standing rules. Most [members](groups-member.md) [trust](trust.md) there's a good [reason](purpose.md) for the rules and build [habits](habits.md) around them. Leaders often [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) short-term [changes](people-changes.md) that may affect members' [productivity](results.md) or erode their [trust](trust.md) in the [group](groups-member.md), even if it's an incredibly beneficial long-term decision.
- Low-rank members rarely [care](people-love.md) about their organization as much as the leaders. However, they often [appear](image.md) to be loyal to please their leaders. A leader unaware of this will make catastrophically stupid decisions based on all the members' attitude being the same as the leaders'.
- If leaders inherit a system, they may not [know](understanding.md) what the previous leader had been doing or why. They'll often keep existing [rules](people-rules.md) to maintain [routines](habits.md), but add more. This makes tasks excessively complicated and more time-consuming, which the individuals will eventually learn to streamline by ignoring at least some rules.
- Tests may [appear](image.md) to verify aptitude or [understanding](understanding.md), so leaders will sharply define roles with them, but they can be manipulated through [influencing](influence.md) the test proctors, [memorizing](mind-memory.md) the answers in advance, or studying only portions of the curriculum that will be on the test.
- Leaders will often disregard relevant [trends](trends.md) and [technologies](technology.md) that would change the system's role or [importance](purpose.md) to members and outside groups. This often comes from complacency or forgetting how [power](power.md) can shift at the speed of [changed](people-changes.md) [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md).
- Some leaders focus solely on [image](image.md) over [substance](reality.md) by [creatively](mind-creativity.md) manipulating [numbers](math.md) and [distorting image](image-distortion.md). This can often mislead other [powerful](power.md) people/groups and give undeserved credibility or shame.
- Many leaders will take the group's [power](power.md) for granted, then make decisions that fulfill their personal [desires](purpose.md) instead of the best interests of the group.
- If the [predictions](imagination.md) of the leaders become inaccurate enough, they'll blow vast amounts of [power](power.md) on useless projects with an unclear or ineffective [purpose](purpose.md).

Often, since the leadership won't particularly care about the unspoken masses of people outside their group, their mismanagement will be magnified by the other people they listen to. Instead of paying attention to the most thought-provoking criticism, they'll usually pay more attention to the majority (who are often [biased](mind-bias.md) toward [political fashions](politics-conservativeliberal.md) or simply acting on their first-impulse [emotions](mind-feelings.md)) or their superiors (who are often biased toward [more power](power-types.md)).

Usually, the worst systems are made of *multiple* bad leadership decisions that feed into each other, and often across multiple leaders who didn't know what the previous leader had been doing or how to run an organization [wisely](understanding.md).

Frequently, bad systems are [legally](people-rules.md) forbidden or have too much to lose to say "no", so they find methods to make people give up without them having to say it:

- Creating a [bureaucratic system](bureaucracy.md) of different departments that can redirect people endlessly until they give up.
- Creating internal organizational [rules](people-rules.md) vague enough or unenforceable enough that organization members can flout at any time, but permits the member to say "company policy" for an undisclosed [purpose](purpose.md).
- Making scheduled events absurdly difficult for individuals to accomplish specific purposes (e.g., a technician will be at a residence in a few weeks sometime during that day).
- Finding alternative stated purposes for not performing an action (e.g., a sexist/racist saying someone "isn't a good fit for the organization").

Of course, [evil](morality-evil.md) intent can lead to horrible management as well. However, their [purposes](purpose.md) will be more [focused](purpose.md) on unfairly destroying [specific members](groups-member.md) who adhere to [ideas](values.md) the leadership doesn't [agree with](people-conflicts.md) or threatens their [power](power.md):

- Promising to give more [freedoms](people-boundaries.md), but taking away members' [power](power.md) on the pretense of keeping everyone [safe](safety.md).
- [Distorting](image-distortion.md) who [appears](image.md) to be responsible, then delivering the [consequences](results.md) of [rules](people-rules.md) on specific people who may have not deserved it.
- Using [doublespeak](language.md) to hide [intent](purpose.md) while making [promises](people-contracts.md), or outright breaking promises when it serves [self-interest](purpose.md) later.
- Fiercely [attacking](people-conflicts-war.md) an outside group, often with the [implication](image.md) of delivering [justice](morality-justice.md).
- Taking advantage of the lead times between [lying](people-lying.md) and others [finding out](understanding.md).

If everyone in a group is sufficiently educated, the leadership can't maintain its power. However, [education](education.md) requires work, so the leadership will [skew the truth](image-distortion.md):

- It's human nature that nobody likes to be blamed, and people will often [tweak their image](image-distortion.md) to sidestep it. However, bad leadership *constantly* tries to redirect blame. Usually, they'll be [unfairly punitive or gracious](morality-justice.md) to the subject of their blame. They're simply taking advantage of the opportunity, and tend not to sincerely [believe](understanding-certainty.md) anything they say.
- Frequently, the leadership of a bad system can find other unaffiliated groups to act as a third party (e.g., consultant, outside group). If anything wrong happens, they can always shift blame to that third party and sever ties with them to [maintain their image](image-distortion.md). Then, they can simply travel to one of that third party's competitors (who don't [communicate](people-conversation.md) the [risks](safety.md) of working with them). If the victim group's [specialization](jobs-specialization.md) is in enough of a [cycle](trends.md), there will be a never-ending supply of blame-shifting until all new entrants to that market are exhausted.
- Often, when the system is older than the leader, they'll find ways to blend in by saying and doing what other leaders in other bad systems are doing. By conforming to existing [standards](imagination.md), the premise is that they can't be blamed because they were simply honoring the standard.
- Create a relatively small spectrum of what is deemed as acceptable opinion, then foster [fierce debates](people-conflicts.md) within that smaller domain to redirect from the larger spectrum of ideas.

Other times, the leaders of a good system will try to seize more power beyond the group's [specialty](jobs-specialization.md). This shift will transition the group's priorities and [identity](identity.md), often leaving it far-removed from its original [mission](purpose.md).

Occasionally, a leader will forget the [values](values.md) that gave them power and will [decide](decisions.md) against those values. This will result in the group breaking from that leader's [purposes](purpose.md). Then, another leader will arise to replace the void, which can trigger the necessary changes to fix the dysfunction.

However, leadership shifts will *very* rarely fix anything. The people who have the means to assume power tend to reinforce the [culture](people-culture.md) of the existing system, and will therefore reinforce most of the bad decisions of the predecessor. The only changes will be relatively minor, but they may simply swap out extremes (e.g., harshness replaced by indolence).

If the organization persists to a [successor](legacy.md), the new leadership will often consist of a unique class of several groups of people:

1. [Friends](people-friends.md) and [family](people-family.md) of the present leaders (i.e., nepotism).
2. Members [enslaved](slavery.md) to the organization who have proven their loyalty to the leaders' [values](purpose.md) (i.e., a puppet).
3. Individuals who haven't proven their loyalty, but show enough [power](power.md) that they can (and might) overpower the leadership (i.e., a populist).

These leaders will likely have *no* aptitude or [ethics](morality.md) in comparison to their predecessors. Unlike the group's founders, the people who take over will only have one [social class](classes.md) to draw experience from, so they'll be outmatched by most of the competition inside their organization, as well as *any* outside competitor.

## Adapting members

Most of the time a bad system has [culturally](people-culture.md) normalized bad [boundaries](people-boundaries.md), and often punishes people who don't honor those bad boundaries.

Most people in a bad system are at least somewhat [creative](mind-creativity.md), even if strictly from boredom. If they're [low-conscientiousness](personality.md) enough to not rise into leadership or get ejected from the group, they'll conform to their environment:

- Working slower or less efficiently to pad out time.
- Creating tons of documentation to [appear](image.md) productive or embellish their [importance](purpose.md).
- Furthering their personal [education](education.md) or [career](jobs-specialization.md) with the organization's resources, with the full intent to abandon that organization later.
- Using the organization's resources for personal use, but hiding it or [lying](people-lying.md) about it.

Many of the members will be entitled, but won't add any [value](values.md) to the organization or what the organization [does](purpose.md).

Most leaders, when confronted with this issue, *should* evict or discipline those members to benefit the group. However, if a system is bad enough, the leadership would have to get rid of half the people in their group to have *any* accountability, and the best people for the roles would be gone. Instead, the leaders tend to create [measurements](math.md) and numerical reports to keep people productive, which leaves them in the same place, but with the illusion of things happening.

With any measured report, [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law) will typically come into full effect. People will quickly abuse a measurement to gain from it, so any measurement will become a bad indicator of success when it becomes the [goal](purpose.md). Either the leader must keep [shifting around](people-changes.md) the measurement or trust the sub-leaders' [intuitions](mind-feelings.md). More often, the leaders simply settle on measuring [money](power-types.md).

Just because a system has become awful doesn't mean it's useless. The group can still recruit and retain high-[quality](values-quality.md) membership:

- People will still often join a group without any [passion](purpose.md) for that group's [vision](purpose.md). They'll only transition through the group as long as the leadership [expects](imagination.md) they'll satisfy their [purposes](purpose.md) (such as gaining [money](power-types.md) or [influence](influence.md) beyond that group), and the high-quality people will tend to operate closer to the fringe of the group.
- If the [leader](groups-large.md) is particularly savvy, they'll hire the smartest people they can find for a task. This will ensure that the person is working *for* them instead of the risk of working against them.
- Many people see [large groups](groups-large.md), of any type, as [safer](safety.md) than [small groups](groups-small.md), and they'll join from that [appearance](image.md) if they're averse to [social risk](socialrisk.md).
- Since their experiences can't guide them, [young people](maturity.md) and [fools](understanding.md) are susceptible to following the [impressions](image.md) they felt from the group, even if those ideals are impossible to [attain](results.md).
- [Evil](morality-evil.md) people may see the group as an excellent opportunity to control and gain [power](power.md). If the group persists with these people in it, they eventually become leadership and make the system even worse.

For whatever reason, the members don't have [confidence](understanding-certainty.md) in the [group](groups-member.md). They're using it for an ulterior [purpose](purpose.md).

## Growth

Many of the activities that define a bad system are variations of wise [investment](money-investing.md) concepts. Most of these can create tremendous growth over time:

- Make advantageous [agreements](people-contracts.md) by [influencing](influence.md) people to sacrifice key aspects of their [power](power-types.md) in exchange for power the system may not need as much (e.g., giving publicity for money).
- Get a significant discount from another group selling something, then sell it for a smaller discount to someone else. If possible, keep the [agreements](people-contracts.md) quiet and away from [public criticism](stories-storytellers.md).
- Instead of outright selling something, rent it out.
- Collect royalties on what *other* people [create](creations.md).
- Absorb risk by charging flat prices for things with a varying cost structure (e.g., it costs $40-110 to ship something, so charge $100 to do it).
- Re-invest *everything* to prevent making any taxable organizational [profit](money-accounting.md).

Further, as a system grows larger, it can take advantage of favorable situations *much* faster and more effectively than smaller groups:

- Use [tax shelters](money-accounting.md) to move the money into a tax-free arrangement, often with added publicity (e.g., owned not-for-profit organizations).
- Hire people from foreign regions where the work may be more affordable or advantageous to costs.

Very frequently, a bad system has the means to continue growing through questionably [ethical](morality.md) approaches:

- Issuing [loans](money-2_debt.md) to people who don't have the financial position (or [investing savvy](money-investing.md)) to pay them back, then taking the collateral for themselves once they miss a few payments.
- Falsely [advertising](marketing.md) in a way that's difficult to [prove](people-rules.md) is insincere.
- Charge rent and royalties at [unfairly](morality-justice.md) high rates, often permitting the parent organization to profit under a [contract](people-contracts.md) while the subsidiary organizations or individuals will get nearly nothing by comparison.
- Disregarding any [ethical considerations](morality.md) and taking advantage of the lettering of vaguely worded or poorly considered [laws](people-rules.md) to perform activities that are *not* in the spirit of its design.
- Underpaying the people in the group, often by implying the roles are tremendous [career-starting](jobs-1_why.md) opportunities or that the person can "grow with the company".
- [Distorting the truth](image-distortion.md) about a product in a way that either hides the harm it may cause or [advertises](marketing.md) a feature the product in no way can remedy. This can include coining the [term](language.md) for a new disease (e.g., halitosis) or bribing/deterring [scientists](science.md) to prevent research.

As they defeat progressively more competitors and gain more [power](power.md), a large system can operate at *enormous* scale, meaning they can act more efficiently than their competitors:

- Add a tiny fee to many, many small transactions (e.g., $2 isn't much, but becomes $2,000,000 across 100,000 people).
- Collect a small commission on many, many small transactions (e.g., 1% for 40,000 people spending $5 each is $2,000).
- Saving 15 seconds on a procedure to sabotage quality doesn't mean much, but can save 15,000,000 seconds across a million tasks.

Small adaptations can convert into a diminished relationship between quality and price.

Bad systems can only subsist and grow on [goods and services](results.md) treated as a commodity. If the objects are observed as new or special, skimming [quality](values-quality.md) is a *dramatic* problem. However, once an object becomes part of everyone's [habitual](habits.md) background, they have no reason to pay attention to quality. As much as people will condemn a bad system, they'll still use the [products](creations.md) until they find a suitable alternative.

Typically, the leader of a [large group](groups-large.md) is *not* aware they're inspiring a gigantic force of individuals that [portray](image.md) that leadership as an antagonist. Often, they have a sincere and misguided [belief](trust.md) that they're establishing a new level of [order](unknown.md), but either fail to incorporate [how humanity works](humanity-universals.md) (especially their [range of personalities](personality.md)) or [overstep their boundaries](people-boundaries.md). They'll often perform their tasks in secret, and it will often [backfire](stories-storytellers.md) later.

## Merging

A large group's expansion typically comes through taking over and absorbing other smaller groups, with a few tactics:

- [Selling](marketing.md) people on the [inspirational idea](purpose.md) itself, often with certain [religious](religion.md) implications. This can be a legitimately sincere desire if the person is receiving [company stock](money-investing.md) as compensation without any [strange arrangements](image-distortion.md) involved.
- Using [charm](influence.md) to convince smaller groups that their [security](safety.md) is far better than their [freedom](people-boundaries.md), often with a [contract](people-contracts.md) that provides *much* more benefit to the larger group.
- Using [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) to coerce them to give up, often through threats of the unknown, which can be accomplished effectively with anything that represents legitimate [risk](safety.md) to the smaller group (e.g., a pre-existing [story](stories.md) of their previous conquests, [legal](legal-safety.md) environment changing).

If a large business has been expanding their operations for a long time, they'll often create subsidiary organizations that do *nothing* but seek smaller groups to absorb ("roll-ups"):

1. Buy out numerous small organizations in many regions and combine them together.
2. Fire all the back-office staff that the larger organization can do better (e.g., [accounting](money-accounting.md), [management](mgmt-1_why.md)).
3. The collective organization is now capable of operating as one unit across many regions, with many added [logistics](logistics.md) benefits.

Often, a bad system will give incredibly generous incentives to the [smaller groups' leaders](groups-small.md) for them to step down from their leadership role ("golden parachutes").

In a merger or acquisition, a significantly larger group will merge and absorb the smaller group's [culture](people-culture.md) and names, but the smaller group will only exist as a name after that point. The original [spirit](values.md) of the group will be gone unless the larger group treats that smaller group as its own autonomous unit.

At some point, it'll make tremendous [marketing](marketing.md) sense to present a component of the organization with a separate [public image](image.md). Often, they can have such effective [marketers](stories-storytellers.md) that the public won't even *realize* it's the same organization!

In the political domain of a [free society](politics-systems.md), it takes many resources to win an election, proportionally to the size of the electorate. For that reason, every politician *requires* [funding](economics.md) from a large system, which distorts the interests of the public at large.

Government bureaus work similarly to business units in merging, but without the [economic motivation](economics.md) and with a motivation for [control](power.md), and typically through a top-down consolidation of departments through a government order instead of any agreement.

## Monopoly

At some point, without a [large conflict](people-conflicts-war.md) to keep a bad system beholden to [results](results.md), it becomes unstoppable by any competitors. Their sheer size in an [industry](jobs-specialization.md) will make them impossible to defeat through any conventional means. In other words, success for a [large group](groups-large.md) eventually becomes monopolization, at least toward a [niche](jobs-specialization.md).

It's worth noting that monopolies are *relatively* successful. It means there was a void that someone was waiting to [seize](socialrisk.md), and especially when there's a commodity which nobody cares where it came from (a product of [technological innovation](technology.md)).

When large systems [have control](politics-monopolies.md) of vast portions of entire [specializations](jobs-specialization.md), they can dictate what people must [choose](decisions.md) to build by redefining the [consequences](results.md) to reward/punish activities in line with the group's interests. It's [our nature](humanity-universals.md) to dislike competition, so it's an inevitability.

Gaining [power](power.md) usually takes far more effort than maintaining it. Instead of fighting *many* [competitors](people-conflicts.md) while focusing on much more powerful people, the fight is against other competitors in *other* groups and a few lower-ranking competitors who may become a future threat if not swiftly [dealt with](morality-evil.md).

Thus, once someone has command of a large system in a comparatively small domain, they'll often focus all their efforts on stifling [competition](people-conflicts.md). They'll usually become complacent and forget the organization's [purposes](purpose.md) they were originally trying to advance.

Each type of monopoly creates limits on members' [decision-making](decisions.md):

1. Horizontal control monopolies can make their services absolutely necessary or "too big to fail" if they control an entire phase of a [technology's](technology.md) method.
2. Vertical control monopolies control every stage of the process of a [creation](creations.md). This permits them to make things more affordably or higher quality, and is much harder to [measure](math.md).
3. Government monopolies are also called "dictatorships". While every government technically has a regional monopoly on killing people, they abuse their [power](power.md) when they don't permit people to freely move out from under the influence of their government.
4. Idea monopolies control a facet of society that doesn't [create](creations.md), but is a forum for [ideas](values.md). This one is far more abstract, but is the most severe monopoly because [ideas](values.md) begin *all* [creations](creations.md). It's difficult to spot, but watch out when [university educators](education.md) are run by intellectuals instead of [trade masters](jobs-specialization.md) or social media is run by censoring committees.

While a monopoly may not be corrupt in its inception, the most apparent indicator of corruption comes through the organization quietly decreasing the [value](values-quality.md) of their [created](creations.md) goods and services:

- Raising fees beyond natural [economic](economics.md) [trends](trends.md) like inflation, but without adding [quality](values-quality.md) to the offering.
- Decreasing the [quality](values-quality.md) of the organization's offerings, but without lowering their costs.
- Devoting more effort toward [advertising](image.md) to draw in people than to improving overall [quality](values-quality.md).
- Advancing a [conflict](people-conflicts-war.md) or [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) of that conflict, then [justifying](logic.md) a substandard situation with it (often by raising the price inappropriately).
- Under-producing the available product to create [scarcity](economics.md), then supplying plenty of the product later once the demand for it goes up.
- Giving varying regional prices for the same goods and services in relationship to *much* smaller competitors in that area ("price fixing").
- Prevent over-producing, since it'll [flood the market](economics.md) and drive down demand in relation to supply, and find ways to maintain it with everyone else in that domain.

To stifle new [trends](trends.md) that may unseat their [power](power.md), most monopolies try to shut down anyone taking the [necessary risks](socialrisk.md) to build a [competitive](economics.md) alternative that gives the public more [choices](decisions.md) ("anti-competitive practices"):

- Lowering prices beyond the lowest-possible cost of the item (i.e., taking a severe financial loss) to make it completely impossible for smaller [competitors](economics.md) to have a reasonably comparable price.
- Giving an "open forum" for discussion, but preventing dissenters from saying what they want.
- Observing any new [trends](trends.md), then buying out all the [ideas](mind-creativity.md) or their [creators](purpose.md) as they arise.
- Publicly shaming anyone [building](creations.md) a [technology](technology.md) (or the technology itself) that could render their most profitable endeavors obsolete.
- [Attacking](people-conflicts-war.md) any [intellectual property](legal-ip.md) that vaguely resembles the group's [symbols](symbols.md) or techniques (e.g., patent trolls).
- Driving down the monetary value of a competitor's organization via [smear campaign](stories-storytellers.md) or [sabotage](people-conflicts-war.md), then buying them out when they're *just* about to go out of business.
- Stalling and delaying reliable delivery of products to inhibit the [image](image.md) of a competitor.
- Blacklist anyone who performs business with a competitor, as well as forbidding business with anyone *else* who does business with that competitor.
- Buy out all key things the competitor may need (e.g., real estate, [logistics](logistics.md), factories).
- Continuing to create situations that generate problems the system was originally designed to solve.

One of the most significant features of a persistent monopoly is when people *outside* the group entirely (e.g., producers, consumers) have very little [power](power.md) compared to various middle individuals and groups with [obscured purposes](image-distortion.md).

Free societies come with unique problems, and [political parties](politics-conservativeliberal.md) can do an election-based version of the same thing:

- [Influence](influence.md) people to hate the opposition party with a [portrayed event](stories-storytellers.md) approximately 1-3 months before election day. This can include a [manufactured crisis](image-distortion.md).
- Have an electoral system that only has limited [regulation](people-rules.md) of the voting, then add in votes from another source. This can work if the vote is declared as [justice](morality-justice.md) only *without* the regulation.
- Disqualify votes through rules that are difficult to [define](language.md), but serve to benefit one political party more than the other.
- Maintain [power](power.md) with new legal directives after the public has voted the leader out, but before that leader must change roles with the next one.

With a government-funded institution (e.g., [public education](education.md)), the source of that organization's [power](power.md) and lack of competition gives them *much* more means to control, and it demonstrates itself through more [bureaucracy](bureaucracy.md) and [micromanagement](mgmt-1_why.md) than would otherwise exist.

Often, a bad system's leadership will ally with other large groups to suppress shared threats:

- Giving [power](power.md) to other groups' leaders to [influence](influence.md) them to steer clear of conflicting [purposes](purpose.md).
- Creating proxy organizations or appointing people who [appear](image.md) unrelated. Those people can then "verify" and "authorize" that group. They'll also sometimes discredit their source group's rivals with those organizations, who can often act without the [rules](people-rules.md) or formalized leadership of their host group.
- Conspiring with other [large groups](groups-large.md) to create [government rules](people-rules.md) that prevent other [smaller groups](groups-small.md) from [fairly](morality-justice.md) competing ("crony capitalism").
- Conspiring with other [large groups](groups-large.md) to prevent [smaller groups](groups-small.md) from establishing themselves in a domain ("cartels").
- Creating [rules](people-rules.md) that prevent people from competing with other organizations in the same domain for a certain amount of time after leaving that organization ("non-compete agreements").
- Using publicized [awards shows](stories-storytellers.md) to demonstrate "insider" [influence](influence.md) to signal affiliated groups.
- Delaying [law enforcement](people-rules.md) which may harm them for as long as possible, with the expectation that their opponents will run out of [hope](understanding-certainty.md) and no longer want to keep sacrificing resources for the conflict.
- Using protesters to "take action" through the [appearance](image-distortion.md) of being forced to act.

## Small opponents

Some people who witness these groups make it their personal agenda to destroy those systems. They'll [publish mass condemnation](stories-storytellers.md) of the group, gain [political](power-types.md) [power](power.md) to defeat them, and call attention to possible conspiracies.

A conspiracy is when two people or groups secretly try to do [evil](morality-evil.md) against a third. In that sense, *all* bad systems with *any* [intent](purpose.md) to destroy anyone are conspiring, and those people are often correct to draw attention to it.

Though it's not as common as the indirect approach, there are several ways an entity will destroy their opposition directly:

1. Take away their [power](power.md), in-system, often by demonetizing or [penalties](rules-methods.md)
2. Eject them from the group entirely
3. [attack them](people-conflicts-war.md) if they can successfully create another group

Leaders can also adapt [language](language.md) to represent the people paranoid about conspiracies as [fringe](trends.md) believers, then destroy their [credibility](image.md) in the process. In response, many of those people will often feed into their [fears](mind-feelings-fear.md) and reinforce unhealthy [bias](mind-bias.md) in their [stories](stories.md), further destroying their credibility.

Often, they'll be [portrayed](image.md) as the [martyrs of the trend](trends.md). This doesn't mean those people were necessarily [noble](morality.md), though. Those people were often [fairly](morality-justice.md) outmaneuvered by someone who out-succeeded them. Other times, they simply had a very confrontational [personality](personality.md) against *any* [authority figure](people-rules.md).

Smaller groups *do* have [options to fight back](people-conflicts-war.md), but require [creative](mind-creativity.md) and unconventional [risks](socialrisk.md) that often carry [unknown dangers](unknown.md), which typically can only succeed *outside* that large group's [influence](influence.md). And, even without direct control, large enough monopolies can usually find a way to make almost any activity profit them or prevent smaller opponents from succeeding.

A select few individuals can take a large-scale [social risk](socialrisk.md) against the bad system's purposes. By answering one of the bad system's [stated](image.md) [purposes](purpose.md) more effectively using recently developed [technology](technology.md) or [cross-cultural](people-culture.md) [understanding](understanding.md), that person can start a [trend](trends.md) that can unseat the current leaders' [power](power.md):

- North American colonists [fought](people-conflicts-war.md) and won against the British Empire by using Native Americans' guerilla warfare tactics.
- [Microsoft](computers-os-windows.md) sold a non-exclusive license to IBM, meaning other hardware companies could sell Microsoft software on cheaper hardware.
- [Military tactics](people-conflicts-war.md) *always* shift when a new [technology](technology.md) makes transporting things quicker or [safer](safety.md).

It's worth noting that the likelihood of any one of the smaller groups succeeding is infinitesimal. However, with enough of the hundreds or thousands of efforts, *someone* will succeed at their [risk-taking](socialrisk.md).

## Deconstruction

The only cure to avoid bad systems starting is a [completely free market](economics.md) combined with *tons* of focused [public attention](stories-storytellers.md) on those systems. By permitting the public to freely [decide](decisions.md), every organization must devote *all* their [effort](purpose.md) to improving the group's [quality](values-quality.md) or [image](image.md) to stay competitive. Without that external pressure, the organizations will instead [redirect](purpose.md) their [effort](results.md) to funneling and consolidating [power](power.md) upward.

At a certain point, though, a bad system will eventually emerge if they can amass enough alliances with other organizations, especially through pervasive [media](stories-storytellers.md) presence that [redirects the truth](image-distortion.md).

Several situations can, however, prolong or enhance a monopoly's presence:

1. A government can legally establish a monopoly for itself (i.e., make it illegal for private businesses to sell something).
2. A government can authorize only specific organizations to perform an activity (e.g., [patents](legal-ip.md), permits).
3. An organization funnels its control from a relatively unrelated domain to gain power in an otherwise under-served marketplace.
4. An organization can grow large enough where they can act beyond the scope of any government's control (e.g., multinational corporation, flouting government [rules](people-rules.md) while [politicizing](stories-storytellers.md) that they're "too big to fail").
5. Sometimes, they can get public opinion on their side through groups they privately control that advance their agenda (e.g., conveying an [image](image.md) that a group must be "free of political influence" to stop the big system).

The only solution to fixing a bad system from the inside is revolutionary [change](people-changes.md) on every level:

- Against [human nature](humanity-universals.md), the system dramatically sheds a huge chunk of its [power](power.md), giving it more control over its smaller remaining base.
- New management that throws out [convention](habits.md) and large portions of the organization's established [culture](people-culture.md). They'll introduce a new culture by promoting a few [easily distinguishable](understanding.md) and [influential](influence.md) [values](values.md).
- Massive reorganization of members and roles, with a significant portion of the group getting promoted or removed from the group.
- Adoption of a key [trend](trends.md) or [idea](values.md) that gives everyone more [reason](purpose.md) to be legitimately [virtuous](morality.md). This, however, can backfire if it's only [feigned](image-distortion.md) virtue (e.g., [leftism](politics-leftism.md)).
- Complete destruction of the group, often by removing the massive central authority and dividing the group into smaller components.

People don't typically like [change](people-changes.md), so the only way to make *all* the necessary changes is when the system is already disrupting everyone's [habits](habits.md). A crisis is the best trigger for this, but a [manufactured crisis](image-distortion.md) can [work just as well](results.md) if [people will buy it](influence.md).

The more likely scenario, though, for most bad systems, is decay through tribalism:

1. Within a [group](groups-large.md), the [selection](decisions.md) for members' [promotions](power-types.md) will be defined [intuitively](mind-feelings.md) by aptitude, at least at first.
2. Eventually, the leadership will introduce a [bias](mind-bias.md), often presented as enforcing [fairness](morality-justice.md). This bias (often [leftism](politics-leftism.md), but doesn't have to be) will over-emphasize a people group, typically racial or ethnic, and will naturally pick a "losing" subgroup.
3. The individuals, in individually-defined acts of self-preservation, will [identify](identity.md) (at least publicly) as anything *but* the scapegoat group.
4. The group's and leadership's judgments will slowly base on secondary characteristics to aptitude, which may include racial or ethnic domains, or may branch into another division (e.g., [ideology](values.md)).
5. By the time any of the above expresses explicitly, the group is mostly beyond restoration, and its success will follow its most effective factions.

Ironically, the [middle-class](classes.md) people in a group become that organization's hope. The upper-class are too concerned with [power](power.md) (and will do whatever it takes to get more of it) and the lower-class are too concerned with [survival](mind-feelings-fear.md) (and will take short-term [promises](people-contracts.md) without considering their viability or long-term benefit). In particular, the lower-class opinion will become "tyranny of the majority".

Of course, this will often be met by [dramatic conflict](people-conflicts-war.md) from members who had more power, as well as risks from outside groups who may [influence](influence.md) the new leadership. However, they won't have the means to build the skills necessary for a critical [trend](trends.md) that comes from [what they can't know](unknown.md). For that reason, every large group leader always persists only for a season, even when they can extend it with many more [rules](people-rules.md) and [restrictions](rules-methods.md).

Fixing a bad system is unlikely, and the better solution is to tear it down and start again entirely. Generally, they can only be defeated by implosion through their incompetence (and thereby motivating people to do *anything* else) or through defeat by something [stronger](power.md) than it. In the event of an attack, they'll [fight](people-conflicts-war.md) desperately to maintain their [power](power.md), so the implosion from inside is preferable for everyone else.

The destruction of a bad system is very near when more effort is spent on things that don't add value to the organization's [purpose](purpose.md), and there is a public image that that is the case.

## Trended destruction

On the way down, every bad system will at least partially destroy its [legacy](legacy.md) through corruption.

A bad system can become permanently hampered, which opens the path for other groups to intervene:

- Unionized workers who require higher pay but with no incentive to work harder (since unions are based strictly on length of time existing in the [group](groups-member.md)).
- Government [laws](people-rules.md) that prohibit expansion into new related territories (e.g., AT&T's lack of expansion permitted [computers](computers.md) to exist separately from AT&T).
- People who die using their service or product, or die while trying to publicize the organization's failings. If the deaths are [advertised](stories-storytellers.md) severely enough (which means the system didn't bribe media outlets enough), the organization can incur a [long-term mark](image.md) on its reputation. This can be extra effective if the story is [interesting or symbolic](symbols.md).

There's no easy way to replace a bad system, either:

1. Present, chronic issues use specific resources that bad systems capitalize on. The only way to resolve the problem requires [creative](mind-creativity.md), new solutions with resources that aren't technically [useful](purpose.md) yet.
2. In civilized society, people are typically [habituated](habits.md) to the present system by the time they're aware it needs fixing. The entire culture around a specific [purpose](purpose.md) often becomes a toxic, [incompetent](purpose.md), or [evil](morality-evil.md) [culture](people-culture.md).
3. Frequently, [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) of the [unknown](unknown.md) keeps people tethered to a bad system, a bit like an abusive [family](people-family.md) relationship.

A bad system will often be replaced by a much more efficient, newer system that doesn't have quite as much [bureaucracy](bureaucracy.md) or [corruption](morality-evil.md). However, the [personalities](personality.md) of *that* system's leaders may be more ruthless or extreme.

One of the most significant ways a bad system loses public favor is when they *completely* fail the [trust](understanding-certainty.md) of the public who had placed faith in them:

- Violate private individuals' [rights](people-boundaries.md), usually in a way that people die. This gets worse if they try to bury or destroy the evidence of their actions, and can be *much* worse if it's a new [technology](technology.md) (since it'll magnify everyone's [fears](mind-feelings-fear.md) of the [unknown](unknown.md)).
- Suffer a [logistical](logistics.md) failure that creates a supply chain disruption, often in a way that people are permanently injured or die.
- Create something and [advertise](marketing.md) it as a dramatic new [trend](trends.md), but it's [poorly designed](results.md) to make them the object of [ridicule](humor.md) or the trend is absolutely [taboo](morality-taboo.md).

In fact, most large-scale bad systems are an existing optimization of a *previous* bad system (e.g., more efficient, affordable, economical, [fair](morality-justice.md), et al.). However, this came at the expense of sacrificing very intimate [human needs](humanity.md) in the process. The [deals](people-contracts.md) were more ruthless, everyone became more [specialized](jobs-specialization.md), collectively more [powerful](power.md), systems became more [standardized](mgmt-1_why.md), and each person became less individually [important](meaning.md) compared to the [organization](groups-large.md).

However, between stopping the old system and starting the new one, even *basic* tasks can be spectacularly troublesome for a short time.

Depending on their [scope of power](politics-monopolies.md), both governments and corporations have differing competitive elements that could erode a bad system's [influence](influence.md):

- A gigantic corporation can be subdued or divided on the outside by a government, often by labeling them as a "common carrier" and requiring they stay autonomously separate.
- In the absence of government intervention, a corporation must be starved by *another* corporation that serves [members'](groups-member.md) interests better.
- A government or political party can only be stopped by another government/party with more [power](power.md) or in another country, assuming they haven't oppressed the people enough to make them [revolt](people-conflicts-war.md) or break the [rules](people-rules.md).
- Any terrible government or corporation, however, will fall apart quickly if the public finds a reliable way to live without it, though governments may overstep their power to keep their control.

Generally, large private organizations fall apart through public resentment that fosters a [trend](trends.md) that empowers the [risk-averse](safety.md) people in power to act (who tends to work within a government). Then, the void created by that government entity gives enough power for [risk-taking](socialrisk.md) private individuals to fill that void.

Government divisions of corporations never work well, though. The barriers to growing larger tend to create [corporatocracy](politics-systems.md) in that domain, and [legal definitions](people-rules.md) can be massaged over time by many [lawyers](legal-safety.md) to permit subversive tactics.

Often, our [human nature](humanity-universals.md) makes *every* system bad in some way, so it's not always wise to trust the enemy of an enemy.

Bad systems will always decay until they're brought down or rebuilt into something else through the inevitable deterioration and rebalancing of [trust](trust.md) by its members. However, people are happy to permit a slightly [evil](morality-evil.md) leader if that leader still serves the individuals' self-interests, and long-term leadership will create enough [precedent](habits.md) that everyone will feel [safe](safety.md) with the existing order, even if the leadership starts killing people.

Over time, if a bad system is left unmaintained, but stays connected to the social [networks](https://gainedin.site/networks/) around it, the traits of that bad system will represent onto the larger system. Over time, *that* entity will become a more disturbing reproduction of the first one.

## The solution

One of the most powerful forms of destroying a bad system comes through mandatory transparency. It's impossible for bad systems to present the openness that more effective organizations could provide. If enough competing entities give that openness, the older systems will be required to divulge more information, which makes corruption harder to perform.

Transparency is technically impossible to completely attain, since some information must be private to avoid harming [reputation](image.md). However, transparency is an absolute concept in comparison with other entities' openness of information. There are many [creative](mind-creativity.md) ways to state the blatant truth without using names.

It takes years to develop a [cultural](people-culture.md) expectation of transparency, but it guarantees *all* future systems will be better for it.

## Application

APPLICATION: If anyone deems an organization as "too big to fail", the more accurate description is "so big it'll inevitably fail".

APPLICATION: A political revolution is often a bad system, especially when run by [extremist groups](politics-leftism.md). This is because most [political systems](politics-conservativeliberal.md) are bad systems. They tend to blame the opposition more than [getting things done](results.md), and this will likely never change.

APPLICATION: Scandals are common because leaders have to enforce an [image](image.md) of values, but they're human and fallible.

APPLICATION: Most [large systems](groups-large.md) are at least partly bad systems. Before destroying them, carefully consider what will replace it.

APPLICATION: Don't publicly shame a large system with hearsay or lies. Stay as close to [the truth](reality.md) as you possibly can (and make sure you know other people to advance [the cause](values.md) if they shut you down) or they'll repudiate you faster than you can respond.

APPLICATION: The more specific and odd a system's mandatory activities for success are, the worse the system is.

APPLICATION: The distinction between [evil](morality-evil.md) and incompetent leaders comes through intent. We can't see intent directly, but we *can* see who suffers in the system. Generally, very specific people suffering unfairly comes from evil, while everyone suffering is generally from incompetence.

APPLICATION: Very frequently, leaders of bad systems will congregate among each other in a subgroup of unhealthy [relationships](people-friends.md). They'll often do disturbing things together, and being part of the leadership requires sharing in those activities.

APPLICATION: The most conspicuous sign of a bad system first forming comes through a leader with a [moral](morality.md) conviction that may not be as moral as they think, but the not-so-moral [partners and friends](people-friends.md) they [trust](trust.md) advance that [idea](values.md) forward.

APPLICATION: Bad leaders are concerned about money, mostly because they're not thinking about members' [purposes](purpose.md) or [considering](understanding.md) the well-being of the organization.

APPLICATION: One way a system becomes bad is when outside parties like [specialized trade groups](jobs-specialization.md) and unions have more [power](power.md) than the leadership to make [decisions](decisions.md). They may serve the interests of individuals, but the leadership will be forced to be harsher to everyone to create the same [results](results.md) as before.

APPLICATION: In a large organization that's become a bad system, *all* the leadership is partially responsible. It's difficult to tell how much for each, though, since most committee-based leadership [decisions](decisions.md) are opaque, and they'll each blame everyone and everything but themselves. The only solution to reliably tell is to remove the leaders, one by one, put them in another situation, then closely watch the [changes](people-changes.md) to both the system they were removed from and the system they were placed in.

APPLICATION: Don't trust an organization as "bad" or "good" simply by their size. Sometimes, smear campaigns come from people who are bitter at their opponents' success. The only way to discover [the truth](reality.md) is to judge between the opposing viewpoints.

APPLICATION: All systems become bad eventually, at some point. They must then be rebuilt through a change in leadership or will be replaced by another system. Thus, all systems run through a relatively predictable [cycle](trends.md):

1. Establish themselves as a new [trend](trends.md).
2. Members question their leaders' [wisdom](understanding.md).
3. The leaders start abusing the group's [power](power.md) to maintain control.
4. [Strong](power.md) leaders are appointed more than [wise](understanding.md) or [good](morality.md) leaders.
5. The group becomes a bad system, ready for restructuring or another system to take its [power](power.md) away.

APPLICATION: Society will never work its issues out without massive, [large-scale transformation](politics-perfectsociety.md) of human [purpose](purpose.md) and [motivation](humanity.md). We'll always have a "deep state" inside every [large system](groups-large.md) waiting to abuse their [power](power.md) until another system of a new generation [takes its place](trends.md).

APPLICATION: Research *every* company you buy things from. You'll often find that the company is simply [one of the many faces](politics-monopolies.md) of a gigantic bad system.

APPLICATION: The only reason people use Verizon, Google, Facebook, Ford, and Coca-Cola right now is because they're [familiar](habits.md) with it or don't see much to [choose](decisions.md) instead. However, assuming they didn't exist, their present [quality](values-quality.md) probably isn't enough to start a new trend if people hadn't been familiar with it in the first place.

APPLICATION: Monopolies are inevitable as long as people desire [power](power.md). Antitrust [laws](people-rules.md) only work when they're too simple to abuse and enforced by governments, which is *another* potentially bad system that checks the first bad system. Typically, [technology's](technology.md) complexity makes regulating vertical control absolutely impossible. And, because of [how we understand reality](mind-bias.md), we can't easily regulate ideas (e.g., [misinformation](stories-storytellers.md), "fake news").

APPLICATION: Underused resources are just as critical to fixing a bad system as unused ones. Often, people need [creativity](mind-creativity.md) that only comes from leaving their [culture](people-culture.md) to find things [purposed](purpose.md) for one thing that can accomplish another.

APPLICATION: We don't like oppressive dictators, but there are *always* worse alternatives. Consider who's dethroning someone from [power](power.md) before endorsing it, especially with extreme groups like [hard leftism](politics-leftism.md).

APPLICATION: Government elections are corrupt proportionally to the amount of work it takes to even run a campaign. Therefore, corruption in government scales with population.

APPLICATION: As a weaker member of a group, the best bad systems to join are too busy fighting an external conflict to pay attention to you. If they *ever* defeat the external force, they'll come for you. If *every* system in an [industry](jobs-specialization.md) is bad, the best [decision](decisions.md) is to passively keep them fighting between each other and stay out of sight.

APPLICATION: There is one certain way to destroy a bad system, or at least injure it:

1. [Sell](marketing.md) your product as a superior [quality](values-quality.md), and make sure it really is (likely through a superior [technology](technology.md)).
2. Engage in *complete* information transparency and [advertise](stories-storytellers.md) that fact as well, including of that technology.
3. Others will imitate and steal ideas, but the horde of improved products with extra transparency will make that bad system irrelevant by comparison.
4. You won't get a reputation for it among the public, but will amass tremendous power through the [influence](influence.md) with the people who took your ideas, which you can summon later from their gratitude.

APPLICATION: Many of the large-scale conspiracies are probably somewhat true. There's also not much an average person can do about it individually, but if they stand up for themselves they can frequently start a [trend](trends.md) across various [media](stories-storytellers.md), since most people *do* see it but are [afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md) to speak up about it.

APPLICATION: Every large, bad system will eventually collapse. They will be replaced by another one of comparable [effectiveness](purpose.md). We must find [meaning](meaning.md) despite these perpetual, looming [threats](safety.md), which may or may not include directly confronting those systems, and might occasionally mean risking [dying](legacy.md) from it.

APPLICATION: People slowly permit [tyranny](power-types.md) into their lives when they accept what the leadership does. Since [power-hungry](power-types.md) people don't tend to demarcate a stopping point, that slow [consent](people-contracts.md) will eventually go too far, but often at the cost of many lives and many destroyed aspects of [civilization](jobs-specialization.md).

APPLICATION: The greatness of a nation is its own [trend](trends.md), but eventually they try to make everyone around them adopt that trend. When that happens, they [imagine](imagination.md) they're migrating their [culture](people-culture.md) across a vast domain, but they're also importing the cultures they're trying to influence at the same time. The byproduct of this is that the [quality](values-quality.md) that made them great becomes inferior relative to what it once was. Eventually, the entire culture becomes such a bad system that another culture will adopt the best parts and supersede it.
