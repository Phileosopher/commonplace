# Risk management checklist

This is a list of everything necessary to [manage risks](safety.md) that may come from [unknown sources](unknown.md).

[Organizational needs](mgmt-1_why.md) tend to practice this list as well, but *way* more in-depth with entire departments managing them:

- Occupational risk - the risk of doing something in the first place
- Inherent risk - the raw risk before any controls are put in place
  - Residual risk - risks that still exist after placing controls
- Operation risk - the chances of an organization's procedures failing
- Concentration risk - too many assets connected to one entity/client
- Legal/Compliance risk - the chance of lawsuits or [legal action](legal-safety.md)
- Reputation risk - the dangers of a defiled [public image](image.md)
- Strategic risk - the risks that come from any type of [internal changes](mgmt-7_changes.md)
- Global risk - the dangers from worldwide events
- Competitive risk - issues that may come from competitors acting against the entity's interests

Risk management involves treating or avoiding loss exposures:

1. Avoiding risk - simply *not* performing an activity that could carry a risk (e.g., general safety practices, [legal safety](legal-safety.md)).
2. Reducing risk - using risk control techniques to mitigate the scope of those risks (e.g., preventative efforts, installing fire sprinklers, security systems).
3. Retaining risk (self-insurance) - holding yourself financially responsible for all or part of a risk (e.g., [saving money](money-4_spending.md)).
4. Sharing risk - proportionally distributing risk among multiple individuals according to investment or need (e.g., [communal lifestyle](home-homestead.md), coinsurance/risk sharing agreement).
5. Transferring risk - arranging a contract for someone else to [take the risks entirely](money-insurance.md) (e.g., paying a fee to an insurer, subcontracting work to another entity, a lease arrangement).

Please note, this only creates [meaning](meaning.md) if it *might actually happen*, and preferably for others' benefit, or it's simply the never-ending motivation of [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md). It's also fear when it doesn't respect others' [decisions](decisions.md) to expose *themselves* to risk.

Most of this checklist revolves around the [security](safety-security.md) from avoiding and reducing risk, since preventing risks is *much* less work than trying to resolve them once they've happened.
