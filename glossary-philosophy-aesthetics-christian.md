# The Christian values on aesthetics

## What should we define as quality?

**Aestheticism** can be very true in Christianity, particularly if a relationship with God is not built inherently on a [purpose](purpose.md) but instead on an essence.

While **aesthetic formalism** has merit, it goes too far if it straddles into someone's ethical issues with a social or historical context.

**Romanticism** has value until it becomes an ethical consideration.

### The verdict on what we should define as quality

Possible (and useful)

- Aestheticism

Possible (or partial)

- Aesthetic formalism (until it defiles another's conscience)
- Romanticism (until it becomes an ethical matter)

## How should we [create](mind-creativity.md)?

It's hard to *not* argue that God's divinely inspired [creations](creations.md) are performed via **automatism**, and worth considering in light of [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md).

**Classicism** is a *huge* aspect of Christian tradition, especially with respect to art.

In a sense, creating without a focus on God can be risky, and **modernism** and **primitivism** can create adverse consequences when not merged with other values.

While creating against the essence of order can magnify the human experience, there's a "middle ground" in the domains of **expressionism**, **surrealism**, and **symbolism** that avoids detracting from God's glory.

### The verdict on how we should create

True

- Automatism (for Scripture)

Possible (and useful)

- Automatism (for everything we make)
- Classicism

Possible (or partial)

- Expressionism
- Surrealism
- Symbolism

Possible (but difficult)

- Modernism
- Primitivism
