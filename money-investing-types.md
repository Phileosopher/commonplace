# The types of investments

When compared to other investments, each individual investment has four possible advantages, but never all at once:

1. Low risk - Less chance you'll lose your money
2. High returns - more money back
3. Low taxes - less money goes to the government
4. Low fees - less money goes to other people

All investment returns only come from 3 possible sources:

1. Dividends - you own something, then receive proceeds that originally came from someone else's [labor](results.md)
2. Price appreciation - the market value of something you own moves upward
3. Lending with [interest](money-2_debt.md) or rent - payment to use something
4. Flipping - providing dividends, price appreciation, or interest/rent to others by using their money

Generally, every trading system goes through a [trend](trends.md) of growth, but becomes less effective over time.

- Frequently, investors will jump in the middle to create additional products that reduce earnings while also mitigating risk.
- At some point, the system will start lagging on its exchange/market updates.

For many of the below, there are also [contracts](people-contracts.md) for future investments, called options:

- Call options allow someone the right (but not the obligation) to *buy* something at a future time for a set price.
  - This is most frequent in stock markets, where someone can pay a relatively small amount to gamble on an unlikely situation (e.g., a very affordable call option for selling a stock at 5 times its current value).
- Put options allow someone the rights (but not the obligation) to *sell* something at a future time for a set price.
  - Puts most frequent for startup investors, who have the right later to sell the company stock if they want to cash out.
- Both of them typically have a fixed expiration date, which means they have to exercise those options by that time or the contract is terminated.
- The strike price is the required price the underlying asset has to arrive at to have any legitimate value.
  - An option is in-the-money or out-of-the-money based on its call/put price relative to the market price.
- Stock options are a great way to plan ahead to invest, but without actually investing.
  - Restricted stock units (RSUs) are the most common, and have a certain amount of time to vest before they become like normal stock options.
  - If you're a market maker, buying puts is an excellent way to plan ahead for a market crash.
- Shorting a market (e.g., 2007-2008 housing market collapse, 2021 Gamestop short squeeze) is a specific type of option called a short position:
  1. Send a short order to a broker (often within a margin account) and publicly disclose that desire.
  2. The broker lends you that asset and sells them for you at the normal price.
  3. You gain cash from the sale, but must now pay off the debt.
  4. If the asset drops in value, you can pay less and buy back the same number of assets.
  5. You'll keep the price difference as your profit.

Investing in a market gives more data, but investing in-person allows you to work with your experience.

- However, informally investing all depends on your capacity to judge people:
  - Trusting people too little means you'll miss out on numerous opportunities.
  - Trusting people too much means you'll be exploited and possibly scammed.

## 1. Dividends

In any formal market (e.g., stock market), dividends are the most common type of investment.

- They have *countless* options, features, and opportunities.

Stocks (to receive company dividends) - owning a portion of a company:

- High risk, high returns, moderate taxes, moderate fees.
- Often listed on a stock market, but is often unlisted.
- Pros:
  - High long-term returns of about 10-12%.
  - Good for retirement.
  - Relatively short time to learn enough to invest.
  - Depending on how the company [manages its equity](money-accounting.md), may also appreciate in price and act as a commodity.
- Cons:
  - You can lose everything if you don't know what you're doing.
  - Not diversified unless you own at least 35-50 stocks.
  - If a company goes bankrupt, you lose the entire investment.
  - Not very likely to beat the market's returns (e.g., DJIA, NASDAQ, S&P).
  - Self-managed taxes.
- The most stable equity industries are providing a service everyone absolutely needs:
  - Electric, oil, and gas utilities
  - Consumer [electronics](computers.md)
  - [Cars](autos.md)
  - [Logistics](logistics.md)
  - [Food](cooking.md)
  - [Healthcare](body-4_health.md)
- If it's a foreign stock market, it may be subject to higher fees and more risks of political unrest sabotaging the investment.

Mutual funds - multiple investors combine their money, then a fund manager buys and sells securities to increase returns:

- Medium risk, medium returns, moderate/high taxes (depending on political climate), high fees.
- When picking a fund:
  - Each trade will likely incur fees or commissions, so avoid actively managed funds.
  - The expense ratio will tell you how much the fund operator makes each year.
  - Pay more attention to what the fund manager is investing *toward* than their rate of return.
- Pros:
  - Decent long-term returns of about 7%.
  - Built for more diversification than stocks.
  - A great fund manager will stay with the market's trends.
  - Relatively short time to learn enough to invest.
  - Has very few limits to how much money you need.
  - Index funds that track the stock market have a [geometric average](math-algebra.md) of 6.9% per year.
- Cons:
  - An inept fund manager will create many risks.
  - Rises and falls more closely with the stock market than individual stocks.
  - An actively investing fund manager will incur more fees than if you simply invested into a generic fund.
- Mutual funds have many types:
  - Index Fund - follows a stock market index's ups and downs closely (e.g., NASDAQ or DJIA).
    - Usually the safest and most reliable funds.
    - Can be inexpensive and are often well-diversified.
  - Growth and Income Fund - big, boring long-time companies which sell staple goods and services.
  - Growth Fund - made of higher-risk growing medium/large company stocks.
  - Aggressive Growth Fund - very high-risk, high-return.

  - Bond Fund - made of bonds.
  - ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) - a mutual fund that can be traded on a public exchange.
    - The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) is one of the most popular broad bond index funds.
  - REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) - a fund, but with real estate investments.
  - Hedge Fund - uses complex trading and risk management techniques.
    - Historically, hedge funds were designed to short the market and "hedge" risk, but can now apply to anything outside conventional investment activities.
- A fund can have a group of essentially *anything* the fund manager wants, and some ETFs are entertainingly odd:
  - Columbia EM Core ex-China ETF (XCEM) - non-China regions that serve what China serves (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Brazil).
  - iPath Bloomberg Livestock Subindex Total Return ETN (COW) - specifically in live cattle and lean hogs.
  - The Obesity ETF (SLIM) - obesity and health issues.
  - Global X Millennials Thematic ETF (MILN) - millennial consumer habits.

  - Becky ETF - tracks white American teenage girls' consumer habits.
  - The Inverse Cramer ETF (SJIM) and The Long Cramer ETF (LJIM) - tracks everything *against* Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV show recommendations.
- Investing for returns across the market is much easier than obsessing over it:
  - You don't have to pay attention to financial media or mountains of [conflicting information](information.md) from [self-proclaimed experts](education.md).
  - The fees are less expensive and the results are dramatically superior.
  - You won't need an advisor or broker, and it takes 90 minutes or so per year to work directly with brand-name mutual fund families.
- For tax reasons, be careful with mutual funds.
  - Some funds are taxed *several* times, especially if they're foreign (e.g., Vanguard Total International Fund).

## 2. Price Appreciation

If you're young, consider investing a significant percentage of your portfolio to price appreciation.

  - Unless you're buying or selling them, they don't usually give returns.
  - More of a personal [insurance policy](money-insurance.md) than an investment vehicle.
