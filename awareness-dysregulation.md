# What dysregulation is

Dysregulation is a state where some of our body isn't responding to signals from other parts of our body.

- There are different types of dysregulation, with [emotional](mind-feelings.md) dysregulation being the highest-risk of becoming a chronic problem.
- We usually can't detect dysregulation directly, but can often see small behaviors in ourselves or others' reactions to us that allude to it.
- The only way to clear out dysregulation is to change and remove negative thoughts that have become [habits](habits.md).

There are multiple signs of dysregulation:

- Feeling spaced-out, at a loss for words, or unaware where you are.
- Feeling scattered, or trying to do many things and finishing nothing.
- Tripping over things, dropping things, or losing things.
- Flat voice or blank facial expression.
- Emotions are "too much" or out of line with what other people seem to feel.
- In a rage or severe sense of urgency to express what bothers you.
- Can't feel part of your body such as your hands, mouth, face, nose, or feet.

Dysregulation *does* have its time and place:

- Usually, we need to temporarily dysregulate to persevere through the ugly parts of [success](success-1_why.md) (especially if we experienced childhood [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md)).
- Spaced-out behavior and not feeling parts of your body makes unpleasant things easier to work through.
- Trying many things together can often [build connections](mind-creativity.md) that otherwise wouldn't be connected.
- Being clumsy or absent-minded can sometimes make boring experiences more interesting.
- A flat voice or blank facial expression prevents others from misusing your reactions, especially [in a conflict](people-5_conflicts.md).
- Extreme emotions, being in a rage, or a sense of urgency can frequently provoke others to act when they otherwise wouldn't.
- While [radical focus](success-4_routine.md) is necessary at times, it's absolutely critical for us to re-regulate, *especially* when we must [make critical decisions](decisions.md).

Like any other [substance](addiction-substances.md), dysregulation has addictive properties, specifically in how our feelings can be [certain](understanding-certainty.md) while everything around us isn't.
