This is a list of [intuitive](mind-feelings.md) needs for civilized, modern society (particularly the United States) you wouldn't otherwise know when you come from a poorer country or time-traveled here.

This isn't *always* the case, and if you're wealthy enough, you can often hire [specialists](jobs-specialization.md) who can take care of most of this for you. Otherwise, you'll suffer severe [financial losses](money-1_why.md), expose yourself to [unknowable risks](safety-riskmgmt.md), and be [legally unsafe](legal-safety.md).

## Hygiene

Make sure your [body odors](people-2_image.md) are at a minimum.

- Whatever you eat will make it into your body odor, so wash at least once a day.

## Marketing

The West is filled with [marketing](marketing.md) lies, but most people raised in it are immune to it.

- They've been fed [lies](people-lying.md) and [propaganda](stories-storytellers.md) since they were young, so most people are at least somewhat aware of most [image distortion methods](image-distortion.md).

## Contracts

Marketing lies are often *heavily* reinforced for the purpose of selling [debt](money-2_debt.md).

- Typically, they'll bind you into a predatory (but legal) [contract](people-6_contracts.md), though they'll never fully take away [your rights](people-boundaries.md).
- However, a few predatory contracts will create a debt-based situation that will function effectively like [indentured servitude](slavery.md).

No matter what, [stay legally safe](legal-safety.md) by only consenting to what you understand.

## Reputation


## What you must do

Legal

- *Always* keep your government-issued photo ID with you (i.e., driver's license, state ID, or passport).
- File your [yearly taxes](money-accounting.md), ideally by early February but *definitely* by April 15th.
- Honor the police's [authority](legal-safety.md), and never even *imply* you're bribing them.
- Have [liability insurance](money-insurance.md) for *all* your vehicles, keep the insurance card stored in the vehicle's glove box, and *only* drive within the conditions that qualify for your license (e.g., don't drive alone with a permit).

Communication

- Never trust the [marketing](marketing.md): everyone [lies](people-lying.md) and [distorts the truth](image-distortion.md) until you're [reading a contract](people-6_contracts.md).
- *Constantly* [update your address](home-moving.md) every time you move, or use a PO box when you can.
- Get a cell phone for texting, and constantly keep it active.
- Get an email address, and *never* lose the password.
- When moving across political barriers, make sure *all* the relevant government entities are informed (e.g., DMV, postal service) and adapt your [compliance](legal-safety.md) to the new region.

Skills

- Know [how to use a computer](computers.md).
- Maintain [hygiene](people-2_image.md) *every* day you're around other people.

## What you should do

Products

- Trust the public ratings over individual experience if the product is a commodity (e.g., [insurance](money-insurance.md), toilet paper, [autos](autos.md)).
- Trust smaller institutions and your personal experience for more specialized products.

Legal

- Understand the [legal doctrines](legal-doctrines.md) that frame the nation's laws.
- Distrust *any* [contract](people-6_contracts.md) you sign until it's been thoroughly explained to you.
  - If you still aren't sure and anything significant depends on it, get assistance interpreting it by a legal professional.
- Keep certain documentation locked away in a safe container somewhere:
  - Social security card
  - Titles to vehicles and real estate
- Have a network of experts for the variety of needs you may run across (e.g., [accounting](money-accounting.md), [insurance](money-insurance.md), [law](people-6_contracts.md), etc.).
- If you have money in collections, contact the source of the collections to pay them back to avoid a scam.

Communication

- If you don't speak the native language well, install a translation app on your phone or bookmarked on your phone's browser (e.g., Bing Translate, Google Translate).

Skills

- Keep your [automotive](autos.md) well-maintained.
- [Insure](money-insurance.md) everything of significant value (e.g., [auto](autos.md), [house](home-buy.md)).

## What you could do

Change your name or use a nickname.

- If you don't change your name, you risk typographical errors.
- If you *do* change your name legally, keep track of both the old and new name.
- In many contexts, the easiest solution is to simply use a nickname for daily interactions, and carefully spell out your legal name for official purposes.

Save records of all relevant correspondence.

- Record every important [business engagement](people-6_contracts.md) or [accident](safety-accidents.md) you experience (e.g., security camera, phone recordings, dashcam).
- Digitize all your documentation and keep it on secured cloud storage.

Use bank cards whenever possible, and have at least one bank account available for payments.

- In the USA, card payments are *more* ubiquitous than cash.
- If you have autopay, create a second account *only* for autopay expenses and transfer the [budgeted amount](money-3_budget.md) into it every month.

If you're a foreigner, request dual-citizenship, or get your new nation's citizenship outright and renounce your old one.

- The procedures for this can vary *heavily* by [political fashions](politics-systems.md), but it gives the stability of never risking deportation.

When possible, stay at least 2 years in the same living arrangement or job before making a large purchase.

- Most reports will look back between 6 months and 2 years.
- Too much [moving](home-moving.md) or [work shifts](jobs-1_why.md) may imply you have an unstable lifestyle.
