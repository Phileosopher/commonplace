"Gospel" simply means "good news", and that message in Christianity is extremely straightforward:

1. We have a [sin condition](morality-sins.md) we can't recover from, and our souls will die along with our bodies.
2. God made the Jewish Law to show us the state of our sin.
3. Jesus fulfilled that Law, then died for our sins as a perfect sacrifice.
4. Anyone who believes in that sacrifice won't die a second death.

## 1. Humanity sinned beyond hope

Non-Christian religion varies the scope and intensity of our sins, but *everyone* agrees that [sins](morality-sins.md) are somehow part of the [human condition](humanity.md).

The Judeo-Christian creation story explains where our sin condition began:

- The first man and woman were perfect and associated with God in the Garden of Eden ([Genesis 2](https://biblehub.com/bsb/genesis/2.htm)).
- They [implicitly trusted](trust.md) God so much that they didn't even know they were naked ([Genesis 3:7](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-7.htm)).
- The first man saw [the Satan](spiritual-warfare.md) tempt the first woman to defy God's order to not eat the fruit to know [morality](morality.md), then he followed.
- [God's perfect attributes](god.md) mean He can't coexist with imperfection, so He exiled them from the Garden.

Some people say the creation story is merely [symbolic](symbols.md), but its [mythological phenomenology](stories-myths.md) is still consistent with what we all know to be true.

Since that Fall, we've been cursed with sin:

- Women must endure extreme pain during childbearing and [want](purpose.md) to take over the man's role ([Genesis 3:16](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm)).
- Men must [work](results.md) very hard just to survive ([Genesis 3:17-19](https://biblehub.com/bsb/genesis/3.htm)).
- We've been exiled from God and have lost our connection with nature:
  - Most human experiences with God are deceptions.
  - We no longer have [authority](power.md) over other living organisms.
  - We don't even [connect well](people-4_friends.md) anymore with each other's [feelings](mind-feelings.md) and [thoughts](understanding.md)!

Beyond that, all humanity is cursed to die:

- At the moment they ate the fruit, [our spirits died](humanity-christian.md).
- The final consequence of sin is permanent, complete death ([Revelation 21:8](https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm)).
- It may feel [unfair](morality-justice.md) that we're reaping our ancestors' sins, but we'd *all* make the same stupid choice in their situation.
- If we had stayed in Eden and eaten the Tree of Life, we'd be stuck this way forever ([Genesis 3:22](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm)).

God made a promise, though, that the Satan would be struck down later ([Genesis 3:15](https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm)).

## 2. The Jewish Law shows us our sin

The Law shows we can't rebuild back to God's presence:

- Judaism gives hundreds of [clearly defined laws](rules.md) to follow in the daily life of the time (most of [Exodus](https://biblehub.com/bsb/exodus/19.htm), [Leviticus](https://biblehub.com/bsb/leviticus/1.htm), [Numbers](https://biblehub.com/bsb/numbers/1.htm), and [Deuteronomy](https://biblehub.com/bsb/deuteronomy/1.htm)).
- God requires us to do *all* of them ([Leviticus 19:2](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-2.htm), [Matthew 5:28](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm), [Romans 3:23](https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm)).
- Even if we fully wanted to, we're so habituated to our [culture](people-culture.md) and its [sins](people-culture.md) that following all the laws is humanly impossible.

Violating only one law condemns a person to eternal destruction in hell ([Ezekiel 18:20](https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm), [Matthew 10:28](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm)).

Some people claim there is no hell, it's not eternal, or that we'll only cease to exist, but the Bible makes it abundantly clear that hell is a real, eternal place ([Isaiah 64:6](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-6.htm), [Matthew 13:41-42](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/13.htm), [Luke 13:24-28](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/13.htm)).

The Jewish Prophets also prophesy a Messiah who will establish a new arrangement ([Jeremiah 31:31-34](https://biblehub.com/bsb/jeremiah/31.htm)).

- The word "gospel" itself draws from a Hebrew doctrine indicating that humanity needs saving.

## 3. Jesus fulfilled the Jewish Law

The Messiah had to [fulfill every prophecy](jesus-prophecies.md) while on earth ([Psalm 40:7](https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm), [Luke 24:44](https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm), [Revelation 19:10](https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm)).

Even beyond the Bible, Jesus' existence was unique:

1. Jesus died by [public crucifixion](rules-methods.md), but they still haven't found a body, even though the most [powerful](power.md) military unit at the time was stationed to protect it.
2. After Jesus' crucifixion, his disciples and other followers had legitimate experiences of seeing Jesus.
   - If it was a cleverly designed [hoax](people-lying.md), *every* follower of Jesus believed they were real events, including high-ranking officials and tradesmen.
   - Jesus' biological brother, James, had an experience he thought was a separate appearance of Jesus.
   - These people were driven by their experiences to leave their jobs to deliver his message.
   - Paul, a prominent Pharisee with *nothing* to gain from following Jesus, experienced what he [believed](understanding-certainty.md) was Jesus appearing, then converted to Christianity.
3. Within 1-2 years after Jesus died, thousands of people were following Jesus and preaching his story.
   - If Jesus was a successful [scammer](image-distortion.md) or magician, the hype would have died with him, or at least would have mostly died out.
   - Against all attempts to destroy or revise [the Bible](bible.md) for 2,000 years, it keeps carrying on that same message across all languages and cultures.

By fulfilling the Law as a human being, any person who believes in Jesus won't have to live by the Law anymore if they believe and follow Him ([Matthew 5:17](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm)).

## 4. Repent and believe

God promises that after this life, believers will go to heaven ([Jo](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/jhn.3.16)[h](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm)[n 3:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/jhn.3.16), [Romans 5:10](https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm), [1 John 4:9-10](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_john/4.htm)) and nonbelievers will go to hell ([Revelation 20:11-15](https://biblehub.com/bsb/revelation/20.htm)).

Salvation is a complex experience:

- Declare Jesus is the Lord and [believe](understanding-certainty.md) He died for your sins to receive salvation (Romans 10:9), which has several components:
  1. Believe in God's existence.
  2. Believe Jesus is the Lord of everything, which is essentially declaring that Jesus is God.
  3. Believe Jesus is *your* Lord, a form of fealty and submission.
  4. Believe that Jesus legitimately died, which means that Jesus had to have become a man.
  5. Believe God (specifically, Jesus' "Father") raised Jesus from the dead, which means that the definition of "God" isn't so straightforward (i.e., discussions regarding believing the [Trinity](god.md)).
- Some Christians say purgatory will sort out sins that aren't confessed, but the passage is vague enough to refer to the spiritually dead on this earth, and in a book some Christians declare non-canonical ([2 Maccabees 12:39-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Maccabees+12%3A39-46&version=DRA)).
- The final salvation, however, is at the Great White Throne Judgment, where all sins will be eradicated with the people found guilty of them ([Revelation 20:11-15](https://biblehub.com/bsb/revelation/20.htm)).

God promises much more than merely heaven and escape from hell:

Jesus promises an abundant remaining life on this earth ([John 10:10](https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm)).

All Christians receive the [gift](spiritual-gifts.md) of the Holy Spirit ([1 Corinthians 3:16](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm), [1 Corinthians 12:13](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm)).

Following Jesus is a living, dynamic relationship with the one true God ([Romans 8:31-39](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/8.htm)).

God [promises](people-contracts.md) believers will receive an incorruptible and eternal crown of glory ([1 Corinthians 9:24-25](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/9.htm), [2 Timothy 4:8](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm)).

- This crown might be others brought to Christ through your testimony ([1 Thessalonians 2:19-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_thessalonians/2.htm)).

Some Christians add that salvation requires effort beyond merely believing:

- It *is* certainly true that simply believing and not acting isn't really "belief", but our merit or effort doesn't determine who Jesus saves.
- Baptism is a [symbolic](symbols.md) act of devotion and not a condition for salvation ([1 Peter 3:21](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm)).
- [Praying](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md) a specific prayer shows commitment, but only through our [sincerity](understanding-certainty.md) in praying it.
- Other activities like communion/Eucharist and honoring the Sabbath pertain to your [relationship with God](identity.md) and [communal experience](church.md), but have nothing to do with attaining salvation.
- Speaking in tongues and baptism in the Holy Spirit are [part of God's work in us](spiritual-gifts.md), but they're not salvation ([1 Corinthians 14](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/14.htm)).

In response to your [faith](understanding-certainty.md) in Jesus, God will make you a [new creation](identity.md), which *will* permanently [change](people-changes.md) you.
