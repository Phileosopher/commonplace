Dealing with the [unknown](/unknown/) is vastly difficult, so we tend to find [meaning](/meaning/) in declaring things to be certain.

[We must constantly trust](/trust/) everything around us, but we make [decisions](/decisions/) to prioritize trusting one thing over another.

We "believe" when we consider something to be [reality](/reality/), even without direct evidence.

- We all believe (i.e., implicitly trust) we'll have enough food for our next meal.
- If you have a job, you believe you'll have it tomorrow.
- You believe you will wake up tomorrow morning.

Beliefs are how we establish things when we can't really know but believe we ought to, which is almost every time we have no [direct control](/results/) over something but still must make [decisions](/decisions/).

We start to believe when we [value](/decisions/) one thing as [true](/reality/) over another thing. As children, we start with 100% certainty about various things, but our beliefs become a spectrum as we gain [understanding](/understanding/):

1. A [deterrence](/safety/)-based [fear](/fear/) of worse alternatives.
2. A broad belief that we [understand](/understanding/) something far enough that it's very likely.
3. Believing the thing enough to [rely on](/decisions/).
4. Concluding the thing is [indisputable](/conflicts-inner/).
5. [Identifying](/identity/) close enough with the thing to act boldly and publicly about it, even to the point of [confrontation](/boundaries/).

A giant portion of what we believe in comes through the [authority](/trust/) we hold our beliefs on:

- If an authority is physically present, we can only trust it as far as [reality](/reality/) and [consequences](/results/) hold up.
- Holding to the authority of the ideas themselves is a strictly [philosophical](/philosophy/) justification.
- We end up believing ideas based on other ideas, which usually goes back to one of our [impressions](/image/) or [cultural teaching](/culture/).

We can only know a small set of facts without needing *any* belief:

1. By [thinking](/understanding/) at all, you prove that you are a thinking thing.
2. [Pain](/fear/), in whatever form it takes, is real.
3. [Feelings](/feelings/) exist, in whatever form they express as.

Everything else, from the idea of a [perfect circle](/math/) to what we understand behind others' [language](/language/), has degrees of uncertainty that we gloss over with [habitual](/habits/) [expectations](/imagination/):

Both fools *and* wise people become more certain as they gain [understanding](/understanding/). The major difference is the scope of where they claim that certainty. Wise people claim certainty on specific things and expand outward, while fools start with a broad claim that applies to many more things than it should.

We make [commitments](/purpose/) and [predictions](/imagination/) about what we are certain of. Those commitments and predictions (and how well we [follow through with them](/results/)) demonstrate our true beliefs, [contrary to what we claim we believe](/image/).

- You expect a noise when you turn the key in your car.
- The screen on your phone responds when you touch it.
- People say something back when you say, "hello".

## Bad information

Belief is a product of a functioning mind, but many things can betray our trust. We're often [deceived](/image-distortion/) or under-informed, people betray us, and we [miscalculate](/math/).

While we misjudge all the time, we tend to fix misunderstandings immediately, and the self-correcting nature of our minds generally tends to fix those misunderstandings without our knowledge.

Occasionally, we'll place our trust in a bad idea. When that happens, we'll often get "stuck" on it, and will substantiate it with various hard-to-disprove reasons:

- [Conceit or hubris](/evil/) about [reputation](/image/) or [knowledge](/understanding/).
- Believing a group's [promises](/boundaries/) that they can solve our [issues](/purpose/).
- [Addictions](/addiction/) that ravage our ability to [think rationally](/logic/) from [over-identifying](/identity/) with it.
- Trusting in the unverifiable unknown, such as in many [cults and religions](/religion/).
- Belief in [statistics](/math/) or, on the other end, statistical *unlikelihood* (i.e., luck).

One of the methods that locks us into wrong beliefs is hypnosis, which is any repetitive action that reaffirms on a subconscious thought. By repeating something over and over (e.g., a mantra), we start believing things as if we [understood](/understanding/) them, even when we don't. The more specific, the more we can [feel](/feelings/) it, and the more potent it becomes.

Generally, uncertainty takes more work to maintain as [understanding](/understanding/), while on the other hand, *[acting](/creations/)* with certainty takes more work to [perform](/results/).

## Decisions

Despite this shoddy framework of information, we still must make [decisions](/decisions/) with that information.

We can only trust things that we see as the same or better than other things. Since we [understand ourselves](https://adequate.life/awareness/) more than anyone else, we use our self-perception as the starting point for practically everything else.

Over our lives, we start creating a [purpose](/purpose/)-based hierarchy of what we can trust:

- A person will trust their spouse more than anyone else, but will trust themselves over their spouse on [trade-specific knowledge](/specialization-cities/).
- A lawyer is trustworthy to manage a legal situation, but not necessarily on [moral](/morality/) matters.
- Typically, strangers have more things someone can't know than friends, even if their intentions aren't as clear.

We decide with a conviction proportional to the clarity of our [understanding](/understanding/). To [actually create results](/results/), we must stop thinking about the matter at some point to avoid constantly second-guessing ourselves.

We don't always remember what we learned and its context, so we trust much of what we do from experience:

- If a chair breaks, it's an unlikely event, so we find another chair.
- A mother sometimes fails a child's expectations, but the child still trusts their mother because of other things that were good.
- If someone loses a job, they'll look for another one because they've perceived other people who had jobs that fulfilled their [purposes](/purpose/).

## Crisis of faith

Occasionally, we make bad decisions we think are good. We'll invest a *ton* of [resources](/power/) toward them, but won't get the [results](/results/) we were expecting. This is *completely* irrespective of how well we've [reasoned](/logic/), and comes mostly from [applying experience](/understanding/).

We suffer a type of cognitive dissonance where we trust two incompatible things at once. A crisis of faith is when we become aware of that conflict because an [expectation](/imagination/) failed with the one that we trusted more.

We tend to have an [inner conflict](/conflicts-inner/), but many people with [trauma](/ptsd/) will [mix their trauma into what they believe about others' lives](/boundaries/). Some political systems [take advantage of this](/leftism/).

Eventually, a person must decide: accept what they perceive, or believe something is "testing" their faith. Either way, they're rebuilding their [story](/stories/), either by changing the [logical](/logic/) conclusion (aka "changing their mind") or adding/removing premises.

When our faith is tested, but we still hold on, we call that "hope". There's a fine line between [sensible](/logic/) hope and blind hope.

If that person starts denying reality to "prove" something, they're removing premises. Once this becomes [habitual](/habits/), they will resort to magical thinking, which is interpreting the world to be what they [imagine](/imagination/) instead of [what it is](/reality/). Magical thinkers tend to share a few traits:

- They trust their preconceived beliefs and their [affiliated groups](/groups-member/) more than the perceptions.
- They believe reality is dictated more by [saying](/language/) and [doing](/decisions/) specific things than from [cause-and-effect](/results/).
- If something is outside their [understanding](/understanding/), it doesn't exist or must be purged.
- In their [conflicts with others](/boundaries/), they presume they're 100% correct, and will often shift their thoughts if they've been [logically](/logic/) convinced.

If we choose to listen to the [feeling](/feelings/) of distrust, we'll disbelieve what we were [trained](/understanding/). We'll enter a type of "agnosis", where we'll live in disbelief about a broad range of related concepts. It can sometimes span a subject, but other times can possess everything we've *ever* known.

Since we trust our [habits of thought and action](/habits/), the only cure to prevent a crisis of faith from even starting is to continually [revisit old habits](https://adequate.life/change/) and [beliefs](https://adequate.life/awareness/).

## Application

We *must* believe things when we're not fully certain. The volatile nature of life means [leaders](/groups-small/) and [artists](/creativity/) venture into less certain places than the rest of society. So, [influence](/influence/) loosely correlates with the ability to trust.

Everyone, even [leaders](/groups-small/), are subject to changing their views. This can create large-scale consequences for everyone, especially if it's changing a [core view](/philosophy/).

Conviction requires focus, so smarter people (who can often see complexities) are often lousy at sticking to convictions, which often makes them terrible leaders.

The only way we can prepare our minds for maximum [understanding](/understanding/) is by opening it up to *all* possibilities. While it's uncomfortable, all we have to do is convert every inner statement into a question to create an [inner conflict](/conflicts-inner/) about it.

Hypnosis is all around us (especially through our [past trauma](/ptsd/), [public media](/creations/), and [politics](/leftism/)), but we can use it for our [purposes](/purpose/). By repeating something specific, we can channel our subconscious (e.g., "I will find a new job by the end of March."). It's [the secret to most success](https://adequate.life/success-2/).

Magical thinking exists proportionally to how self-trusting someone is, which frequently comes with intelligence. Thus, there are *tons* of magical thinkers in fields with intelligent people like [politics](/groups-large/), [academia](/understanding/), and [computer programming](https://trendless.tech) who won't acknowledge additional elements of [reality](/reality/) that they can't [know](/understanding/):

- Many doctors believe the body's healing processes to be strictly mechanical and often neglect the psychosomatic [power](/power/) we possess through our [happiness](https://adequate.life/happiness-1/) and beliefs.
- Most scientists are religiously [atheist](/religion/), but claim to be non-religious.
- When large groups have a [procedure or policy](/results/) they deem necessary, they'll become [corrupted](/bad-systems/) while trying to maintain it.

Hope is based around a [purpose](/purpose/), so if someone feels hopeless, they're failing to see how a thing can accomplish a purpose. Understanding that purpose is key to understanding if something *is* hopeless.

To find someone's actual opinion, ask for their advice for [resolving a problem](https://notageni.us/fix/), or what they think everyone else believes.

[MLM](https://notageni.us/mlm/), gambling, and lotteries [appear](/image/) to be ubiquitous because people are deceived into expecting tremendous wealth. In reality, they engage in those things because they *hope* for tremendous wealth from those things, and find [meaning](/meaning/) in a journey that's rarely fulfilled.

While extremists are typically the most outspoken people of a [group](/groups-member/), they often don't [understand](/understanding/) the thing they're [promoting](https://notageni.us/marketing/). They're typically acting off [trauma](/ptsd/) and magical thinking, but devout believers in a thing don't really *need* to convince others to [feel](/feelings/) the thing is [true](/reality/). Disagree with them and closely observe [what they disagree over](/boundaries/).

It's extremely difficult to change a person's opinions. The only way to do this is to [influence](/influence/) them with a compelling [story](/stories/) about an alternative opinion, then wait.
