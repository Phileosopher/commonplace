[Note-taking 101: from Evernote to Obsidian - CoCoSys lab](https://anneurai.net/2021/03/16/note-taking-101-from-evernote-to-obsidian/)
- markdown-based note-taking is, by far, THE best way to take notes
- anything else out there is essentially adding extra complexities beyond what normal people need
- however, it's also useful for DRM by the owner of the notes system
- of course, it can't be the ONLY note system:
	- 2D data - spreadsheet
	- 3D+ data - proper database
	- visual design - drawing/art/graphics software
	- mindmap - visual/data visualization software

Technical documentation is VITALLY important
- instead of answering questions all day, a developer can simply communicate that in writing and point people to that
- most Tier 1/2 helpdesk tech support(TTfixing) will be dramatically improved by good documentation, even if the users are too dense to understand
