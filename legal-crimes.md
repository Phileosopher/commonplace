# A list of crimes, categorized by type

NOTE: This is highly contextual to [social norms](people-rules.md):

- *Anything* done against others' wishes, especially without [love](people-love.md), is likely (or ought to be) a crime.
- Nearly everything *isn't* a crime, however, if someone had [consented](people-contracts.md) to it, even implicitly.
- These [boundaries](people-boundaries-why.md) can become more clear if a government requires some sort of certification or permit (e.g., an underground fight club versus an exhibition MMA match).

Further, there are several types of categories connected to the severity of the crime:

- Minor offense: things below a misdemeanor

- Felony: generally, any crime with a maximum sentencing surpassing a year
- White-collar crime: a more complex crime that is subversive in nature and typically involves more money, often carries much more significant legal consequences
  - Public corruption: actions that give preferential treatment through the government
