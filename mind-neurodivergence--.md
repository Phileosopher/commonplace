one of the sad realities of cluster b is that they do not learn from their mistakes
- it's a side effect of always working hard to be blameless
- they do take advantage of people, but don't learn
- over time, it becomes clear as they grow more bitter and less malleable to conform an image, and less able to use their (first physical, then mental) faculties for manipulation

## narcissist arguments

most people argue to prove a point or defend a perspective

narcissists argue to capture your attention
- it feeds their supply

ways to brick a narcissist:
- ask them what their greatest regret is
- ask them where they get their authority from
- call them out on a lie, then assert in so many words that it doesn't matter what you think
