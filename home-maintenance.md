# How to maintain a home

Upkeep of a house simply involves making steady, consistent [decorations and renovations](home-decorations.md), along with repairs.

- Prioritize survival-based and structural needs (e.g., roof, plumbing) over conveniences (e.g., internet) or luxury/cosmetic (e.g., carpet, smart doorbell).
- If it's a nice house, your work is relatively easy, but homes in disrepair will need *many* projects until you can feel comfortable.
- Make sure to [set reasonable goals](success-3_goals.md) and pace it according to your [budget](money-3_budget.md) and [time](success-4_routine.md).

Try to [address](https://adequate.life/fix/) small problems *before* they become large ones.

- Most of the problems will revolve around water, in the bathroom and the kitchen.
- Sewage plumbing blockage is comparatively easier to fix when you have *some* running water through it (e.g., using a drain cleaner).
  - If your plumbing system becomes unpredictable, either flush the toilet paper on a second flush or place it in a trash can.
- Electrical shorts are less miserable to fix than blackouts.
- Fix most leaks as soon as you know of them, which typically comes from old roofing or an insufficient drainage system.

The maintenance of your home will add to the [quality of your life](goodlife.md), provide [meaning](meaning.md), and can be a significant [investment return](money-investing.md) when you choose to sell it.

- Carpentry requires a steady hand, but is typically *much* more affordable and customizable than paying for work if you become skilled at it, especially furniture and finish carpentry.
- Masonry and stonework is simple enough to do, if you have the strength for it.
- [Pet](fun-pets.md) projects often give extra opportunities to have fun with your pet.
- Custom shelves and built-in organization can *dramatically* help with [organization](organization.md).
- Greenhouses can help with [gardening](horticulture.md).
- Projects that improve life for [children](parenting-children.md) (e.g., treehouses, swing sets) can profoundly improve on their childhood.
- Building a workshop can make *all* the above, as well as [fixing](https://adequate.life/fix/), much easier.
