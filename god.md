# Who God is

Some of God's qualities are explicitly defined in [the Bible](bible.md), and can only be true, without room for philosophical [speculation](imagination.md).

- That doesn't mean we can't take guesses at many other components of God, but it does mean there are certain constants.

Even without [the Bible](bible.md), we can still [logically](logic.md) conclude God's existence through induction.

- Kalam argument: Everything started with something, so God is that something that started everything.
- Liebniz argument: Everything has an explanation for it, so God explains the universe's existence.
- Fine-Tuning argument: The universe is highly ordered and necessary for [life](science.md) to exist, so something must have fine-tuned it, and it's absurd to presume it came from pure randomness.
- Moral argument: [morality](morality.md) requires God to exist, and morals do exist, so God exists (which happens to also nullify the Evil God Challenge).
- Ontological argument: There's something that's the "greatest" to compare everything to, and that's God.

## God is a mystery

God is unlike any other being in our experience:

- [Psalm 113:5-6](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/113.htm)
- [Isaiah 55:8-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/isaiah/55.htm)
- [Isaiah 57:15](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm)
- [John 8:23](https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm)

We [understand](understanding.md) God through theology (i.e., "knowledge of God").

- God has an eternal and infinite nature, so we need a decent capacity for [philosophy](philosophy.md) to [understand His viewpoint](https://theologos.site/god-sight/).
  - To be clear, though, we do *not* need to understand his view to [have a relationship with Him](jesus-gospel.md) ([Matthew 11:25](https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm))
- We can partially [understand](understanding.md) God, but won't be able to fully understand Him in this life ([1 Corinthians 13:9-12](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm)).
- Thankfully, there are no intellectual barriers to [loving people](church-serve.md), meaning everyone can act in awareness of God.

## God is forever the same

God has a few frequently used names:

- Elohim
  - "El" means "strength" or "strong one", and "ohim" comes from "Alah", meaning to bind oneself by an [oath](contracts.md).
  - Altogether, it most clearly relates to "reverence".
- YHWH or Yahweh
  - The Jews felt God's name was too sacred to pronounce with vowels, so we don't know how it would sound (e.g., "Yehwah", "Ayohuweho").
- Adonai, which means "lord, master, or husband".

God is self-existing:

- [Exodus 3:14](https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm)
- [Psalm 90:2](https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm)
- [John 1:1-5](https://biblehub.com/bsb/john/1.htm)
- [John 5:26](https://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm)
- [Colossians 1:15-17](https://biblehub.com/bsb/colossians/1.htm)

God is eternal:

- [Psalm 102:12](https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-12.htm)
-[Hebrews 13:8](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm)

- While we can understand infinity as a concept of time, eternity is entirely removed from time.

God doesn't change, even from outside influences:

- [Malachi 3:6](https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-6.htm)
- [James 1:17](https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm)
- God's unchanging nature, however, is a tricky discussion with respect to the person of Jesus (see below).

## God is love

God's attributes literally *define* love:

- [Deuteronomy 7:7-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/deuteronomy/7.htm)
- [John 14:31](https://biblehub.com/john/14-31.htm)

- [Ephesians 4:7](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-7.htm)
- [Hebrews 4:16](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm)

God is nearby and actively involved:

- [Jeremiah 23:23-24](https://biblehub.com/bsb/jeremiah/23.htm)
- [Acts 17:27-28](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/17.htm)
- [Haggai 2:5](https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-5.htm)

## Only God has the right and ability to deliver judgment

God is holy, which means perfectly pure:

- [Exodus 3:5-6](https://biblehub.com/bsb/exodus/3.htm)
- [1 Samuel 2:2](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_samuel/2.htm)
- [Psalm 99:2-3](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/99.htm)
- [Isaiah 6:3](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm)
- [Revelation 4:8](https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm)

God is righteous, which is holiness applied to [action](mind-creativity-results.md):

- [Genesis 18:25](https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm)
- [Psalm 19:7-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/19.htm)
- [Psalm 145:17](https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-17.htm)
- [Jeremiah 9:24](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-24.htm)

God [knows](understanding.md) everything:

- [Ezekiel 11:5](https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-5.htm)
- [Psalm 147:5](https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-5.htm)
- [Acts 15:18](https://biblehub.com/acts/15-18.htm)
- [Romans 2:6](https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm)
- [Romans 11:33](https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm)
- [Hebrews 4:13](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm)
- [1 John 3:20](https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm)

God is fair and [just](morality-justice.md):

- [Genesis 18:25](https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-25.htm)
[Exodus 34:6-7](https://biblehub.com/bsb/exodus/34.htm)
- [Nehemiah 9:32-33](https://biblehub.com/bsb/nehemiah/9.htm)
- [Psalm 99:4](https://biblehub.com/psalms/99-4.htm)
- [Romans 1:32](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm)
- [Romans 9:14-33](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/9.htm)
- [1 Peter 1:17](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-17.htm)

God is merciful:

- [Psalm 6:4](https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-4.htm)
- [Romans 9:23-24](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/9.htm)
- [Ephesians 2:4](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-4.htm)
- [Titus 3:5](https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm)
- [Hebrews 4:16](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm)
- [1 Peter 1:3](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm)

God is [all-powerful](power.md):

- [Psalm 115:3](https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm)
- [Jeremiah 32:17](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-17.htm)
- [Matthew 19:26](https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-26.htm)
- [Mark 14:36](https://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm)
- [Romans 11:36](https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm)
- [Ephesians 1:11](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm)
- [Hebrews 1:3](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm)

God is all-present:

- [1 Kings 8:27](https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-27.htm)
- [Job 11:7-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/job/11.htm)
- [Psalm 90:1-2](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/90.htm)
- [Psalm 139:7-10](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/139.htm)
- [Jeremiah 23:23-24](https://biblehub.com/bsb/jeremiah/23.htm)
- God isn't necessarily *in* everything, but He certainly can be anywhere He wants.

## God's characteristics and actions are *not* the same

God can certainly be wrathful, but only as a response to [evil](morality-evil.md).

Relative to us, He has many roles:

- King of kings and Lord of lords
  - [Deuteronomy 10:17](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm)
  - [1 Timothy 6:15](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm)
  - [Revelation 19:16](https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm)
- The Great Physician
  - [Psalm 103:3](https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm)
  - [Matthew 14:14](https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-14.htm)
  - [James 5:16](https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm)
- The Great Lawyer
  - [Isaiah 40:8](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm)
  - [Matthew 5:18](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm)
  - [Luke 16:17](https://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm)
- The Great Teacher
  - [Job 35:11](https://biblehub.com/job/35-11.htm)
  - [1 Corinthians 1:27](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm)
- The Great Artist
  - [Job 37:14-16](https://biblehub.com/bsb/job/37.htm)
  - [Psalm 96:11-12](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/96.htm)
  - [Ecclesiastes 3:11](https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm)
- The Great Recordkeeper
  - [2 Samuel 14:11](https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-11.htm)
  - [Luke 21:28](https://biblehub.com/luke/21-28.htm)
- A Consuming Fire
  - [Hebrews 12:29](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm)
  - [Deuteronomy 4:24](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-24.htm)

## Jesus is God

Jesus consistently claimed to be equal with God using an intentionally concealed tone:

- [John 8:58](https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm)
- [Mark 2:1-12](https://biblehub.com/bsb/mark/2.htm)
- [Mark 2:28](https://biblehub.com/mark/2-28.htm)
- [Mark 14:60-64](https://biblehub.com/bsb/mark/14.htm)

Jesus is also, however, fully man:

- [Matthew 16:3](https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-3.htm)
- [Matthew 20:28](https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm)

Like the Trinity, it's difficult for us to understand how Jesus is 100% man and 100% equal with God.

- He couldn't have risen from the dead or done miracles if He didn't have God's power.
- He couldn't have legitimately died if He wasn't a man.
- *We're* obviously not God, so it requires more [philosophical](philosophy.md) [analysis](logic.md).

[Jesus' *entire message*](jesus-gospel.md) requires people to take His divine humanity as a literal concept, so Christians in this life will always be stuck with a paradox of [understanding](understanding.md).

There is no direct significance about the name "Jesus" or "Jesus Christ".

- The modern styling would be "Josh the Savior".
  - Many Jewish people were called Jesus up to the second century AD, and it should more accurately be phrased "Yeshua", borrowed from "Joshua".
  - The word "Joshua" was contracted from "Jehoshua", which meant "Jehovah the Savior".
  - "Christ" simply means "Messiah" or "Savior", which describes His role.
- Calling Him "Lord" is a far more pronounced reality, since the [power dynamic](power.md) is extremely discrepant.
- He goes by *many* other names, and here are a few examples:
  - Branch ([Isaiah 11:1](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm))
  - Banner for People ([Isaiah 11:10](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm))
  - Desire of All Nations ([Haggai 2:7](https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm))
  - Peacemaker (Shiloh) ([Genesis 49:10](https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm))
  - Prophet ([Deuteronomy 18:15](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm))
  - Redeemer ([Psalm 19:14](https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm))
  - Savior ([Acts 5:3](https://biblehub.com/acts/5-3.htm))
- Calling on His name has significance ([Romans 10:13](https://biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm), [Joel 2:32](https://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm))
  - However, the meaning *behind* calling on the name of Jesus is far more significant than the name itself.

## God is a Trinity of three persons

God is a Father, a Son, and a Spirit

- [Matthew 12:31](https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-31.htm)
- [John 16:3](https://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm)
- [John 16:8](https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm)
- [Acts 5:3](https://biblehub.com/acts/5-3.htm)
- [Acts 7:51](https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm)
- [Acts 8:39](https://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm)
- [Acts 10:19-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/10.htm)
- [Romans 8:26-27](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/8.htm)
- [1 Corinthians 2:10-11](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/2.htm)
- [1 Corinthians 12:11](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm)
- [Ephesians 4:30](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-30.htm)
- [Hebrews 10:29](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm)

At least two persons of God (the Father and Son) are distinctly male.

- Some metaphors express female attributes, but *very* rarely:
  - [Matthew 23:37](https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm)
  - [Luke 15](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/15.htm)

God is One, but also three unique people who are all the same God

- [Matthew 28:19](https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm)
- [Luke 1:35](https://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm)
- [John 14:16-17](https://biblehub.com/john/14.htm)
- [John 14:23](https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm)

The Trinity involves three highly interconnected relationships that closely resemble a [family](church-family.md), but more intimately than we're capable of imagining.

- [Love](people-love.md) always requires a giver and receiver, and the Trinity makes Him the only being that can love as both essence *and* action.

### One of our most difficult challenges is understanding the Trinity

The Bible clearly shows separate divine relationships.

Jesus is distinctly different from God:

- ([John 1:1](https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm)
- [John 1:14](https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm)
- [John 4:25-26](https://biblehub.com/bsb/john/4.htm)
- [John 8:24](https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm)
- [John 10:30](https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm)
- [1 John 5:7](https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm)).

At the same time, Jesus is the same as God:

- [Isaiah 7:14](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm)
- [Luke 2:21](https://biblehub.com/luke/2-21.htm)
- [Colossians 2:9-10](https://biblehub.com/bsb/colossians/2.htm)
- [Hebrews 1:8](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm)
- [1 Timothy 3:16](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm)

Jesus and the Holy Spirit are distinctly different:

- ([Matthew 1:20](https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm)
- [Romans 8:9](https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm)

The Father and the Holy Spirit are distinctly different:

- [John 14:26](https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm)
- [John 15:26](https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm)
- [1 Corinthians 2:10](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm))

In short:

- The Father isn't the Son or Holy Spirit.
- The Son isn't the Father or the Holy Spirit.
- The Holy Spirit isn't the Father or the Son.
- But, all three are irreducibly God.

We don't have any decent comparisons to the Trinity:

- Water (solid, liquid, and gas) or light (primary colors that add to make white) fail in their analogy because external conditions define their form.
- Our [body, soul, and spirit](people-spiritual.md) can somewhat compare, but our essence is still all contained entirely within the same being.

With God being a Trinity, by [deduction](logic.md) each Person will have a different [perspective](image.md), each with at least a slightly different [understanding](understanding.md) of something:

- [Matthew 24:36](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm)
- [John 6:38](https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm)

The presence of a Trinity is the only logical way many things can happen within Christianity.

- Jesus can't pray to the Father in any meaningful way without having some degree of difference from the Father.
- We can't live to be like Jesus if Jesus isn't human.
- The Father can't deliver judgment fairly if He's a finite human.
- The arguments for the existence of God can prove the Father's existence, but they don't necessarily prove anything about Jesus.
- Without the Son possessing at least some scarcity of information while also being God, then God wouldn't need to respond to human changes.
  - Without changes, there is effectively no [free will](decisions.md) because God is simply acting out a predetermined script.
  - There is no [legitimate relationship with God whatsoever](identity-christian.md) without a God who can respond to us in some capacity.
- Jesus has been described as the firstborn of all creation ([Colossians 1:15](https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm)), and the Trinity makes it possible for God to always exist while also deciding to change for the sake of His creation.

## We can't know everything about God

God created us in His [image](image.md), but we aren't God:

- [Genesis 1:27](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/gen.1.27)

Our finite nature means we can't fully understand Him:

- [Psalm 103:15--16](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/psa.103)

## We can also know what God *can't* be

God isn't "tame" or weak.

God isn't [self-contradicting](logic.md), petty, or fickle.

God isn't [conventional](habits.md) or [predictable](imagination.md).

God isn't simply a cosmic energy or "in all of us".
