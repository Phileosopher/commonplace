### b tracking progress - customer opinion

REDDIT COMMENT
Computer engineer here. We ship so many products that have broken features. The product is fused at the factory to disable features that just didn't bake fully before we needed to ship. Every product I ever worked on has a half dozen bugs that we could have fixed if only we had more time and money.
Eventually you have to say "it's good enough" and ship something to make money.
watched a video on semiconductor manufacturing and was shocked to learn that all the processors in the same generation are actually physically the same, it just comes down to how many defects there were at the end of manufacturing. so i5, i7, i9 intel cpus from the same generation are actually all the same prints, i9 just had more functional cores when tested after production.
edit: the video relevant section like 23 mins in, but whole thing's worth a watch
Years ago AMD released some tri core processors. Those were just quad core processors with a defect. They were priced very favorably so eventually they ran out of ‘em as they became very popular and well selling. Eventually they took perfectly functional quad cores and loaded them up with firmware that simply disabled the fourth core. By flashing them firmware for a quad core you could unlock the fourth core.
Later, one or two generations later, they would destroy the fourth core with a laser or something.

- transparency is VERY critical, even more than normal, when there's craptons of technology recording everything everywhere all the time

### giving away things
