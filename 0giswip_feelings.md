At our core, beyond [reasoning or sensibility](/logic/), we experience the world around us through emotions. These feelings are the same base feelings as any other mammal, though they express differently.

## Basis

Biochemically, a feeling is a hormone reaction triggered by a response to environmental stimuli based on a particular [belief](/values/) synthesized through [experience](/imagination/). This stimulus can come from our [perceptions](/image/), or simply from our physical state. These feelings provoke impulses that drive our [decisions](/decisions/) and [purposes](/purpose/).

In one sense, feelings are a status indicator of what we generally [understand](/understanding/) is happening. But, in another sense, feelings are low-level forms of [logic](/logic/), but framed on reactionary premises we [trust](/trust/) instead of well-formed ones that may be harder to quickly [identify](/image/).

Our impulses also form into thoughts of their own, which can also trigger our beliefs as we think them, meaning we can feel things from noticing our feelings. All of it is even messier because our [beliefs](/certainty/) only have a loose relationship to [reasoning](/logic/) or [reality](/reality/).

Even analytical, [logical](/logic/) people are bound by their feelings, though they're often [afraid](/fear/) of their feelings guiding them.

All feelings are driven from either a core belief that's either a [love](/love/) or [fear](/fear/) of something, and they represent in relationship to fulfilling one of six basic needs in an approximate progressive order:

1. [Certainty](/certainty/) - assurance you can avoid pain or gain pleasure
2. [Uncertainty or Variety](/unknown/) - the need for new experiences
3. [Significance](/meaning/) - the need to feel important, special, or needed
4. [Connection or Love](/love/) - feeling closeness or united with something
5. [Growth](/change/) - extending [ability](/results/) or [understanding](/understanding/)
6. Contribution - [helping others](https://theologos.site/serve/) in some capacity

The need fulfillment (and its associated feelings) work through our needs in pairs:

- We first look for certainty (to feel [safe](/safety/)), then uncertainty (to feel a sense of adventure).
- Then, we look for significance to feel we matter (what we do), but at the same time see love and acceptance (who we are).
- Finally, we look to grow (inward development) and contribute (outward development).

Feelings are inherently social, and our [connections with others](/friendship/), starting with our [parenting](/family/), define how much we feel others' feelings.

## Bias

Feelings create [bias](/bias/), and we tend to call things that are heavy with feelings "personal experiences". So-called "personal experience" makes us very prone to [deceiving](/image-distortion/) ourselves in many directions. When we experience [trauma](/ptsd/), we have feelings we're [unaware](https://adequate.life/awareness/) of that profoundly affect our lives long after the events have passed.

We can discipline ourselves to focus on [reality](/reality/) more, but have no direct [control](/decisions/) over the feelings that flavor our thought. We must experience our feelings to find what beliefs drive them (which is frequently painful) and there's no shortcut to [understanding](/understanding/) them.

Most people never break their [bias](/trust/) from the feelings they first sensed. This can be trained, but it requires tons of [analysis](/logic/).

When they're sincere, feelings are our [soul's](/humanity/) lifeline to [reality](/reality/). Without feelings, we don't really identify ourselves *within* reality, and it can create an existential disconnect if we persist in a prolonged state of non-feeling.

## Classifications

Most feelings are based on a few key primitives. To make them easier to see, they've been placed in bold.

**Joy** comes from perceiving things that add [value](/quality/) to our lives, especially when it [appears](/image/) to be new or [meaningful](/meaning/). While we often attribute good things to joy, [mentally well people](https://adequate.life/happiness-1/) find joy in [habitual](/habits/) things without provocation. Taken too far, though, the pursuit of joy becomes [addiction](/addiction/).

It's worth addressing that "happiness" can mean two different things. It can either mean joy, or the general [absence of desire](https://adequate.life/happiness-1/). To [live well](/good-life/), someone should have either of them approximately 30-70% of the time during any given day.

**Sadness** comes from perceiving a loss. While it can apply to almost anything, it's usually over the loss of a [friendship](/friendship/) or of [power](/power/).

When we feel a significant loss, we *always* cycle through five stages of **grief**. While each stage can last for years with a great loss, we can feel each stage for a small loss for less than a second:

1. Denial - [uncertainty](/certainty/) the thing happened
2. Anger - certainty the thing happened but a feeling of [injustice](/justice/) about it
3. Bargaining - attempting to [negotiate](/conflicts-inner/) to regain the thing
4. Depression - [imagining](/imagination/) the void of the thing in our lives
5. Acceptance - reluctantly admitting [reality](/reality/)

**Surprise** is when events don't follow our [expectations](/imagination/). We can attach it to other feelings to create anything from excitement to horror, but it *always* corresponds to things we don't [understand](/understanding/) before they happen.

**Disgust** is when we feel repulsed by something, and is the basis of social [taboos](/taboos/). When directed inward, it becomes [guilt and shame](/ptsd/), but it's the foundation for being [productive](/results/).

**Anger** is when we react to a [perceived](/image/) [injustice](/justice/) or when we [fear](/fear/) losing [power](/power/) or not having enough of it to accomplish our [desires](/purpose/). Generally, it's a catch-all feeling when we don't understand how to feel otherwise.

Anger is a secondary emotion because it requires *two* beliefs at once:

1. Belief of loss or perceived loss.
2. A belief that the loss was [unjust](/justice/).

Compared to others, the feelings of [**boldness/confidence**](/certainty/) and [**fear**](/fear/) are *far* more pervasive, and create the foundations of our [personality](/personality/). Further, while [**love**](/love/) can refer to affection, it sits more as a habit of giving [inherent value](/quality/) to something.

We also mix-and-match feelings *far* more than any other animal:

- **Anticipation** and **exhilaration** is when we [expect](/imagination/) something fortunate to happen, and **disappointment** is when it didn't.
- **Confusion** is when we [desire](/purpose/) to [know](/understanding/) something but don't.
- We feel **closure** when we don't know something, but *don't* desire to know it.
- Anger requires [trusting](/certainty/) our [decisions](/decisions/) matter, or it'll become **despair** or depression.
- **Boredom** is the combination of curiosity and anger.
- **Regret** is when we wish we'd have done something different.

There are hundreds of [words](/language/) to capture every feeling, especially as the object of our situation changes (and provides further associated feelings), and they're *still* not precise enough to be accurate to capture most of the sensations.

## Focus

We can only feel what we're focused on, which is frequently trying to "[fix](/purpose/)" the world around us. If we're simply running through a [habit](/habits/) or distracted by doing two things at once, we won't feel anything about something.

Most of our feelings come from [purposes](/purpose/) we've subconsciously built and from an experience's novelty. If we learn something becomes impossible to control (e.g., [death](https://adequate.life/death/)) and have gained extreme [understanding](/understanding/) of it, we can slowly release that control in our own way.

We tend to be *very* unaware of our feelings until we experience results from them, which is why we need [emotional outlets](/results/) and [conversations](/conversation/) about topics we feel strongly about. Generally, the feelings hold [power](/power/) over our [decisions](/decisions/) proportionally to how unaware we are of them.

All feelings have an object in mind, at least when we first [perceive](/image/) that object. However, we can often forget the source later, which will leave a neurological haze of generalized thought that triggers that feeling again without much explanation.

When a person isn't [self-aware](https://adequate.life/awareness/) of a feeling, they usually staple a quick [decision](/decisions/) to it. People frequently redirect feelings to another source, which psychology calls transference or projection.

Our feelings are the basis for intuition. Intuition is an instinctual [reaction](/habits/) that streamlines how we respond to things, built around the [stories](/stories/) from our subconscious [understanding](/understanding/) of [reality](/reality/).

## Intensified

If an [experience](/image/) was particularly [influential](/influence/) towards our [understanding](/understanding/) or [desire](/purpose/) (especially if it was [traumatic](/ptsd/)), our feelings can persist to frame further beliefs, which can create secondary feelings with *much* more power over our actions:

- Anger that lingers becomes **bitterness**.
- Fear, long-term, becomes **anxiety**.
- Sadness, when overused, becomes **grief**.
- Regret long-term becomes **shame**.
- Sadness can become despair, which becomes **depression** when unresolved.

If a feeling persists and is reinforced enough, it becomes a [conviction](/certainty/).

If any adverse feeling lingers long enough, it becomes a [mental illness](https://adequate.life/hardship/). Enough mental illness, from an [early enough age](/maturity/), creates most [neurodivergence](https://notageni.us/neurodivergent/).

## Patterns

When we feel something, continuing in feeling it without any restraint will intensify our feelings about it even further.

When our feelings our configured to experienced [patterns](/symbols/), we have what's called an "intuition" for something.

Intuitive thinking is *extremely* useful, in its place. It's the basis for how we form [habits](/habits/), and experts in [most fields](/specialization-cities/) develop intuitive [skills and understanding](/understanding/) that make their job easier and faster.

At the same time, intuition has severe risks. It's only reliable when proven patterns have come before it. Otherwise, we're acting on memories that aren't accurate. If we persist on those past thoughts, it's likely we're imposing our [past trauma](/ptsd/) into present [decisions](/decisions/) as well.

Further, intuition is *really* difficult to [analyze](/logic/). If our self-reflection ever becomes a judgment of what we feel (instead of merely acceptance), we'll redefine our intuition to new [beliefs](/certainty/) about what's "right", even [when it's not](/personality/). Over time, we will make that distorted state of [imagination](/imagination/) become our new "normal" (i.e., "dysregulation").

## Repositioning

The beauty of our mind's neuroplasticity, however, is that we are always capable to rewire how we [habituate](/habits/) our feelings. While we don't typically need to reconfigure our baser feelings (e.g., fear, anger), protracted mental feeling-beliefs can be rebuilt:

- Bitterness - [Release](https://adequate.life/happiness-2/) whatever you feel compelled to [control](/purpose/).
- Anxiety - Find [fear](/fear/) in *much* worse things, which is typically through death.
- Grief - Add [understanding](/understanding/) that your suffering isn't permanent, and that your loss isn't as bad as you feel.
- Shame - Form [an identity](/identity/) around something that's *not* the actions you've performed.
- Depression - Start and focus on maintaining [habits](/habits/) that create constructive, healthy routines.

Mental illness, however, makes this ordeal *much* more challenging, since each of the fixes creates adverse ripple effects on all the other emotions:

- Releasing what you have control of (to fight bitterness) may spiral you further into depression.
- Learning to relax (to fight anxiety) may lead to discovering bitterness that drives hidden [purposes](/purpose/).
- Recognizing the impermanence of the situation (to fight grief)
- Making a new identity (to fight shame) may give you more grief (from the loss of what had happened).
- Starting new habits (to fight depression) may increase your anxiety if you're unfamiliar with those tasks.

In fact, the only way to reliably work through mental illness is through [devotion to God](/religion/), and most effectively within Christianity.

## Application

If you want to change your feelings, change your physical state. Furrowing your brow will make you think harder, standing up straight will make you more confident, walking faster will make you more productive.

We can differentiate between our [bias](/bias/) and [reality](/reality/) by distinguishing what we're feeling and when. By imagining how we'd perceive if we felt differently, we gain further perspectives and heighten our [understanding](/understanding/) without needing others' input.

Most of our feelings *would* be precisely accurate if they were based on all available information, without imagined information included. Therefore, the best way to perceive [fairly](/justice/) is to note when we're being irrational, then [scientifically](/science/) process *all* information that's contrary to what we feel:

- Jumping to the worst possible conclusion (catastrophizing)
- Thinking in extreme all-or-nothing [values](/values/) (black-and-white thinking)
- Using general words like "always" or "never" to describe a specific event (overgeneralizing)
- [Predicting the future](/imagination/) instead of waiting to see what happens (fortune-telling)
- Focusing on the negative/positive aspects while ignoring the others (mental filtering)
- Discrediting a positive/negative thing or adapting it into the inverse (disqualifying)
- Globally self-declaring oneself as a failure/success, worthless/perfect, or useless/important (labeling)
- Listening more to gut feelings than observable reality (emotional reasoning)
- Taking an event or person's behavior personally (personalizing)
- Making rigid [rules](/rules/) about self/people/reality with words like "should"/"must"/"have to" (demanding)
- Declaring something as unbearable when it's attainable and worth tolerating (no frustration tolerance)

[Decisions](/decisions/) based on feelings are a type of "temporary insanity" that are about 20-40 IQ points lower than our rational thoughts, but simple awareness of them is critical for [wellness](/good-life/). In fact, the secret to most [awareness](https://adequate.life/awareness/) involves simply acknowledging and identifying our feelings through [language](/language/) without taking action.

Sensational things hit our feelings more, and we should be [distrustful](/trust/) proportionally to the [sensationalism](/image/). This isn't easy because anger gives us the [impression](/image/) that we have [power](/power/), so we're easy to [influence](/influence/) toward things that make us angry.

Below everything else that we perceive, we feel. Those feelings define the components we can [logically](/logic/) assemble into our [perceptions](/image/). They're the raw information we must synthesize, but also must never forget where we got them.

We can only feel things if we believe we're a participant in that thing, or it's new to us. If we see ourselves as simply an outside observer of *everything* and constantly [educate](/pedagogy/) ourselves, we'd have very few feelings about anything.

Anger is *very* useful to get things done, but it ruins our finesse. The only times anger is justified are against objects that can withstand it (e.g., [lifting weights](https://adequate.life/weight/)) or against people who are performing [evil](/evil/). Otherwise, we must instead acknowledge the [fears](/fear/) that drive that anger. "Letting off steam" is simply adding anger onto anger.

Living by feelings, even anger, is an inherent risk. It means we don't [understand](/understanding/) things clearly enough to be [rational](/logic/), and it's possible we may be wrong about something and not know it.

If we've suffered [trauma](/ptsd/), we must work through all the feelings we've experienced to attain [the good life](/good-life/), at least until we've linked them with what our [soul](/humanity/) is experiencing.

Restraining feelings can serve to suppress our feelings, at least to a degree, but comes with the risk of stifling [action](/results/) in the process. On the other hand, changing [beliefs](/certainty/) over time will *dramatically* change how we directly feel about something while maintaining our means to keep persevering.

Even while the object of the feelings changes, our feelings are [the same as anyone else's](/universals/), so we can easily understand our feelings by observing others' feelings ("surrogation"). The only alternative is self-reflection, which is difficult to perform because our minds aren't entirely [tethered to reality](/imagination/).

The long-term adverse feelings of depression, shame, and anxiety aren't *bad* to have, but they represent a long-term viewpoint that needs changing. This requires us to constrain our adverse emotional states to a minimum possible range to make room for other emotional experiences.
