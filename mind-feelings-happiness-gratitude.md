# The gratitude ladder

No matter what our position in life, we can always do one of two things:

1. . Be grateful for the things we have.
2. Be unhappy about the things we lack.

This parses into a ladder, which is this list.

The syntax is as follows:

- A is what you have.
- B is another thing you don't have.
- Complaints: "I hate (A) because I don't have (B)!"
- Gratitude: "I'm glad I have (A) because I don't have (B)!"

Ambition is often simply [creative](mind-creativity-how.md) ingratitude:

- B is what you want.
- X is your means to get B.
- Motivation: "I want (B), so I'm going to (X)!"

This is a general strata, and this isn't a hard list of spectra.

- The rankings are based on a generalized approach of which one is deemed "better" by society's approximate standards.
- The purpose of this is to make it abundantly clear that things are both awful and great, depending how you look at it.

While this is categorized, we can also often jump between strata.

- It magnifies either our capacity for thankfulness, or our capacity for entitlement.
