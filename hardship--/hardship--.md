A Reason To Go To Therapy
The classic therapist-produced view of mental health sees it as inside you — in your psyche, in your mind. However, mental health is not inside you. Mental health is the harmony of your existence in relationship to other people and to the future. The sense of wellbeing that infuses you (if you get the balance right) is not a reflection of the proper functioning of your mind or brain; it is a phenomenon that emerges when everything is in its proper place and operating harmoniously. 
If you have the proclivity to feel one negative emotion more intensely, then you also have the proclivity to feel all negative emotions. They covary — meaning, they tend to occur together — because all negative emotions are the manifestation of the abstraction of a system that stops you from moving forward or moves you backwards or, in another variant, prepares you to fight. 
But when you go to therapy, you aim to make your life better, and your therapist is on your side, wanting to help you. So, you explore what “better” means for you because, in some ways, “better” is something you conceivably determine in joint consultation with your therapist. Jointly, you attempt to solve the problem, but you must define what “better” is because that is what you are aiming at. First your therapist helps you explore the complexities of your identity — past, present, and future — so that your misery can be ameliorated.

Justify The Catastrophe Of Your Life By Developing A Vision
Craft a vision. Craft a compelling vision. As human beings, we are visionaries, which is how we confront the horizon of the future. In other words, we meet the horizon of the future by crafting a compelling vision. Your vision should be one that, if you could make it come to fruition, it would justify the trouble it would take you to manage it. That is the right attitude to take in your life. 
We all have our crosses to bear in the most fundamental manner. We must contend with the catastrophe of mortality, and we must face the reality of hell (which you can think about in the religious sense or not). There are other types of hell on earth that we certainly have no shortage of in the 21st century. So we must all grapple with the realities of mortality and hell. 
Then, we must accept the fact we have to develop a vision for our life so compelling that it justifies those bitter realities. That is the nature of the religious enterprise, a journey upon which you can embark. If you are attempting to figure out who you are, figure out who you need to be in order to justify the catastrophe of your life. It will be difficult, but it will also be worth it.

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?— Romans 8:35

God doesn’t promise to make us immune to trouble; God promises to be with us in trouble. It doesn’t matter what kind of trouble; even the most extreme hardship can never separate us from God.

“In all these things we are more than conquerors” (Romans 8:37). The “things” Paul is talking about in this verse aren’t imaginary; they are desperately real. And yet, Paul says, in the middle of all our hardships, we are super-victors—not because of our intelligence or our courage, but because nothing can affect our relationship to God in Jesus Christ. Whether we like it or not, we are where we are, exactly in the condition we’re in. I am sorry for Christians who have nothing difficult in their circumstances.

“Shall trouble . . . ?” Trouble is never a noble thing, but neither is it all-powerful. No trouble, says Paul, “will be able to separate us from the love of God” (v. 39). Let trouble be what it is. Let it be exhausting and irritating. But never let it separate you from the reality that God loves you.

“Shall . . . hardship . . . ?” Can God’s love hold when everything around us seems to be saying that his love is a lie, and that there is no such thing as justice?

“Shall . . . famine . . . ?” Can we not only believe in God’s love but be more than conquerors even when we are being starved? Either Jesus Christ is a deceiver and Paul is deluded, or something extraordinary happens to the soul who holds on to God’s love when the facts are against God’s character.

“More than conquerors . . .” Logic is silenced in the face of Paul’s claim. Only one thing can account for what he says: the love of God in Christ Jesus. “Out of the wreck I rise,” every time.
