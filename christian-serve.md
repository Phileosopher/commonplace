# How to serve as a Christian

Some people simply aren't experienced or [creative](mind-creativity.md) enough to see where people are hurting.

For that reason, here's a concise list to get the thoughts rolling.

- Statistically, your [gifts](christian-gifts.md) and [personality](personality.md) make you best-suited for *some* sort of ministry on this list.

Most healthy churches have plenty of volunteers, and they'll usually pick people who have served before.

- Many people within a church can be motivated towards self-interested purposes, so it can get complicated.
- Look *beyond* official church meetings for the greatest needs, such as community services and parachurch organizations.
