# Factories

Most factory engineering is a dramatic experience of hyper-specialized tools. Factory robots can reproduce just about any task a person can do repetitively, even complex ones, and most factory assemblies are designed to accomplish 1 task tens of thousands of times, with minor retooling necessary as machinist requires.

Most factory machines are designed to create as clean a product as possible, for both ease of use and [aesthetic](engineering-design.md) appeal to the end user. Most of the small idiosyncratic details in a factory machine (e.g., shaking an object quickly before setting it down again) are designed for maximum efficiency and to create the most effective product. Many of them are also [trade secrets](legal-ip.md).
