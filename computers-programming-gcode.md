# The G-code programming language

A specific programming language for physical implementations of a computer (e.g., [robotics](computers-robotics.md), [automotives](computers-autos.md), [3D printers](engineering-printers.md)) that uses Cartesian coordinates to indicate precisely where an object should begin or end.

The code is very low-level: almost like C, but for physical space.
