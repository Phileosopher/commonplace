# What art is

Art is any expression of the human condition. To that end, all art is a [creation](creations.md), even if it was [grown](horticulture.md) or created via automation [technology](technology.md).

The consumption and expression of art is a critical component of living [the good life](goodlife.md). Without it, we tend to flounder in our connection with [meaning](meaning.md).

[God](god.md) has created art within nature, and that represents itself in how we find inherent [beauty](values-quality.md) in many naturally-occurring things. All our derived works are pulled straight from nature.

APPLICATION: To create beautiful art, consult nature. To create ugly art (such as a [post-modern expression](philosophy.md)), consult something abstracted from nature like [technology](technology.md) or [man's sin](morality-sins.md).

## Art culture

Since the capturing of art is perpetually working within the realm of [The Unknown](unknown.md), the [culture](people-culture.md) of artists is composed of equally adventurous and [unhinged](mind-neurodivergence.md) individuals.

APPLICATION: Artists, by their [personality](personality.md), aren't very efficient workers, so never expect reliable work from them.

## Evoking feelings

The entire purpose of art is to evoke a [feeling](mind-feelings.md), and most people intuitively perceive the [quality](values-quality.md) of a piece of art by several criteria:

1. How effectively a feeling was evoked.
2. The range of feelings that have been sufficiently evoked.
3. How well those feelings have captured an experience to make it seem [real](reality.md).

This is far harder than it sounds. It requires several conditions:

1. The creator is intimately in touch with their own feelings.
2. The creator has skill in some form of media to express those feelings.
3. The creator remembers their audience enough that they avoid over-expressing feelings in a way that muddles the intended message.

## Industry standards

It's only natural, in the flow of evoking feelings, that some media and [genres](art-genres.md) will have some set standards that always work to evoke an experience.

### Media

Animation

- With the exception of an intentionally dismal setting, bright and vibrant contrasting colors
- Even with lifelike animation, everything is vastly exaggerated

Film

- The 1-hour mark defines the most memorable part of the film, irrespective of the rest of the film's length

Games

- Make the player character either incredibly uninteresting (for the player to act out their preferred behaviors) or set to be a few major possible roles (to reflect the general decisions of the player)

Stage

- All emotional expressions are accompanied by flagrant body language

### Genre

Action

- Constantly changing scenes or perspectives that are only intentionally interspersed with calm moments to give a contrast

Comedy

- Set the character in a familiar setting that most of the audience will relate to

Horror/Thriller

- Only reveal portions of the antagonist, but never the full scope of the character, even during the climax of the story
- If any audio is present, use extremely low-frequency audio (infrasound) to evoke [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md)
