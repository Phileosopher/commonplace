# The C++ programming language

At first, Bjarne Stroustrup wanted an extension of the C language, but it eventually evolved into its own high-level language.

While the language is general-purpose, it's frequently a heavily-used language for [audio engineering](computers-speakersmic.md). It is *very* powerful, though it can sometimes be unwieldy.

One of its downsides is that it's *very* complex, and those complexities make it difficult to communicate algorithms to other developers or quickly modify code.
