# Adam to Jesus chronology

This is a chronological history spanning from Adam to Jesus on the presumption that the Bible's chronology is literal.

- If it *wasn't* literal, we'd need a viable explanation for both *how* it was supposed to be interpreted, and *when* we need to stop looking at it literally.
- The references in question include [Genesis 5](https://biblehub.com/genesis/5.htm), [Genesis 11](https://biblehub.com/genesis/11.htm),

I've arranged it based on AM (Anno Mundi) and BC (Before Christ).
