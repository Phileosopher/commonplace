## Genetic engineering

Editing genes uses CRISPR technology (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). The procedure requires 2 steps:

1. Use a guide RNA (gRNA) bound to the enzyme Cas9 to cut DNA at a specified location.
2. Allow the body's natural DNA healing processes to take over.

This allows genes to be replaced with a more favorable genetic sequence.
