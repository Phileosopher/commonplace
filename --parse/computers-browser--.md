- it's the lists, NOT the adblock software, that makes everything run correctly
- that list is basically the blacklist that stops the ads

- what is the roving tabindex? [HTML Roving tabindex Attribute Explained with Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-roving-tabindex-attribute-explained-with-examples/)
- What does the "header" element in HTML do at the top of a webpage?
    - What does the "footer" element in HTML do?
    - The head tags contain metadata including title and stylesheets for a website (not to be confused with the header)
    - HEADER VS HEAD IN HTML??
    - This tag (X-UA-COMPATIBLE) specifies the document mode for Internet Explorer.
- The element stands for Bidirectional Isolate.
- The terms elements and tags are used interchangeably. Tags consist of left and right angle brackets ( < and >) and often come in pairs, with an opening and closing one. Elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, attributes that go inside the starting tag and text content (and possibly other elements) in between the opening and closing tag. So, an element refers to the whole thing.
- The html tag is the root level element that contains all of the other HTML elements
- Character entities allow you to display reserved HTML characters in your document.
- (specify a few)
- The rel attribute is used to show the relationship between the linked document and the HTML file.
- The element is used to connect content to a machine-readable translation.

- A hyperlink, also called a link or web link, contains an address for a destination and acts as a reference to data. A user can easily follow, jump to, and be directed to the destination by either clicking, tapping on, or hovering over the link.

## social network design

In effect, the power of an internet user is defined by how much time they spend curating their communication to ride the waves of an algorithm. This system creates a power dynamic defined by how much they're not doing other more important things, alongside the defined agenda that a social media algorithm has been programmed to endorse. When people consume that every day, it creates a minority of people who do nothing but work themselves into an agitated froth with not much else to show for it.

## web apps

REDDIT COMMENT
Making an application run in multiple platforms (Android, macOS, Windows, etc) is a huge pain, but what do all platforms have in common? They can all run Chrome, and Chrome can run portable (but slow) code.
So what do developers do?
Developers write applications as standalone web pages and bundle a whole copy of the Chrome* browser to view that "web page". The application now takes hundreds of megabytes of storage, eats RAM like candy, and every interaction is massively slowed down because it has to go through so many layers.
The address bar is hidden, and the right click menu is replaced, but it's still a web browser under the hood.
They are basically saving developer time by wasting your time and device resources. That's a big reason why modern applications (Teams, Discord, Spotify, etc) feel so slow.
* Technically "Chromium", since it's missing some features like Google account log in. The most popular framework that uses this technique is Electron.

## website structure

In a website:
- HTML determines structure
- CSS determines style
- JS determines functionality

NOTE: INDICATE HOW THINGS LIKE ELECTRON MAKE MOST SMALLER WEB VS APP DEV A TRIVIAL DIFFERENCE
