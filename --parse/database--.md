A database is a structured set of data stored in a computer designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and maintenance.

Normalized databases are optimized to reduce data redundancy.

A stack is a linear data structure that uses the LIFO(Last In First Out) method.

SQL is used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data in relational database management systems.

An individual entry in a table of a database is known as record or row.

information online is stored in databases. A database is really just a
list-but the computer or program has to be able to be able to parse and
use what's inside the list. This means someone-the programmer-must
choose what questions will be asked and what options the user will have
in responding: Man or Woman? Married or Single? Gay or Straight? It gets
very easy to feel left out. Or old: 0-12, 13-19, 20-34, 35-48, or 49-75?
The architecture of databases requires the programmer to pick the
categories that matter, and at the granularity that matters
