Rome's 3 branches of govt represented the king, aristocracy (via Senate) and democracy (via plebians)
 - this is a retread today, with the Senate being the aristocracy and Congress being the plebians
 - the branches represent nature, comparable to the apex predator, predators, and prey
 - the branches have a checks-and-balances, which inhibits absolute power and therefore creates a balancing to prevent corrupt individuals from taking over entirely
 
The basis is that God is the creator of natural rights
- however, these natural rights are SPECIFICALLY constrained in the case of children, lunatics, and fools

the original reasoning is that the government is NOT responsible for things beyond its scope
- it's not responsible for rectifying misfortune
- it can't do anything about mental illness
- it won't be able to equalize outcome, though it may be able to enforce equal opportunities on a heavy-handed large-scale level

natural rights were derived directly from reasoning, and were NOT estranged from natural law
- later, natural rights were implied to be separate from natural law

the only way that "the people" can be together under one rule is through their voluntary agreement to be in a society
- in that sense, citizenship tests should be for all Americans, and they are a resident alien until then (including mental disability and childhood)
- the idea is that citizenship comes with specific responsibilities

### Freedom

### Federalized Government

the reason governments may be better than other governments with similar services (e.g., Europe's vs America's govt websites) is because there's an unspoken free market
- each government knows that people can freely move to the neighboring government's jurisdiction if they fail hard enough
- the US has this with its states

the axiom "few rules, well-enforced" applies heavily to tax policy
- there are only a few good ways to tax everyone
  1. a flat income tax, with a flat diminished tax rate (e.g., 0% or 4%) for income below the poverty line
  2. sales tax, evenly applied to everything
- sin taxes create the perverse incentive for governments to foster the vices they're technically condemning
- if it's estate tax, it needs to be the same tax rate as gift tax
  - the existence of inheritances will always create social classes, no matter how equal everyone else is otherwise
- GO THROUGH THE OTHER TAXES IN ACCOUNTING PAGES

before we get to environmental activism, we should consider the ecological impact of other domains:
- wars cause more ecological devastation than any logging operation or factory installation could provide
- Waste from factories may be devastating to the wildlife, but it's more devastating to the people who drink the water elsewhere
- i.e., nature can adapt to awful manmade circumstances better than man can adapt to awful manmade circumstances

### The 4th Branch

the Fourth Branch could easily be lumped as a separate domain of government:
- executive
- legislative
- judicial
- ADMINISTRATIVE

look into US forest service, was made ~1910 and may have merged into the EPA

- IDEA: MAKE A LIST THAT SIMPLIFIES THEIR PURPOSE, YEAR FOUNDED, WHAT GOVT BILL

there is a simple concept on how these bureaus have come into presence:
1. Congress/President passes a bill with vague language
2. Administrative branch clearly defines how that applies (especially since the [Chevron deference](legaldoctrines))
3. laws exist without representation

IDEAS:
add missing services that would be needed to "complete" a totalitarian government control
clarify how they could be consolidated (may express itself naturally)
