
80% of marriage problems can't be fixed, they can only be understood

Marriage is a contract
-shared assets, mostly
-intimacy constraints
-shared descisions on large things
-shared descisions on children
-shared responsibilities

possible clauses
-emotional support
-shared vision
-Desires, subconsious

JORDAN PETERSON
Put Forth Effort In Your Relationship
People tend to think all romantic interaction should be spontaneous. If that is your theory and you are going to get married, you might as well just give up right now. When you are married, especially when you have little kids and you both have a job, you are so busy that the probability you are going to find time for spontaneous mutual interaction decreases to zero. So if that is what you are hoping for, then you are never going to have it. What you have to do is make time for each other. 
When you are dating and establishing the relationship, you put effort into it. You go out for dinner, you dress up to some degree, and you try to present yourself in an acceptable manner. Then, you hope there is going to be a positive consequence, and you are going to find each other attractive. But people somehow think that once they are married, the same amount of effort is not necessary — and that is wrong. In fact, more effort is necessary on the same front. You have to think it through. 
My rule of thumb regarding how much time to spend together each week for the sake of the intimate element of your relationship is derived from clinical observations: You need to spend 90 minutes talking with your partner each week. That means telling each other about your lives, staying in touch so that you each know what the other is up to, discussing what needs to be done to keep the household running smoothly, and laying out some mutually acceptable vision of how the next week or the next months are going to go. 

Archive Conversations
Sometimes we get impatient when we eagerly wait for someone to respond to a message. To help with patience, try archiving the conversation after your last unanswered question. This will help prevent you from being reminded about the lack of response whenever you open the app. Out of sight, out of mind.

Be Positive
Sometimes dating can be frustrated. When you meet someone new, try to make your introductions and descriptions positive. With the sheer number of options people are faced with these days, they won't want to spend time on someone who doesn't seem like they're going to bring happiness into their life right off the bat.

It's only a problem if you make it a problem
Frequently people will lament or worry about traits or habits about themselves that they feel someone else may not like. Weight, height, etc. If the person you're interested in doesn't mention it as an issue, then you shouldn't either. You'll only end up putting a negative opinion into their head when in fact they may have never been thinking about it in the first place.

Patience
People have lives. When someone returns to a conversation, the last thing they'll want is to be greeted by a wall of self-doubting neuroticism when they had no mal-intentions. Remember, try to always be positive.

Facts vs Feelings
Win the fight, lose the relationship
Try to remind yourself about your bigger goal when you're fighting. The point isn't to win the argument, the point is to make the relationship succeed. The best way to accomplish this is to remind yourself what you really want in the relationship, and not just how you feel at that exact moment. Try to deliberately lose the fight as quickly as possible and you'll find both you and your partner will be able to resolve things more easily.

number one indicator of divorce:
- they're calmly speaking with each other, but they're tense (i.e., they're speaking to self-protect, NOT to build any sort of relationship)

every person in a relationship will eventually find MANY irritating little things about their partner

we are taught the wrong thing: that love is meant to be the perfect merger of two lives
- live in the same house
- eat the same meals together
- go to bed and get up at the same time
- only have sex with (or even sexual thoughts) about each other
- frequently see each other's families
- have all their friends in common
- think the same thoughts on every topic at every moment

it's an impossibly punitive burden of expectation on another person

another perspective: relationships are fulfilling for 3 different reasons:
1. kindness - gentle with our imperfections and can tolerate us as we are
2. shared vulnerability - open about anxieties, worries, and problems that throw us off, that we can share in weakness
3. understanding - can make sense of our own mind, and who we can understand in turn
we end up feeling loved or satisfied in any other areas if those are in place
we'd still likely feel lonely and short on relations even if we knew all the same information together

From prison psych
Non-negotiables
1. Will we stay married?
2. We must stop labeling each other
  You are..., you do..., because of...
3. We need couples therapy
  We will need intervention if this can go anywhere

## how to cherish a wife

Love is about being gracious and altruistic.
Cherish is about being enthusiastic and enthralled.

Love tends to be quiet and understated.
Cherish boasts boldly and loudly.

Love thinks about others with selflessness.
Cherish thinks about its beloved with praise.

Love doesn’t want the worst for someone.
Cherish celebrates the best in someone.

Love puts up with a lot.
Cherish enjoys a lot.

The key to cherishing is to STOP COMPARING
- don't compare her actions to yours
- don't compare her to other women

It's not just a matter of loving her, but about enjoying her

Let our actions as well as our words show her/him that they are loved, respected and cared for.

MENTAL
Allow your wife to set your standard of beauty, and make it clear to her that she is secure. Your eyes are only for her. Security breeds confidence.

THE PAST
Acknowledge past hurts and forgive them

SHOWING SUPPORT
Surprise your partner by filling up their gas tank
Take care of the kids for a day so that she can have a personal spiritual retreat to recharge.
Help them
Be sensitive to their needs
Clean or organize something of yours she finds messy
Be an advocate for her rest. Gently help her to evaluate and set limits on her to-do list, reminding her that she loves others best when she takes time to replenish.
Be careful and considerate in our language.  Learn to give and receive feedback in a way that empowers your partner and your relationship. 
Acknowledge each other's feelings and the "stories" we tell ourselves without having to defend.
Accept your partner's limitations without comparing them to others and making them feel ashamed for where they may fall short.  You might need to do a "relationship reckoning" which means:  do the things my spouse provide me outweigh the things they don't?  If the answer is no - then you might need to walk away.  If the answer is yes - then you will likely need to grieve what you are missing and do so in a way that does not involve shaming our partner.  

CONFLICTS
When she messes up, respond with the kind of grace, compassion and mercy that God gives us.  Respond in a way that communicates, “You’re safe with me and I’m not going to rehash your failures. This is a secure place for you to grow and I love the journey with you.”

MAINTENANCE
Put effort into developing feelings of closeness
- ask what closeness looks like to her, then try to reproduce those conditions
Meet with your partner for a check-in at the end of the year
Ask important questions and talk about hard topics
Help your partner prioritize rest and self-care
Ask your partner how they feel most cherished
Gently protect her. Lovingly help her set boundaries with her time, energy, resources, and relationships (kids and mothers-in-law included).

PAMPERING/GENEROSITY
Plan out a spa day for her
Plan out a cute Valentine’s Day surprise
Bring your spouse a cup of coffee (or tea) in bed
Learn about your partner’s love language
When in doubt, work on spending quality time together
Make a playlist with songs that specifically encourage things you love about her.

SIGNALING
Remind yourself that you and your partner are on the same team
Let your partner know you’re putting in a conscious effort
Talk to your partner about meeting their emotional need
Remind your partner how much you value them on a daily basis
Leave your partner a love note where they’d least expect it
Send them a random text telling them you love them
Public display of affection
    Post on her Facebook wall: “I love being your husband. You still take my breath away.”
    Have your children write her notes or letters about what they love about her as a mom.
    Remind her of the amazing impact she has on other people and give specific examples.
Take updates
Compliment them
Do not try to change them
Cherish her by sending a text or email, “Praying for you today. Thanks for being so courageous in ________.”
Tell her areas she’s gifted in. Don’t stretch the truth: Be honest so she can trust you.

EXCLUSIVITY
Pay attention when the other is talking.  No distractions.  Eye contact is affirming and shows loving respect and consideration.  Let's have technology free time every day in order to make real time for real connection.  
Make them feel heard: listen to her sincerely

RECOLLECTING
Take out your photo album and reminisce about your wedding day
Remember how much the little things matter

OPENNESS
Talk through your budget together. Make sure you both have the resources you need to care for your family well. Esteem the wise financial decisions she makes.  This definitely shows you cherish her.
Make eye contact with them when they’re talking to you
Remember the power of physical touch in a relationship
Respect your differences
Talk about her fears – both deep and small. Overtime, lead her as you work together to replace those fears with faith in God as expressed in His Word.

PHYSICAL
Be a student of her body. Ask her, both while you’re in bed and at a completely separate private time, how you can please her sexually and make her feel secure and beautiful.
Give her a massage – one that doesn’t lead to sex, unless she’s clear that making love is what she would enjoy most.

DATING
Choose an activity and time for a date night
Be proactive about doing something together that she enjoys. Make a date, get her excited and share her enthusiasm!
Play together: Paintball, laser tag, sand volleyball. Have a picnic, go to the drive-in…

## marriage separation

Separation is NOT ideal
- there's a strange illusion of peace, but it's simply the absence of the current conflict
- you never really have peace until it's properly resolved

Marriage helper's steps
1. calm down - stop thinking about what they're doing or thinking, and focus on yourself
2. get clarity - you're probably ruminating, but you need to check on what the true core issue is
  - we need to calm ourselves and truly look at the situation to see what's going on
  - we may be anxious over things that aren't really part of the issue
  - work on your "pies" - physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects

## ptsd and relationships


1. look at where you are and where you want to be
    - you have to move to a higher level than you've accepted
    - you don't have to be perfect to be ready for love
    write down PRECISELY and CLEARLY what you want
        do NOT hedge the desire: you're choosing across millions of potential people
        that desire should be sensible without rationalization (e.g., marriage with kids)
            if that desire is higher, think of it as a [success] goal to improve your attractability (e.g., become physically attractive to get better prospects)

### emergency measures to re-regulate

Ten Emergency Measures to Re-Regulate
1. Notice when you are dysregulated! Are you flooding with emotion? Adrenaline? Panic?
Say to yourself “I’m having an emotional reaction.” This is a good time to slow down and
be gentle with yourself and others, so you don’t say or do something you’ll regret later.
2. Be safe. This is not a good time to drive a car. Pull over and take your time. If what
triggered you was an argument, use gentle words to stop the interaction for now, like “I
want to continue this conversation, but I need to take a breather to calm down.” Or, if you
don’t want to tell the other person that you’re triggered, tell them you need a bathroom
break, or if you’re on the phone, say you have a call on the other line. Don’t get into a big
discussion about it -- just find a way to put the conversation on pause.
3. Buy some time. Separate from the other person if you can. Go to a room by yourself,
even if it’s the bathroom. No one has to know what you’re doing. If it feels urgent, take
even longer before you try to resolve anything.
4. Stamp your feet. You’d be amazed how helpful it is to bring yourself back into present
time, in your body. As you stamp each foot, say quietly to yourself "right" "left" "right"
"left.” This helps your brain begin to re-regulate.
5. Take ten deep breaths, focusing particularly on the out breath.
6. Press your tongue to the back of your teeth. This is a strategy to get back in your body.
7. Sit down, and feel the weight of your butt in the chair. This is another strategy to get
back inside your body.
8. Eat something. When you’re stressed, you’ll probably crave carbs and sugar, but it’s
protein foods that will help you get grounded again.
9. Wash your hands, and feel the water and soap on your hands. Warm water is
particularly calming.
10. Get a good, squeezing hug. If no one is around, press your back into a corner and wrap
your arms around yourself so you can feel pressure all around your torso. We’re wired to
calm down when we’re hugged!

### patterns of self-defeating behaviors

Neglect of body – Inappropriate or shabby
clothes, poor hygiene, neglect of physical exercise.
Avoidance of medical and dental care, self-harm.

Blame - Difficulty seeing one’s own role in
problems, victim thinking, bitterness, slandering
others, belief that all problems the result of a
country, a race, racism itself, sexism, foreigners, a
political party, religion, lack of religion, certain
foods, your parents, etc.

Black & white thinking - drawn to extreme views,
groups, authority figures, belief systems, often
outraged at the news. Loss of freedom to disagree
or step back from conflict. Dominating others,
slandering others, cutting off contact friends, family
or people outside your group.

Numbing with substances, relieving stress with
alcohol, drugs. Taking more/different medication
than prescribed. See also food, media.
Addictive use of food - carb binging, unhealthy
weight, eating disorders, obsession with “correct”
eating.

Addictive use of media/entertainment, TV, social
media, internet and games enough to interfere
with sleep, meals, daily routine, family
responsibilities, work, school, finances.
Dishonesty - exaggerating, hiding important
personal truths or preferences, lying, stealing,
infidelity, tax evasion, illegal activity.

Work problems - chronic adversarial relationships
with employers & coworkers, unfulfilling work,
under-earning, neglect of learning/skill
development, periods of unemployment, suing or
getting sued.

Irritability - frequent arguments, falling out with
friends, neighbors, partners, family, ranting, rage,
mistreating others, revenge, violence.

Attraction to troubled partners/friends -
repeatedly drawn into relationships that turn out to
be abusive, controlling, damaging to other
relationships, family and finances. Claiming others
are abusive, narcissistic, etc. but staying in the
relationship. Rationalizing why staying is necessary.

Unfulfilling romantic life - no dating relationships,
staying in bad relationships, creating/staying in
sexless or loveless partnership.

Abuse of Sexuality - overly sexualized
appearance and conduct. Loss of dignity,
emotional security or the ability to be "real"
around sex and relationship dynamics, doing things
one doesn't want to do, or that make one feel
ashamed. Unwanted pregnancy, compulsive
behavior around sex.

Fantasy (romantic, financial) - a flight from
reality when things are tough, not really "here," not
in touch with reality. Failure to take reasonable
action, huge, unrealistic expectations and promises,
inflating the importance of relationships, events,
personal attributes, prospects. Obsession, stalking,
neglect of health, work, family.

Avoidance of people, responsibility,
participation - isolating, "social anorectic," can
sometimes do this as a couple or group, avoiding
all others.

Debting - living beyond means to pay for home,
car, therapy, etc. Growth of debt, gambling,
foreclosure, bankruptcy, homelessness, vague sense
of the path toward solvency.

Repeating traumatic patterns - seeming inability
to detect trouble or step back when trouble
appears -- relapse into traumatized state,
triggering deepening of depression, rage,
collapse, reversion to old behaviors.

### attraction to unavailable or inappropriate people

Was married or in a serious
relationship with someone other than
me, while we were together?

Wanted to keep our relationship
secret

Was alcoholic or had an addiction

Was not in love with me

Was emotionally not there for me

Had serious drama that stood in the
way of our relationship (for example,
a feud with an ex)

Insisted on seeing other people, even
though that’s not what you wanted

Would not commit to you, even though
that’s what you wanted

Was not aware of your love for them
(“just friends”)

Caused you to feel ashamed that you
were with such an inappropriate
person

NOTE: when we put up with bad behavior, we're emotionally unavailable
- we don't realize it, but we're cutting ourselves off from more meaningful relationships and connections

there are many reasons why this may be the case:
    it's possible that our flawed parenting can predispose us to bad attractions
    it's also possible we're repeating our childhood experiences to see if we can "fix" it
    it may make us so disconnected that ANY connection will hijack our entire central nervous system
    we may be thinking that only unhealthy people would ever accept us for who we are
    traumatized people have an unconscious language they share with each other
        though, they'll ping-pong their trauma back-and-forth
    even when we crave unavailable people, we ourselves were unavailable, and we'll consciously say we want commitment but will unconsciously choose a partner that won't have much in the emotional connection department
    we may enjoy getting hurt ("masochism") or love risk, but it's more that we're often going into relationships completely blind
TO AL HARDSHIP
however, it doesn't matter WHY, and all that matters is that we create structures that support us toward what we want
you never really have to figure out WHY, and simply need to know WHAT, and then what to do to make it stop

### fitting ourselves to bad things

codependence - we find someone with problems, then conform ourselves to them
    they become a project for us to revolve our lives around, which is easy to do when we have no structure of our own
    this can work for a time, since that person will be fine with it, up until they find it adverse, then they'll push away
justifying - stating that if you leave, bad things will happen
    we imply that we need to do something
psychologizing - a type of justifying based on psychological diagnoses
    we're basically counting on someone who cannot commit
fantasizing - imagining things in our mind as a type of escape
    it will either attract people who are also fantasizing, or people whose prefer that someone's soul is not really there
mysticizing - making a religious basis to justify bad behavior
    past lives, astrology, soul mates, etc
    since relationships are very much a day-to-day experience, they must exist in a day-to-day way
    "I'm experiencing things I'm meant to learn"
    "I cheated on them in a past life, so I'm now experiencing what they experienced"
    if they're a soul mate, they're a mate to every part of you

### intimacy triggers

Getting attention

Being ignored

Being loved

Not being loved

Being IN love

Being reminded of past relationships
or hurts

Being reminded of past abuse

Fear of abandonment

Sharing money, friends,
responsibilities, space

Partner’s anger

Feeling embarrassed by partner

Fighting with partner

Feeling not good enough for partner

We have to be our authentic selves
- it's not uncommon for us to have past trauma that forces us to place a false persona outwardly to others

### unacceptable people and situations

Did I try to “help” someone who was
capable of helping themselves?

Did I financially support someone
where this was not deserved or
appropriate?

Did I tolerate addiction/alcoholism in
my partner, to a degree that
damaged my own life?

Did I tolerate emotional abuse
(threats, name-calling, making a scene
in public)

Did I allow myself to be controlled?

Did I tolerate disrespectful behavior
like cheating, public intoxication,
verbal abuse?

Did I tolerate physical abuse?

Did I allow my partner to keep me
apart from friends and family, or
disrupt my career?

Did I spiritualize or mysticise or use
magical thinking to convince myself

our relationship was more real than it
was?

Did I fantasize about someone
unavailable to me, to the point it
interfered with relationships, or other
parts of my life?

### your role in problems

Blame my parents for problems that were at
least partly caused by me?

Blame a partner for problems where, when
I’m honest, I shared responsibility?

Verbally or emotionally abuse a partner
(for example, name calling, making threats,
making a scene in public)

Physically hurt a partner?

Hide my role in creating problems, in order
to make a partner feel guilty, or to prove a
point?

Neglect my physical health (avoiding
healthcare, dental care, using drugs/alcohol
to a harmful degree, let myself go in terms
of hygiene)

Fall into black and white thinking, judging
people as all good or all bad
Lie to partners, friends, employers, the
government, etc.,

Gravitate toward unfulfilling or poorly paid
jobs, believing somehow others would solve
this problem for me?

Use lawsuits or restraining orders frivolously,
in order to retaliate against perceived
hurts?

Falsely accuse someone (even a public
figure) of a crime, or gossiped about them,
that hurt their reputation?

Fail to stand up for myself at critical
moments?

Lose my temper in a way that later made
me feel ashamed?

Avoid people and normal levels of
participation in groups or community?

Use sex or aggression or provocative
behavior to manipulate anyone or push them
to do things they didn’t want to do?

Allow myself to fall into debt, when it could
have been avoided, or when common sense
actions could get me out?

Repeat the same mistakes without
knowing why?

Assume responsibility for things that are
NOT my fault, just to feel some control
over those problems?

Hear from people close to me that they
feel I take advantage of them?

Expect too much of myself to a point
that I never knew what is my fault and
what is not?

Fear what I’d have to face, and what I’d
have to do, if I took responsibility for my
mistakes?

We can have trouble with relationships from several angles
    Hiding - pulling away from everything
    Escaping - can be ANY [substance], really
    Clinging - overly enmeshed with someone
    Controlling - trying to make someone do something
        can also be subtle, such as yelling at people or calculating

### fear of being alone

Hooked up with, lived with or married
someone I didn’t really want to be with,
just to avoid being alone?

Stayed in relationships where I wasn’t
loved or respected, just to avoid being
alone?

Suffered from fear of abandonment to
an unhealthy degree?

Fell into an “abandonment depression,”
where being left caused a negative
mental state way out of proportion to
the situation, or to what other people
seem to experience?

Have never lived alone?

Fill my time with “busy-ness”, or activities
I don’t actually enjoy, just to avoid being
alone?

what to do if this fear exists:
1. work on re-regulation muscles
2. seriously build connections with people EVERYWHERE
    - we're part of a web of people, and are very social
    - the partner should never be the end-all and be-all of our lives
3. make a list of 25 things you can do alone

### steps to take

we must take our own responsibility for our problems
- many of our problems are NOT self-created, but we've inherited it
- it's a "debt" we are responsible to pay off, and will live with that debt's consequences until we pay it off

addictions have a tendency to "stick" with others
- there are MANY resources for most [addictions]

it's not uncommon to have hate
- hate comes from generalized statements that arise in the presence of other issues

we must get our act together to clear the decks
- this must come from a sincere approach to find closure together

### how to break up

some people get into lopsided relationships where one person doesn't like the other
- the one who has feelings get an object of their affections
- the one without feelings gets adoring, caring attention
you're trading the benefits of availability for the short-term emotional attachment that goes nowhere

“I wanted to talk to you about our friendship. I have the sense that there’s some attraction on your
part, and though I really like you and value your friendship, I don’t have those kinds of feelings for
you. It’s not your fault. You’ve done nothing wrong. I’m working on cleaning up my life and my
relationships, because I want to one day be in a healthy relationship, and it’s made me realize I need
to end our friendship. I’m sorry.”

also be honest about your feelings with them:
“I want to talk about our friendship. When I’m honest with myself, I notice that I’ve always had an
attraction to you, but I know that’s not the way you feel about it. And that’s fine. I’ve been working on
my capacity to have better relationships and I’ve realized that as much as I love having you as a
friend, it’s kind of “using up” the part of me that needs to be emotionally available. It’s not your fault!
You’ve done nothing wrong. But I’ve come to the realization that I need to end our friendship so I can
move on.”

avoid criticizing, blaming, or shaming them whatsoever

For partners who have treated you well, but it’s just not a match:
● Remember that they deserve communication and honesty, even if it is gentle.
● Take into consideration how long you’ve been dating, and how close the relationship is.
● If you’ve been dating less than about six months, this need only be a single conversation.
● I recommend breaking up in person, unless you’ve only been dating a very short time.
● The best place to meet is in a public place where no one can make a scene, but not so
public that there’s no privacy.
● Let the person know that you are breaking up with them first thing in the conversation. You
do need to give them a reason, but give the minimal amount of information so that they
can understand why.
● Be kind but be clear. Avoid criticizing, blaming or shaming the other person.
● Don’t leave it open-ended, even if it seems like this will make it easier.
● If they are upset, it’s OK to hug them, but make it quick and “cool.” Don’t send mixed
signals.
● Limit the conversation to 20 or 30 minutes.
● If it’s a relationship that’s gone on longer 3-6 months, you might follow the initial
conversation with a phone planned phone call a few days later, once they’ve had a
chance to process what’s happened.
● Don’t agree to get together in person unless it’s necessary to exchange belongings (if you
must do that, consider bringing a friend along with you).
● Don’t get sucked into taking care of them. Don’t suggest you will stay friends, or give them
hope.
● When it’s done, don’t call or text them, and don’t invite them to gatherings, or go where
you will see them (not initially, anyway).
● If you’ve been living with the person, you can adapt the rules as best you can. Set up your
next living situation in advance, so that you can make your exit as soon as possible after
you’ve informed them that you’re breaking up. Let them know of your decision, and go
stay somewhere else until the day when you can remove your things. Don’t stick around
living together until the month is up and your new place is ready.
● Pay your share of the rent for at least a month or two, and then get assistance removing
your things; don’t do it by yourself. If you can arrange openly to do this while your ex is
out of the house, that is a lot easier on them. Be fair and generous in terms of what you
leave behind.

If you are leaving someone who has behaved hurtfully toward you (e.g. cheating,
addiction):
● Limit communication, but don’t ghost them. Likewise, don’t unload on them or berate them.
● Get help to remove your things, pay rent for one month if you choose to, and then don’t
look back.

You Were Not Meant For Marriage
If sex doesn’t matter to you, marriage isn’t for you. In marriage, sex is not optional - it’s core. If you don’t want sex, seek support from friends and relatives, and consider adopting children.
If you want to keep your money separate, stay single. Marriage is a shared vision, shared wallet, and shared sacrifice. You can’t pay bills like roommates and expect the full rewards of marriage. 
If you love your parents and children more than your spouse, marriage will feel like a burden. Your partner must come first. If not, live with your parents and raise your children there.
If you can’t listen, stay alone. Marriage is not ruled by one voice. It’s built by two humble hearts that listen to each other. Know-it-alls depress their partner. Humility holds love together.
If you’re not correctable, stay single. If you can’t say “I’m sorry,” you can’t live with anyone. Marriage is not for the proud. Marriage is for people who own up their mistakes and apologize.

## done for now

A few courses I haven't taken:
- Dr. John Gottman's The Art and Science of Love (https://www.gottman.com/product/the-art-and-science-of-love-online/). I saw the following and wish to honor it, though I already paid for the course:
  - The Art & Science of Love Online course and manual are provided for general educational purposes only. If you or a family member are experiencing personal or family problems such as physical or sexual abuse, active alcoholism, or drug addiction, child abuse, mental illness, or serious depression, especially if suicide is a concern, we urge you to seek professional treatment immediately and only consider using this online workshop and manual with the consultation and support of a trained mental health professional.
  - I'd be happy to explore it once it gets approved by a psychological professional.
- Spark My Relationship (https://sparkmyrelationship.com/) from something similar:
  - The course is not suitable if there is violence, abuse or infidelity in your relationship, or a recent history of such occurrences. Such issues require more direct assistance from a professional than what our course is able to provide.

My marriage had the same breakdown as my dad's and probably everyone's:
1 life is a Shakespeare sonnet
2 life gets rhythmic
3 one partner stops responding the same to something
4 other partner stops initiating
5 the responding partner suspects issues, sex life collapses
6 friction persists until something breaks
7 life is a Greek tragedy
