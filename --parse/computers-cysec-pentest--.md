DELIVERY
One not-too-uncommon approach to distribute less-than-legitimate software and content online is to intentionally get neighboring websites:
- (use actual example) barbecuetips.com might be an amazing site for BBQ-related tips, so hackers will take up barbbecuetips.com, bbqtips.com, barbecuetips.co, barbecuetips.net, and so on
- one of the most successful was whitehouse.com during the Clinton years, which was a porn site.

## antivirus

tip Overall Strategy

Diversify your analysis approach.

Don't rely on the results from a single tool.

Run everything with as few privileges as necessary.

APT investigations must be seperated from commodity malware, otherwise you give malware authors "ideas".

Treat everything like it could be malicious until you have enough evidence to suggest otherwise.

## hacking types - ddos

DDoS can be layer 4 or layer 7

## Hacking Types

A specific type of attack prevention: deploy various file types (randomly named) for tracking an encryption attack (i.e., terminates an encrypting process mid-process)

types of phishing:
Standard phishing, like cold-call sales, sends out many emails at once to get anyone gullible enough to give information.
Spear phishing writes a personal letter to someone with potentially privileged information.
CEO fraud and government phishing use an official-looking email address like a company CEO or government bureau.
Clone phishing copies a legitimate message with an attachment and sends an identical one with a virus attachment instead.
Cloud phishing sends a link to a cloud service to download a seemingly legitimate file.

### PBX Hacking
By hacking a phone, hackers can incur fees of a legit company "calling" a toll-based number
1. Route the phone via voicemail (default password is last 4 of phone #) to another place, which can rack up expenses when people try calling it
2. make phone calls that originate from a known IP address for a PBX, where the IP can be the source phone # for other calls
