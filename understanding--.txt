there are several ways to see things based on our (specializations)
1 agriculturally - time delay on actions
2 industrially - immediate feedback
3 technologically - low information with magnified work

managers are 1
most human and labor work is 2
tech work is 3
1 requires (trusting) things will work out
3 runs the world right now comparatively, but we only reap from (the unknown) when we live by 1
- this is essentially trusting God
