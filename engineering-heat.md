# Engineering regarding heat

Temperature management is a heavy requirement in most advanced systems.

- Too much heat, and things will melt or disintegrate.
- Too little heat, and some processes won't sufficiently engage.

To that end, the [standard](standards.md) must be precise.

Most of the time, the measurement holds to Celsius/centigrade. However, there are plenty of specific reasons to use other measurements like Fahrenheit or Kelvin.
