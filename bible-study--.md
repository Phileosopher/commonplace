do NOT start with the question on any passage, "what does this mean to me?"
- instead, that's the LAST question you ask

ways to approach God's word:
1 synchronic (bullet points)
    - making categories of the domains of the Bible (e.g., God, sin, atonement, faith, etc.)
    - focuses on the means (i.e., justification by faith)
2 diachronic (story-based)
    - moving the Bible across its conveyed message (e.g., creation, fall, redemption, renewal)
    - focuses on the trajectory (i.e., Kingdom of God)
- by looking at it synchronically, we develop a zoomed-in view of what God wants us to see
- diachronic indicates [patterns](symbols) that represent along our entire existence
- healthy understanding of Scripture requires dialectically holding BOTH of them together at the same time (story + bullet points)

when Jesus says "I thank you for hiding the secrets from the wise and giving it to the children"
- it is because He wishes to confide the truths to those who are contrite in spirit, lowly, etc.
- those secrets are MEANT to be hidden to those who wish to exploit it or follow many gods at once

2 Tim 3:16 Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,

All scripture is profitable, but not for all uses or implementations
Doctrine - abstract, certain use
Events - concrete, certain use
Sentiment - abstract, uncertain use

I like to think of it like "layers".
- Layer 1 - skimming the Bible, where you get the gist of the story as a broad concept (or hear about it from someone in that way)
- Layer 2 - reading the proper story (what you're talking about)
- Layer 3 - interconnecting it with other verses and historical context (which commentary is great for)
- Layer 4 - meditating so deeply on it that God gives further connections through prolonged study
All the layers give inspiration, because God is very clever.
