# Jude

The book is a very short one, grouped with no chapters and 25 verses.

Thematically, it is several portions:

- 1-2: greeting
- 3-16: description of the narcissists who corrupt the Church
- 17-23: clear call to the believers to persevere
- 24-25: a doxology that wraps it up

This is a clear indication of Jesus in the Old Testament, which asserts against New Testament-only thinking.

## 14

This is an antagonism against the people who believe sola scriptura (since it references Enoch 1:9), but also more broadly against the so-called "Christians" who assume the Bible is in a divine vacuum.

God does have a sense of humor, and any ungodly sinner who speaks a harsh word against God's "lesser word" is guilty of the condemnation in this verse.
