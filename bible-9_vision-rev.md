# John's Revelation commentary

It is called the "book of vision" because it is a prophetic work.

- More commentary has been written about Revelation than any other book of the Bible.
  - This makes sense, since it explicitly describes what will happen next, and people hate [uncertainty](understanding-certainty.md).
- However, it is a bit foolish to pursue interpreting Revelation right away.
  - To start with, a solid foundation in John's prophecies requires closely examining the prophecies in Isaiah, Daniel, and the other prophets.
  - It also requires unthethering ourselves from the present-day circumstances. Donald Trump, for example, might have nothing to do with anything written in Revelation.
  - Without that basis, people start [predicting weird things](imagination-failedprophecies-0-1199.md).
