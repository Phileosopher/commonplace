# What feelings believe

Since [feelings are low-level beliefs](mind-feelings.md), this is a list of all the beliefs we can impulsively have.

An easy way to parse this list is that (feeling) is a low-level understanding that (simple description).

They are sorted as a type of "map" with how the feelings exist. If it's a sub-category, I try to group it by the dominant feeling.

[Language](language.md) can't always precisely define feelings, so these may not be accurate. However, if you disagree, this list has accomplished its purpose because it made you think about it.
