2050

- It is widely accepted by the scientific community that the year 5 billion will be the end of our Sun's current phase of development, after which it will swell into a red giant, either swallowing the Earth or at least completely scorching it. However, as the Sun grows gradually hotter (over millions of years), the Earth may become too hot for life in only a billion years' time.

22,000,000,000

- Brad Larson's Big Rip theory predicts that the entire universe will eventually be progressively torn apart if the strength of dark energy increases with time. Small massless patches then collapse back into a single point renewing the Big Bang Cycle then causing it to explode out again renewing the universal cycle by its continual expansion. One hypothetical example of the theory places the end in approximately 22 billion years' time.
