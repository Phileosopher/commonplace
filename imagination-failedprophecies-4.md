COMING SOON!

2026

- According to The Church of !BLAIR!, humanity will probably be terminated at 3:28 AM (Soho, England time) on September 14, 2047. The church teaches that if humanity does not discard their plastic conformity, the Gods will withdraw their protection. The Gods don't want us to worship them; they don't want sacrifices or even offerings. They want us to rid itself of our excessive "Normalcy". At that point, Astro-Lemurs (extra-terrestrials similar in shape to lemurs, but with rainbow-colored bodies) will attack the entire human race and beat them to death with gigantic burritos.

2050

- An Australian think tank as of June 2019 claims that the world's ice sheets will collapse and humanity will cease to exist by 2050 if major pollution controls aren't set in place.

5,000,000,000

- It is widely accepted by the scientific community that the year 5 billion will be the end of our Sun's current phase of development, after which it will swell into a red giant, either swallowing the Earth or at least completely scorching it. However, as the Sun grows gradually hotter (over millions of years), the Earth may become too hot for life in only a billion years' time.

22,000,000,000

- Brad Larson's Big Rip theory predicts that the entire universe will eventually be progressively torn apart if the strength of dark energy increases with time. Small massless patches then collapse back into a single point renewing the Big Bang Cycle then causing it to explode out again renewing the universal cycle by its continual expansion. One hypothetical example of the theory places the end in approximately 22 billion years' time.

10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

- The heat death of the universe is a suggested final fate of the universe, in which the universe has diminished to a state of no thermodynamic free energy and therefore can no longer sustain motion or life.
