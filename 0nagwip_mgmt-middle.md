Middle management is the logical effect of a large management structure that needs more people to oversee workers.

Most middle managers "manage managers", and are often promoted into the role.

- Typically, they started as an entry-level worker, then gained a reputation in the company as a great worker and were promoted to oversee other workers, then eventually to oversee other managers.
- In larger organizations, this promotion ladder can move upward a few times (e.g., shift supervisor, general supervisor, district manager, regional manager, etc.).
- In particularly large organizations, most VP roles are glorified middle management roles.

The requirements to get *into* middle management are typically much harder than the requirements to actually do the job.

- The work itself typically involves getting status updates from subordinates, then condensing and sending those status updates to a higher manager.
- Most of your [decision-making](https://gainedin.site/decisions/) ability comes through permission you've been granted by *your* manager.
- To that end, most middle managers don't have much responsibility over what they do all day.

It's vastly difficult to define a high-quality middle manager for several reasons:

- Like [any other manager](/mgmt/), their performance is based on their *workers'* performance, which is already often difficult to measure in many job capacities itself.
- Their capacity to make decisions is hampered by what the company policy indicates, which they typically have zero control over.
- Performance metrics are very reliable to determine how someone does across time, but most executives track performance metrics against different managers on the same level, which disregards *every* variable which could be different.

Unfortunately, middle managers only exist in large groups, so middle managers can *only* exist within the natural inefficiencies that come from [large systems](https://gainedin.site/groups-large/).

- As the management ladder gets taller, managers show progressively less evidence of any individual contribution.
- Further, most people who are dramatically [successful](https://adequate.life/success-4/) will slowly leave their middle management role to find more [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) in a different role elsewhere.

Multiple tiers of middle managers *can* add value to a large organization, but only if a few criteria are *not* met:

- When middle managers are [technical idiots](/idiot/), they'll magnify the efforts of whoever leads them, since they don't know any better.
- If the power structure is *highly* formalized, with no room for discussion (e.g., a military), the middle manager is a redundant role as soon as higher management adopts better communication [technology](https://gainedin.site/technology/).

When individual contributions are easy to determine or completely irrelevant, a simple alternative to middle managers is a head communicator (e.g., "account manager", "project lead").

- By having someone relay information, there's no need for a middle manager, since the person themselves is held to that task.
- This *can* create more [chaos](https://gainedin.site/unknown/), especially when there are any [conflicts](https://adequate.life/conflicts/), but also gives people more responsibility (and therefore they'll find more [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) and be more [productive](https://adequate.life/success-4/)).
