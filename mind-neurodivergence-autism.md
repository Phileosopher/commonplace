# The basics of autism

A granular perspective, drawing stories from the bottom-up instead of the natural top-down view.

- Represented as a broad spectrum, ranging from high-functioning (aka "Asperger's symdrome") all the way down to nonverbal.
- Typically unable to see the "big picture" of things (i.e., "can't see the forest from the trees")
- Likely caused by *very* early childhood [PTSD](hardship-ptsd.md) before [language](language.md) could be implemented to make sense of their severe [feelings](mind-feelings.md) and sensations.

## Indicators

Poor body language and expression (though capable of processing the information they experience).

- Tendency to stare too much or avoid eye contact altogether
- Oblivious to personal space or implied messaging (e.g., not noticing you're signaling that you're leaving soon)
- Inapproprate laughing
- Trouble expressing needs, which may mean using nonverbal gestures
- Echoing words or phrases other people say

A general hyperfixation on specific subjects, lack of interest in other related subjects.

- General focus on [understanding](understanding.md) to the point of complete [certainty](understanding-certainty.md)
- Often over-certain regarding [unknown things](unknown.md)
- Repetitive playing and hobbies
- Uneven physical and verbal skills ("spiky skills")
- Inappropriate attachment to physical objects

This hyperfixation often disregards important aspects of [self-preservation](safety.md).

- No [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) of legitimate danger
- Apparent insensitivity to pain

They will also have trouble processing sensory information.

- May prefer to be alone
- Intermittent desire between physical contact and no-contact
- An insistence on things being the same
- Inappropriate or nonexistent response to sound

Autism is harder to diagnose as someone ages and develops better [masking skills](https://adequate.life/autistic/).

## How to behave with them

Take your time and spell things out, give as many details as they'd like

Don't rush them, and communicate as early as possible about *any* [changes](people-changes.md)

I've also created [an entire book how to work with them](https://adequate.life/autism/)

## The cure for it

There is no cure, as it is a neurological state of existence.

- However, the adverse effects of autism's high maintenance requirements can be dramatically when they have a sufficient social support system.

Socialization is critical, which can only safely happen within a community that can love and validate them.

- They will almost always thrive if they can find a productive [niche specialization](jobs-specialization.md) that matches a community's interests.
- Even without socialization, they can often find tremendous [meaning](meaning.md) through working within their preferred specializations.
