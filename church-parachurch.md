# List of parachurch organizations

As a general rule, most church leadership are at least somewhat territorial over [their congregation](mgmt-church.md).

- This is both an egregious reality (since we're *all* the Body of Christ if we share the same [core Gospel beliefs](https://theologos.site/gospel/)) and an unavoidable aspect of [human nature](humanity.md).

Therefore, the best way to find [cross-cultural](people-culture.md) connection across the Body is through parachurch organizations.

The organizations may die, but the [specializations](jobs-specialization.md) will carry on as long as there's a cross-cultural need and church leadership are territorial.

- It *is* worth noting that these groups aren't abstracted from denominational [bias](mind-bias.md): many of these organizations have their own statement of faith, and many of the leadership of the groups have a *clear* preference against some denominations.

This is not an exhaustive list, since I aim for quality over quantity and [other places have more exhaustive lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parachurch_organizations).

- If it's not here, it's simply likely I haven't heard of it or haven't verified it.
- However, if I *have* heard of it, and it has become [corrupted by the world](church-west.md) or believes in things against [sound Christian practices](spiritual-exercises.md), it's wiser to not advertise it.
- This is just a start, and there are *hundreds* of much smaller ministries that serve smaller regions and specializations.
- For the sake of brevity, this doesn't include the vast range of hospitals, museums, and fraternities and omits the denomination-specific entities that serve those larger denominations (e.g., the Roman Catholic Church's book publishing branch is probably larger than [many denominations](history-church.md)).

And, if the internet doesn't give a connection to a ministry in a group you think needs to exist, it may be time to [start your own ministry](mgmt-church.md).
