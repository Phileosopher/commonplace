*Previous: [What is a Manager?](/mgmt/)*

There are two ways to imagine and plan for a project:

1. Assembly - imagine the manifold tasks necessary to perform the project, then work upward into a grander purpose.
2. Work Backward - have a grander purpose, then work backward into the necessary manifold tasks.

When it's possible, the first is ideal.

- It needs to have been proven elsewhere.
- The project can't be beyond a humanly comprehensible amount of complexity.
- The tasks need to be clearly defined.

The second, however, can be used universally.

- All you need is a vision, even if it's not possible.
- When the situation proves the project impossible to achieve, you *will* need to move the project goals.
- Moving project goals requires both [mental flexibility to change](https://gainedin.site/change/) and the social skills to [influence others](https://adequate.life/people-3) to new truths.

## A. Have a vision

Before even *beginning* to dive into [teams](/mgmt-teams/) and [projects](/mgmt-projects/), build a clear [vision](https://gainedin.site/imagination/) of what the team will need to do:

- Will the project have many interconnected tasks (and require more [communication](https://adequate.life/speaking/)) or are each of the tasks relatively independent of each other?
- Is the task relatively straightforward, or more abstract?
- What qualitatively or quantitatively defines if the project is a success or failure?
- What rewards will the members receive if they do well at the project?

Reflect your vision with your lifestyle.

- Your own way of life should reflect on the projects and goals you're aspiring to achieve.
- Associate with other people who constantly [challenge](https://gainedin.site/conflicts/) your ideas.
- Stay [creative](https://gainedin.site/creativity/), and continually seek out new experiences and new ways to see the world.
- If you don't constantly seek new information and points of view, your group will [influence](https://gainedin.site/influence/) you enough that you'll become stagnant through a leader-member [cultural](https://gainedin.site/culture/) feedback loop.

## B. Establish values

With that idea in place, clarify the values you want to see with your workers.

- These values are [philosophical concepts](https://gainedin.site/values/) that take precedence over others (e.g., kindness, strength, curiosity).
- Your values will then resonate with the 3 R's:
  1. Recruit - selecting people who share those values.
  2. Reward - promoting people who reflect those values.
  3. Release - letting go of people who *don't* share those values.
- Closely consider the [story](https://gainedin.site/stories/) of the group and where it came from, since that determines where it'll go next.

Clarify any critical [customs](https://adequate.life/social-rules/) or [habits](https://gainedin.site/habits/) that will reinforce those values.

- You're trying to foster a [culture](https://gainedin.site/culture/) which reinforces the values you believe should show themselves.
- If your team has any [creative](https://gainedin.site/creativity/) people, the best cultural values you can introduce are *extremely* simple, with the expectation that they will find [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) in adding their own flair to it out of boredom.

## C. Pick a system

There are a variety of existing project systems to choose from, and even more if you draw inspiration from [logistics](/logistics/).

Areas of Operation (AOs):

- The system divides out the roles and responsibilities to specific individuals:
  1. Designate sub-leaders who are exclusively responsible for specific, non-overlapping domains.
     - The domains can be contiguous (shares a boundary with other sub-leaders) or non-contiguous (not sharing a boundary).
  2. That sub-leader is responsible for that domain, and their management performance is defined by their results.
     - If any members fail, that sub-leader is exclusively responsible.
- While the system works *very* well for clearly defined goals with clearly-defined actions (e.g., military activities), it's very inflexible to changes and doesn't accommodate the individuals' situations or ideas.

The Waterfall Model:

- The system step-by-step sequence across 5 phases to carry the project to completion:
  1. Requirements - outline the high-level conditions that determine a project's success.
  2. Design - create solutions that meet the requirements, often considering backup plans as well.
  3. Implementation - pick a design and use [technology](https://gainedin.site/technology/) to apply it.
  4. Verification - test whether the implementation worked.
  5. Maintenance - keep testing and [fixing anything that breaks](/fix/).
- It requires specific goals from the very beginning.
  - It works on hard deadlines and treats every task as "final".
  - Any failures from previous process steps roll into later process tasks.
- This system doesn't handle unexpected problems very well.

Objectives and Key Results (OKR):

- The system is designed to achieve clearly-understood purposes:
  1. Make an objective that is significant, concrete, and clearly defined.
     - Further, the objectives should inspire everyone working toward them.
     - Avoid a "business as usual" attitude, which means avoiding vague words like "help" and "consult".
  2. Each objective should have 3-5 key results, which are measurable either as 0-100% or a numerical value.
     - Aim to measure leading indicators (readily measurable things) instead of lagging indicators (things that measure after a lead time).
     - The target success rate for key results should be 70%, since it encourages competitive goal-making.
     - If the key results are consistently hit at 100%, they should be re-evaluated.
  3. If necessary, objectives can be supported by initiatives, which are plans and activities that help move forward the objectives and key results.
- One of the downsides of the system is that on the individual level the entire project simply looks like a task list, which makes it very easy for managers to conflate OKRs with performance reviews.

Agile Methodology:

- The system is designed for when project goals aren't entirely clear:
  1. Break the project into sub-projects, called "sprints".
  2. At the end of a sprint, everyone reviews the work and makes adjustments for the next sprint.
  3. In difficulties come in the middle of a sprint, make smaller sub-projects within that sprint with newer, smaller goals.
  4. Repeat until complete.
- The original idea was from [software development](https://trendless.tech/prog-basics/), where the goals and possible risks aren't always perfectly clear.
  - The system revises every development stage as the situation changes.
  - Other variations of Agile like [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) or [Lean](https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/) add more structure.

Holacracy:

- [The system](https://www.holacracy.org/) is a very flat management structure designed around a constitution made of 5 modules, which everyone is expected to follow:
  1. Organizational structure
     - Defines an exact format for roles, responsibilities, and rules.
  2. Rules of cooperation
     - Defines what everyone should expect from each other.
     - Clarifies duties involving everyone being transparent with each other, how they process others' requests, and how everyone should prioritize work.
  3. Tactical meetings
     - Gives specific standards for how to run meetings and keep them efficient.
     - Also prevents from anyone dominating the meeting or distractions about unrelated discussions.
  4. Distributed authority
     - Speeds tasks up by granting partial autonomy without needing prior approval.
     - Creates constraints to prevent abuse of that autonomy.
  5. Decentralized governance process
     - Creates a process for making improvements or changes within the scope of each person's work.
     - Gives limits to prevent anyone abusing the governance process.
- The system gives everyone power to self-manage, which is a very effective system if everyone is trustworthy to self-direct.
  - If everyone depends heavily on each other, though, it can cause severe breakdowns in communications and activities and be *worse* than micromanagement.

## D. Clarify constraints

Every project has specific purposes and constraints:

- You should know *why* every project, as well as projects connected to them, exist.
- Stay aware of the project's final deadline, along with what a perfect project completion would look like.
- Track how much everything will likely cost, the existing [budget](https://adequate.life/money-3/), and the consequences for going over budget.

After all that, examine the space you're working in.

- Consider the location and how it'll connect to the culture and work environment.

Make a thorough list of *all* the software, equipment, tools, and supplies everyone will possibly need for the work.

- You're trying to gather as much information as possible, which will create the ceiling of the necessary resource load.

Consider the project's necessary inputs and outputs:

- Money
- Hours
- Required research
- Ideas
- If it's a [creative](https://gainedin.site/creativity/) project, the story points, outlines, and key ideas
- If it's [marketing](/marketing/)-based, sales strategies and closed leads
- If it's working with many people, required plans of action for specific events
- If it uses technology, whether it needs [tech management](https://trendless.tech/mgmt/), [existing code](https://trendless.tech/version-control/) or [documentation](https://trendless.tech/documentation/)

## E. Make plans

[Make goals](https://adequate.life/success-3/) that clearly indicate *exactly* what you want.

- The goals should have a clear [logistical methodology](/logistics/) and be legitimately attainable.

Consider all available resources, including more abstract ones:

- Available people
- Ideas
- Positional and temporary advantages
- From a [different perspective](https://adequate.life/creativity/), most risks can actually be advantages (e.g., [unemployment](https://adequate.life/unemployment/) creates available free time).

Start with the larger [goals](https://adequate.life/success-3/), then split them into smaller ones.

1. Clearly get your mind around the goals.
   - Write out each objective and what you expect of it as a 250-word paragraph.
   - Set measurable numbers to track each objective.
2. Divide the goals into future periods.
   - Annual objectives are *extremely* large-scale and necessary for long-term planning.
   - Quarterly objectives divide out annual objectives.
   - Monthly and weekly objectives are focused on accomplishing quarterly results.
   - If you have a difficult time imagining 12 months in the future, simply think 3 months out and then extrapolate it 4 times.
3. Make schedules for both a worst-case and best-case scenario.
   - The actual schedule will likely be near the middle.
4. At each interval, update the short-term goals and timing for all future objectives.
   - It can help to track previous periods' projections versus results to better estimate the numbers.
5. Every quarter, compile a summary of achieved objectives.
   - For each objective, write a paragraph articulating whether you achieved it any what everyone learned.
   - Include metrics that most clearly indicate where the group struggled or thrived.
   - Describe precisely how the events happened, as well as how the organization could have done better or continue succeeding.
6. Every year, estimate the next year.
   - The outline of next year's annual report are the previous year's objectives.

## F. Take extra time For human resources

A team of people is more like a small community than any type of system.

- Each person will interact with other people, creating a [group culture](https://gainedin.site/culture/) that frames it as a unique entity.
- Across teams, an organization is more like an ecosystem than a formal structure.

The team's composition adapts further constraints and opportunities:

- Look at everyone's roles and responsibilities, including what people believe about [who is *really* in charge](https://gainedin.site/power-types/).
- There's usually a maximum [logistical](/logistics/) limit for how often each member is able to meet.

If you've inherited a prior project and team, you're walking into a new culture and your presence will create a ripple to how everyone does things.

- Have a transition [speech](https://adequate.life/speaking/) prepared that will quickly and precisely articulate how you're similar and different from the prior manager.
  - If you don't *know* how the prior manager was, openly ask the members how they used to do everything.
  - Do *not* presume that the way you did things elsewhere applies here: even highly rigid systems can easily have permutations in [how things get done](https://gainedin.site/habits/).
- Your [natural disposition](https://gainedin.site/personality/) to favor anyone differently than the last manager is guaranteed to create workplace politics.
- Most of the group will *not* adapt quickly to your approach, but the ones who do may simply be [power-hungry](https://gainedin.site/power/).
