# Christianity's compatibility with philosophy - part 2

## Axiology: How do we find purpose?

It's entirely possible to have a meaningless form of Christianity, though it's not recommended:

- **Absurdism** is difficult to justify, since God designed the universe for us and it is literally *designed* to give us purposes.
- **Nihilism** is also possible, but sabotages the implicit meaning of God's design.
  - **Fatalism**, in particular, is only possible with Christian doctrine if we see God's omniscience as taking away the value of our [agency](people-decisions.md).

**Anthropomorphism** is acceptable, and in some ways *encouraged* by God (i.e., the Bible refers to God's "hands", God's pronoun is a "him/he").

To an extent, **egoism's descriptive aspects** (and both **cynicism** and **psychological egoism**) is true (i.e., our sin condition), but it can't be all-inclusive or there would be no hope for humanity's moral redemption.

As a derivative of humanism, **Freudianism** is possible, but never directly addresses our moral condition correctly.

**Hedonism** must be fundamentally true as a description of our pleasure-seeking design.

### The verdict on how we find purpose

True

- Hedonism

Possible (or partial)

- Anthropomorphism

Possible (but difficult)

- Absurdism
- Egoism (outside of what God does)
  - Cynicism
  - Psychological egoism
- Freudianism
- Nihilism
  - Fatalism

## Axiology: Where *should* we place our purposes?

In Christianity, **amor fati** is all depending on perspective:

- Knowing that God is ultimately in control should give us some degree of closure.
- However, the value system goes too far when it minimizes the emotional realities of present hardships.

**Anthropocentrism** is a fundamental belief of Christianity, with the idea that the universe is all designed for man's relationship with God.

Christianity conforms to **immortalism**, even including nearly every doctrine of hell (since eternal destruction would mean never actually being destroyed).

While **pragmatism** can exist, it doesn't serve as a greater place than what God wants.

**Teleologism** can affect Christianity profoundly through the understanding that God designs everything *very* cleverly with a purpose.

### The verdict on where we should place our purposes

True

- Immortalism

Possible (or partial)

- Amor fati
- Anthropocentrism (if it's about man's relationship with God, and not just man)
- Pragmatism
- Teleologism

## Axiology: How should we gain knowledge?

Since our [certainty](understanding-certainty.md) can never be complete (given our fallen state and God's commands to trust Him), the approach in Scripture to gaining knowledge is somewhat unimportant by comparison:

- **Coherentism** and **foundationalism** are both fine, though good theology leans toward foundationalism.
  - However, in some ways, **functionalism** may have more merit, simply because it leans against reductive materialism and logical behaviorism.
- **Critical rationalism** (along with **falsificationism**) has merit, since even science [science](science.md) can't fully validate our understanding.
  - However, **pancritical rationalism** goes too far, since it interferes with God's direct authority.
- **Logical positivism** has some use, but could be regarded as a waste of time, and makes **comtism** is a *complete* waste of time.

**Deism** can't work because the basis for knowledge comes *at least* partly through God's inspiration.

**Experientialism** can be validated in some ways (e.g., [Luke 1:3-4](https://biblehub.com/luke/1.htm)).

**Inductionism** has enough Scripture to indicate it's at least partly true (especially in [Proverbs](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1.htm)), but it can't be complete.

- **Inductivism** and **scientism** can't be true due to our fallen state affecting the scientific community.
- **Psychologism** is likely untrue unless we define Scripture as a type of philosophical study.

**Instrumentalism** has some degree of truth to it, simply because love is materially more important than truth.

**Irrealism** doesn't work because it sits on the presumption of physicalism having value.

**Kierkegaardianism** is possible, but takes a *lot* of work and requires being very smart.

**Occamism (Occam's razor)** has a *ton* of use, and is often the role of most [church leadership](mgmt-church.md).

- Further, many [modern churches](history-church.md) have proven **greedy reductionism**, *especially* on critical doctrinal issues.

**Phenomenal conservatism** must necessarily be true regarding God, though it doesn't always extend to society (e.g., being "shrewd as serpents" in [Matthew 10:16](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm)).

**Skepticism** (and the domains of **postmodernism**, **probabiliorism**, **probabilism**, and **pyrrhonism**) is *very* difficult to harmonize with Christianity, since it alienates the general nature of God's design for the universe.

Implicitly, Christians do believe a form of **structuralism** within [God's ultimate plans](https://theologos.site/god-sight/).

Believing in absolute truth defies **subjectivism**, and by implication **post-structuralism**.

**Syncretism** is a *very* common reality within Christianity, in many directions, with the most prevalent one being the base concept of being "[born again](jesus-gospel.md)".

### The verdict on how we should gain knowledge

True

- Structuralism
- Syncretism

Possible (and useful)

- Inductionism
- Occam's razor
  - Greedy reductionism
- Phenomenal conservatism (with respect to God)

Possible (or partial)

- Falsificationism
- Foundationalism
- Functionalism
- Instrumentalism
- Logical positivism

Possible (but difficult)

- Comtism
- Kierkegaardianism
- Phenomenal conservatism (with respect to anything *but* God)
- Psychologism
- Skepticism
  - Postmodernism
  - Probabiliorism
  - Probabilism
  - Pyrrhonism

False

- Deism
- Pancritical rationalism
- Inductivism
- Irrealism
- Scientism
- Subjectivism
- Post-structuralism

## Axiology: What is the most moral thing to do (greatest good)?

A relationship with Jesus is portrayed directly as a form of *very* personal **mysticism**.

- *All* Christians convert by accepting a form of **defeatism** about our moral state.
- To even acknowledge that defeatism, they must accept some level of **objectivism** (at least with how God sees it).
- To follow Jesus is to accept a form of **altruism** (and **collectivism**, to some degree) as a directive on how to live.
- The altruism in Christ also happens to be a *very* radical and specific form of **pacifism**.

Some ideas are *possible*, but don't capture the spirit of Scripture:

- **Antinatalism** (particularly with [leftward thinking](politics-leftism.md)) is possible, but difficult to validate in light of God's love for humanity (and desire for more people as a logical product of it).
- **Antinominianism** is possible due to the scope of Jesus' sacrifice, but it misses Jesus' general directive to "go and sin no more" ([John 8:11](https://biblehub.com/john/8-11.htm)).
- **Asceticism** is possible to conclude, though it has been taken too far (e.g., [1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm)).

The call to Christ has an implicit opposition to *all* **ethical egoism**.

- To a lesser extent, it's *very* difficult to uphold **careerism**, **consumerism**, and **emotionalism**.

Christianity *could* be classified as a type of **ethical hedonism**, with the joy derived from a relationship with God being the greatest good.

- However, it can't be the highest end, which makes most implementations of **Epicureanism** far too extreme.
- In a sense conformity to God's standards is a type of **utilitarianism**, though it requires justifying the calculation as being beyond our understanding.
- Further, if the Body of Christ is a [new adoptive family](church-family.md), there is an aspect of **role ethics**.

Since Christianity opposes naturalism, **humanistic naturalism** can't be consistent with it.

The certainty of Scripture and God's commands makes **immoralism** impossible.

Since God's divine inspiration is the best way to gain understanding, **intellectualism** is difficult to maintain without defining divine inspiration as part of our reasoning.

Christianity has a type of **irrationalism** (through the understanding of divine inspiration), but doesn't go far enough that it completely dismisses the value of reasoning.

Strong Christians often adopt a form of **perfectionism** (such as the idea of [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md)).

Following Jesus requires a humble attitude driven toward love for others, so both **Randianism** and **Stoicism** are entirely *possible*, but difficult to harmonize.

### The verdict on the most moral thing to do

True

- Altruism
- Defeatism
- Mysticism
- Objectivism
- Pacifism

Possible (and useful)

- Collectivism
- Hedonism
- Perfectionism
- Role ethics

Possible (or partial)

- Asceticism
- Irrationalism
- Utilitarianism

Possible (but difficult)

- Antinatalism
- Antinomianism
- Careerism
- Consumerism
- Emotionalism
- Epicureanism
- Intellectualism
- Randianism
- Stoicism

False

- Egoism
- Humanistic naturalism
- Immoralism

## Axiology: Do we have free will?

*Some* Christians believe in **incompatibilism**, but most Christians believe a form of **compatibilism/soft determinism**.

- Many Christians also advance **open theism**.
- A few Christian sects assert a type of **metaphysical libertarianism**.

**Personalism** is also entirely possible without any issues.

### The verdict on free will

Possible (and useful)

- Compatibilism/soft determinism
- Open theism

Possible (or partial)

- Incompatibilism
- Libertarianism
- Personalism

## Axiology: How can mankind be morally saved by an all-knowing God?

In **soteriology**, multiple doctrines can be at least mostly consistent with Scripture:

- **Arminianism** and **Calvinism** are mostly the same, but hinge heavily on whether people can resist God's calling.
- **Molinism** is possible for Christians, and even *likely* in many doctrines of the Trinity.
- **Fideism** makes a hard distinction between faith and reasoning.

**Pelagianism** can be justified, but needs a bit more criteria to clarify it, but has been regarded as heresy by the Christian church at large.

- **Semipelagianism** is a hybrid, and therefore a little easier to work with, but has many of the same issues.

**Gnosticism** isn't possible for Christianity, since it takes away from the simple directive to believe in Jesus.

### The verdict on how salvation happens with God's omniscience

True

- Soteriology

Possible (and useful)

- Molinism

Possible (or partial)

- Arminianism
- Calvinism
- Fideism

Possible (but difficult)

- Pelagianism
  - Semipelagianism

False

- Gnosticism

## Aesthetics: What should we define as quality?

**Aestheticism** can be very true in Christianity, particularly if a relationship with God is not built inherently on a [purpose](purpose.md) but instead on an essence.

While **aesthetic formalism** has merit, it goes too far if it straddles into someone's ethical issues with a social or historical context.

**Romanticism** has value until it becomes an ethical consideration.

### The verdict on what we should define as quality

Possible (and useful)

- Aestheticism

Possible (or partial)

- Aesthetic formalism (until it defiles another's conscience)
- Romanticism (until it becomes an ethical matter)

## Aesthetics: How should we [create](mind-creativity.md)?

It's hard to *not* argue that God's divinely inspired [creations](creations.md) are performed via **automatism**, and worth considering in light of [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md).

**Classicism** is a *huge* aspect of Christian tradition, especially with respect to art.

In a sense, creating without a focus on God can be risky, and **modernism** and **primitivism** can create adverse consequences when not merged with other values.

While creating against the essence of order can magnify the human experience, there's a "middle ground" in the domains of **expressionism**, **surrealism**, and **symbolism** that avoids detracting from God's glory.

### The verdict on how we should create

True

- Automatism (for Scripture)

Possible (and useful)

- Automatism (for everything we make)
- Classicism

Possible (or partial)

- Expressionism
- Surrealism
- Symbolism

Possible (but difficult)

- Modernism
- Primitivism

False

## Ethics

Both **cognitivism** and **moral realism** have merit, but can be sidestepped if God *is* morality incarnate (which can remove any reasoning we could make that navigates elements of it).

- On the other hand, **non-cognitivism** can't be true, since Christian doctrine draws a hard connection between ethical statements and truth.
- **Expressivism** may have some truth to it, but it's difficult to conceptualize in a Christian framing.

There's plenty of room for **emotivism** and **universal prescriptivism**.

There is room for **quasi-realism**, but it can't go so far that it defines *all* ethics as being purely emotional.

In many ways, Christian thinking embodies **value pluralism** directly, especially with respect to domains involving the Old vs. New Covenant.

### The verdict on how we should position our ethics

Possible (or partial)

- Cognitivism
  - Moral realism
- Emotivism
  - Universal prescriptivism
- Quasi-realism (as long as it's not complete)
- Value pluralism

Possible (but difficult)

- Expressivism

False

- Non-cognitivism

## Ethics: Why are things good or bad?

**Ascriptivism** is an inherent requirement to accept we are responsible for our sin, which is a requirement to accepting Christ's sacrifice.

**Consequentialism** (along with **eudaimonism** and **situational ethics**) is generally *not* true, except regarding what God can do (i.e., God's consequences are righteous).

- **Non-consequentialism** is *generally* true (i.e., follow God's directives).
  - In some ways it can adopt flavors of **extrinsicism** or **Kantianism**, but easily diverges when the motivation becomes love for God and others.

Most aspects of **humanism** *can* dovetail with Christianity, but will create dangerously dysfunctional theologies.

- **Meliorism** takes away from what God can do, implying people can rise to something beyond themselves.
- **Posthumanism** removes *any* greater [meaning](meaning.md) that God has for humanity.
- **Secular humanism** implies that our development is better without God being involved.
- While **transcendentalism** and **neo-Platonism** sound fine within a Christian context, they imply that mankind can self-promote themselves through some form of understanding or spirituality (which goes against the Christian doctrines of defeatism).
  - **Transhumanism**, along with **extropianism** and **singularitarianism**, imply transcendentalism, but through [science](science.md) and [technology](technology.md).
- **Religious humanism** and **Christian humanism** try to split the strong difference between humanism and Christianity, which severely dilutes anything legitimately Christian about it.

Christianity emphasizes **moral absolutism** (and therefore a type of **moral universalism**) based on God's perspective, which sabotages any hope for **moral relativism**.

### The verdict on why things are good or bad

True

- Ascriptivism
- Moral absolutism

Possible (or partial)

- Moral universalism
- Non-consequentialism
  - Extrinsicism
  - Kantianism

Possible (but difficult)

- Consequentialism (except for God)
  - Eudaimonism
  - Situational ethics
- Humanism (in every one of its forms)

False

- Moral relativism
