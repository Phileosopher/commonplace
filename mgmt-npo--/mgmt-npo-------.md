#### OpenAI ownership - Matt Levine

The normal way to own a share of a company's profits is to buy its stock. If you find a company that you think is promising, and you want to give it some money to finance its operations in exchange for a share of its profits, you might buy, say, 10% of its stock, and then in some rough sense you own 10% of its future profits. Not in any very strict sense - the company gets the profits, and may or may not pay some or all of them out to you as dividends - but people do tend to think of a share of stock as a share in future profits.

But while stock is the _standard_ way to buy a share of a company's profits, it is not the only way. Here's another one: _I_ buy 10% of the company's stock, and then I write you a total return swap, a derivative contract saying that I'll pay you $1 for every $1 that the stock goes up (and you'll pay me $1 for every $1 it goes down). That way, you have economic exposure to the stock: You make money if it goes up and lose money if it goes down. But you don't own the actual shares of stock, or some of the rights that attach to them. (You normally can't vote for directors, for instance.) You have economic ownership of the stock, but you don't actually own stock.

There are other ways. Many crypto tokens, for instance, are _kind of_ profit interests in some project. Or more simply, you go to the company and say "hey I'd like to buy 10% of your profits" and the company says "sure" and writes a contract saying "you are entitled to 10% of our profits." And then when the company has profits it writes you a quarterly check.

Why would you do any of these things, instead of buying stock? Here are three possible answers:

1. You arrived from Mars 10 minutes ago, you have never heard of "common stock," so you reason from first principles about how to invest in a company and take a share of its profits. "What if we wrote some sort of a contract giving me a share of the profits," you say, etc. 
2. The company is not actually a company and doesn't have stock, so you need to resort to workarounds. You want to give money to a university lab, or a government project, or a nonprofit organization, or your brother-in-law, to develop some commercial thing, and in exchange you want 10% of the commercial thing's profits. Maybe you write a profit-sharing contract. Or you want to invest money in a decentralized crypto project, and you take back tokens that seem likely to go up if it succeeds.
3. Regulatory arbitrage. Because stock is the normal way to own a share of a company's profits, a lot of _rules_ apply to stock, and if you buy something that is Not Stock you might avoid those rules, while still getting the benefits (profit sharing, etc.) of stock. For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has a lot of disclosure and other rules that apply to people who buy [more than 5%](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-04-06/elon-musk-is-active-now) of a public company's stock; some investors want to avoid those disclosure rules for various reasons, so they will use total return swaps or other derivatives rather than buying stock directly. (There is a cat-and-mouse element to this, where people use swaps to avoid the rules, so the SEC [revises the rules to capture swaps](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-24/the-sec-wants-to-stop-activism).) Or there are margin rules limiting how much money you can _borrow_ to buy stocks, while the rules for derivatives can be laxer. (This is part of what went wrong with [Archegos Capital Management](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-29/archegos-was-too-busy-for-margin-calls).) Or US antitrust law [requires regulatory preapproval](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/competition-matters/2023/02/hsr-threshold-adjustments-reportability-2023) for anyone buying more than a certain amount of a company's stock; buying Not Stock can avoid those rules too. 

Reason 1 is fun but, I think, rarely applies. But we have [talked](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-20/who-controls-openai) a [lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-21/openai-is-a-strange-nonprofit) [recently](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-27/openai-is-still-an-86-billion-nonprofit) about the drama and corporate structure of OpenAI, which is technically a nonprofit, but which has taken billions of dollars from Microsoft Corp. and other investors in exchange for (capped) participation in the profits of its for-profit (uh, [capped-profit](https://www.thediff.co/archive/why-is-openai-financed-that-way/)) subsidiary. Basically OpenAI's strategy is to take Microsoft's money, use it to build chatbots and other sort-of-artificial-intelligence tools, make many billions of dollars from the chatbots, use some of the money to pay Microsoft a lavish return on its investment, use the rest to build artificial general intelligence, and then use artificial general intelligence "for the benefit of humanity," rather than for the benefit of Microsoft.

OpenAI seems to be [worth $86 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-27/openai-is-still-an-86-billion-nonprofit), and I have [joked that](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-21/openai-is-a-strange-nonprofit) "as far as I can tell no one in human history has ever purchased shares in a nonprofit at an $86 billion valuation," but that was just a shorthand, and Microsoft _didn't_ purchase shares in OpenAI, or not exactly. It bought a capped profit interest in OpenAI's capped-profit subsidiary?

Part of this is for Reason 2: OpenAI is a nonprofit, it has unusual goals, and it is pursuing those goals with an unusual profit-sharing mechanism rather than with normal stock.

But part of it is for Reason 3, regulatory arbitrage. [Bloomberg's Dina Bass and Leah Nylen report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-08/microsoft-s-answer-to-openai-inquiry-it-doesn-t-own-a-stake):

> With global regulators examining Microsoft Corp.'s $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the software giant has a simple argument it hopes will resonate with antitrust officials: It doesn't own a traditional stake in the buzzy startup so can't be said to control it.
>
> When Microsoft negotiated an additional $10 billion investment in OpenAI in January, it opted for an unusual arrangement, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Rather than buy a chunk of the cutting-edge artificial intelligence lab, it cut a deal to receive almost half of OpenAI's financial returns until the investment is repaid up to a pre-determined cap, one of the people said. The unorthodox structure was concocted because OpenAI is a capped for-profit company housed inside a non-profit organization.

> It's not clear regulators see a distinction, however. On Friday the UK Competition and Markets Authority said it was gathering information from stakeholders to determine whether the collaboration between the two firms threatens competition in the UK, home of Google's AI research lab Deepmind. The US Federal Trade Commission is also examining the nature of Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and whether it may violate antitrust laws, according to a person familiar with the matter. …
>
> Microsoft didn't report the transaction to the agency because the investment in OpenAI doesn't amount to control of the company under US law, the person said. OpenAI is a non-profit and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren't reported under US merger law, regardless of value. Agency officials are analyzing the situation and assessing what its options are.

> "While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to a share of profit distributions," a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. 

Sure. Ownership of a company consists _mainly_ of being entitled to a share of profit distributions, but not _only_ that; ownership does often ([not always](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-07-11/investors-gave-snap-a-gift)) come with, for instance, voting rights. Microsoft has isolated the profit share and taken only that, not actual ownership. Okay fine and also a [board observer seat](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-board-takes-over-and-says-microsoft-will-have-observer-role-50e55b73). 

"It's not clear regulators see a distinction," or that they should really. The conceptual overlap between "owning a portion of OpenAI" and "being entitled to a share of profit distributions" is not perfect, but it is large, and a regulator might reasonably say "close enough."

Also here is a small fun fact about this distinction. When I [wrote about OpenAI](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-20/who-controls-openai) last month, I included this organizational chart from its own website:

I clipped that chart from the website myself, on Nov. 19, though I circled "Minority owner" in blue for this post. I went back to [the website](https://openai.com/our-structure) yesterday to check, and found this _slightly different_ chart:

See the difference? Again, I took the liberty of circling it in blue. I do not know the details of Microsoft's contractual arrangement with OpenAI, or if they have changed since November. But in November, OpenAI's website said that Microsoft was a "minority owner" of its capped-profit subsidiary. In December, when "it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI," the website says it has a "minority economic interest." You can see how people might confuse those things, since OpenAI did.

One other thing I should say is that [here is a claim](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/openai-compensation.html) that OpenAI's _employees_ get a capped profit interest instead of stock (or stock options, or restricted stock units), because of its nonprofit structure, and that this profit interest gets better _tax treatment_, for them, than standard startup equity awards:

> People receiving profit interests will be granted the units upon their vesting date at no additional cost. Because of that, there's an additional key tax benefit in that they are tax-free upon issuance and vesting, so the only tax hit would be a capital gains tax when the profit is received or sold.
>
> In contrast, with a traditional Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) that you'd see at a MAANG level company, when the RSU vests, an employee will be taxed upon receiving their RSUs immediately. This is because the RSU is essentially a percentage of equity in the company and holds a value at whatever the market rate is for that company's stock.

Regulatory arbitrage everywhere!
