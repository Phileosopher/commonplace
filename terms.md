# Terms and Conditions

NOTE: These are my terms and conditions to demonstrate several points at once:

1. I want to be [legally safe](legal-safety.md) as a service provider and essayist.
2. I wish to [educate](education.md) people on how straightforward legality can be when parsed correctly.
3. [Legally substantial](legal-doctrines.md) information does *not* need arbitrary complexity and *can* be [designed](engineering-design.md) for ease-of-use, though law school takes enough work that [it makes sense to obfuscate it](mgmt-badsystems.md).

This was parsed from selecting elements at [PrivacyPolicies.com](https://app.privacypolicies.com/) with modified language to fit my situation, then simplified. I'm not a lawyer and don't make enough money to hire one, so this represents the scope of my [risk management](safety-riskmgmt.md) for most typical use cases.

Please also consult related policies of service providers I use:

- LiteSpeed Cache - <https://quic.cloud/privacy-policy/>
- WordPress - <https://automattic.com/privacy/> and <https://wordpress.com/tos/>

If you wish to take any action, you must contact me first about any discrepancies between these terms and that policy, and give me enough time to take timely action.

The Service may contain views and opinions which are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any other author, agency, organization, employer or company, including Me. The information in the Service is borrowed from other sources, and does not represent truth simply because it was written.

In a situation where the information would represent as libelous, I have provided exculpatory obfuscation to protect the potentially injured parties.

## Scope of My License

As a matter of ethics, I find advertisements an impediment to the user experience. If My Service provides intrusive advertisements, for any reason whatsoever, I am not liable for them.

- transactions through a third-party vendor

I also may offer subscription plans for a fee. By purchasing a subscription, You agree to both an initial and recurring subscription fee at the then-current rate and interval, and You accept all responsibility for all recurring charges until You cancel Your subscription. You may cancel your subscription at any time, subject to the Your Order Cancellation Rights section.

From time to time, I may offer free or discounted items as part of my Service. The terms of those promotions will supersede the terms of this Agreement, when applicable.

I have the right to maintain termination of Your use of the Service for as long as I deem necessary.

Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately, without any required prior notice from Me, in the event that you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

You may also terminate this Agreement by deleting the Service completely from Your Device.

Upon termination of this Agreement, You shall cease all use of the Service and delete all copies of the Service from Your Device.

Termination of this Agreement will not limit My rights or remedies at law or in equity in case You have breached (during the term of this Agreement) any of Your obligations under the present Agreement.

## Conflict Resolution Procedures

If you cannot document an interaction with Me, You cannot engage in a formal action against Me.

## Your Order Cancellation Rights

You are entitled to cancel Your Order within 45 days without giving any reason for doing so.

The deadline for cancelling an Order is 45 days from the date You received the Goods or a third party you have appointed (who is not the carrier) takes possession of the Good delivered. For subscriptions, the deadline is 30 days.

To exercise Your right of cancellation, You must inform Me of Your decision by means of a clear statement. The statement must indicate whether you want a refund or a replacement of the Goods. You can inform Me of Your decision via the Contact Me section below.

I will reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day I receive the returned Goods. I will use the same means of payment as You used for the Order if possible, and You will not incur any fees for the reimbursement.

### Conditions for Returns

For Goods to be eligible for a return, make sure that:

- The Goods were purchased in the last 45 days.
- The Goods are in the original packaging.
- The Goods have their receipt or proof of purchase.

The following Goods cannot be returned:

- Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.
- Goods which are not suitable to be returned according to their nature, deteriorate rapidly or where the expiration date is past.
- Goods due to health protection or hygiene reasons are not suitable for return and were unsealed after delivery.
- Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items.
- Goods which were on clearance or discontinued.

I reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the above return conditions in My sole discretion.

Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale will only be refunded at My discretion. This exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.

### Returning Goods

You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Me. Please contact Me for further instruction about where You should send the Goods.

I cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, I recommend an insured and trackable mail service. I am unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the Goods or proof of received return delivery.

### Gifts

If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll receive a gift credit for the value of Your return. Once the returned product is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to You.

If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later, I will send the refund to the gift giver.

## Entire Agreement

The Agreement as stated above constitutes the entire agreement between You and Me regarding Your use of My Services and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between You and Me.

You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that apply when You use or purchase My other services, which I will provide to You at the time of that other service's use or purchase.

If a revision is material I will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect, but I cannot guarantee or provide warranty of said notice.

You are advised to review this Agreement periodically for any changes. Changes to this Agreement are effective when they are posted on this page.

By continuing to access or use the Service after any revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, You are no longer authorized to use the Application.

### Severability and Waiver
