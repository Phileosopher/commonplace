## Reputation

A person's reputation is the composite of everyone else's [image](image.md) of that person. It's extremely fickle and chaotic because it's what other people [feel](mind-feelings.md) about someone, which changes constantly.

All reputation is nothing but [sentiments](mind-feelings.md) about past events. Those sentiments, however, are [powerful](power.md), and define entire [cultures](culture.md).

Because reputation is built around feelings, it's rarely [rational](logic.md). At its farthest extreme, a celebrity will make one social media remark that generates 1,500 comments, with each person feeling their single comment will [make a difference](power-influence.md).

Reputations prove beforehand to others about what they should [expect](imagination.md). It usually indicates what someone [has legitimately done](mind-creativity-results.md) and implies how much they [understand](understanding.md). While a reputation is always interpersonal, a sufficiently advanced society will create a set of data-generated reputations in different domains (e.g., [credit score](money-2_debt.md), [insurance score](insurance.md)).

The limit of [power](power.md) from a reputation is what that entire [group](groups-large.md) can provide, so most people [pursue](purpose.md) at least some reputation with others.

To [communicate](language.md) a reputational image is *highly* contextual and will bestow honor or shame on a person depending on the situation. Most of the value people feel from their honor and shame comes through a third party observing it, which is why [group leaders](groups-small.md) have more [power](power.md) to bestow honor and shame than [members](groups-member.md).

To be famous is to have so much attention on you that you have no medium to sufficiently respond to the people who [communicate with you](people-conversation.md).

Discrimination
--------------

When we interpret favor or shame immediately as part of our bias, we're discriminating. These values can include favoring race, [age](maturity.md), [gender](gender.md), or implied [social class](classes.md). Unless we [analyze](logic.md) what people say and ignore their reputation, we're *always* [unfairly](morality-justice.md) biased.

We discriminate *all the time* for many reasons:

- What we [imagine](imagination.md) others may think
- [Past pain](hardship-ptsd.md) that may not have present implications
- What we perceive others may be able to [do](mind-creativity-results.md), often defined by their [aptitude](humanity.md), [status](groups-member.md) in specific [groups](groups-small.md), or our [understanding](understanding.md) of their [maturity](maturity.md)
- [Physical attractiveness](gender.md), distinguishing features like clothing, and [hygiene](people-2_image.md)
- Even when we've tried to remove bias, we often discriminate on [ideas](values.md) alone as theories without any consideration for [history](trends.md)

A stereotype is [habitual](habits.md) and [unfair](morality-justice.md) discrimination. Because we're not conscious of it, we make silly overgeneralizations that lose any sense of [logic](logic.md). People can often address it with [humor](humor.md), but when people have suffered [pain](hardship-ptsd.md) from the stereotype (or [others can benefit from it](leftism.md)), they'll miss the joke.

Stereotypes are inherently amoral because we're not aware of them when we build them. However, if we persist with them after we're made aware, we risk committing [evil](morality-evil.md).

Sneaky
------

Because of how much [power](power.md) a reputation can give, people will [work hard](mind-creativity-results.md) to [distort and tweak their image](image-distortion.md). Most people do it a little (which is essentially [lying](people-lying.md)), but some people are experts at claiming honor and redirecting shame.

When people are [skillful enough with others](people-4_friends.md) or [familiar enough with someone](people-friends.md), it's *impossible* to hide reality from them. Since most of our actions are made of [habits](habits.md), and [feelings](mind-feelings.md) flavor our habits, any alteration to hide [reality](reality.md) from someone who knows what to [expect](imagination.md) will betray their ulterior [motive](purpose.md).
