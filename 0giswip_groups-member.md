A group is a combination of individuals sharing a common [purpose](/purpose/). We often see them with [structured organizations](/groups-large/), but that common purpose can extend to just about anything and be *extremely* informal and decentralized.

We connect ourselves with a group because we [believe](/certainty/) it'll serve our [purposes](/purpose/):

- We can [specialize](/specialization-cities/) in what we want to do.
- The other people in the group will keep us [safe](/safety/) from various things.
- Multiple people in the community can sufficiently meet *all* our needs.
- We can experiment with actions and [understand](/understanding/) how to behave in response.
- We'll feel [important](/meaning/) as we contribute to the group's maintenance.

In exchange, the requirements are perfectly reasonable to us:

- Obey the [rules](/rules/).
- [Trust](/trust/) everyone to do what they're [supposed](/imagination/) to.
- Contribute (at least somewhat) to the interests of others in the group.

## Finding groups

We're automatically associated with a few groups from our upbringing:

- Our [family](/family/) and family name's [reputation](/image/).
- Our family's [trades](/specialization-cities/) and [skills](/understanding/).
- Formalized education and clubs we've attended or been forced to attend.

While we all naturally identify with at least some of our [culturally](/culture/) established groups, we make [decisions](/decisions/) later that identify with *other* scopes of living:

- [Risk-averse](/safety/) people tend to identify with [accountants](https://notageni.us/accounting/), [insurance](https://notageni.us/insurance/), [cybersecurity](https://trendless.tech/cysec/), and [bureaucrats](https://notageni.us/bureaucracy/).
- Social people identify with salespeople and [marketers](https://notageni.us/marketing/).
- People who value [fun](https://adequate.life/fun/) will identify with electronic gamers.
- Physically active people identify with athletes or [sports](https://notageni.us/sports/).
- People who share a common [faith](/certainty/) identify with specific [religions](/religion/).
- People can share a common [belief](/certainty/) in a method or approach (e.g., [scientists](/science/), [self-improvement](https://adequate.life/) clubs, [philosophers](/philosophy/)).

As followers of various groups, the [leaders](/groups-large/) of that group (along with all the [sub-leaders](/groups-small/)) define the values the group follows. Very often, if that group has been around longer than the present leaders, the entire group has created its own [culture](/culture/) and [reputation](/image/).

To join a group, a member must demonstrate a sacrifice of [power](/power/) (and likely promising a future sacrifice) in exchange for a different form of power (or future power) inside the group (e.g., promising labor/expertise for the promise of money). It typically leans to more power submitted by the member (such as becoming a member of a church), and is usually meant to [represent](/image/) loyalty through that sacrifice. This sacrifice creates an in/out-group mentality that forms the group's [culture](/culture/) compared to its surrounding environment.

Typically, most group members [trust](/trust/) their [leaders](/groups-small/). Instead of [understanding](/understanding/) things for themselves, it's less work to let the leaders understand things and tell them what to [do](/results/).

Very frequently, we'll start seeing the outside of that group as a non-thing. It may or may not exist, but we'll be so engaged *inside* our group that we'll completely forget the group is linked to many, many other groups through the associations of the people in it.

As we gain [influence](/influence/) in the group and [start leading it](/groups-small/), we'll often see those changes, but not typically as junior members of the group.

## Future purpose

A group defines much of our [environment](/reality/) for us. Thus, social groups establish most of our memory, and therefore most of our [understanding](/understanding/) of the world.

By existing in a group long enough, our [purposes](/purpose/) [change](/changes/). As we grow to [trust](/trust/) the group, we associate more [future purposes](/imagination/) to it.

We continue thinking of the group as our source of [meaning](/meaning/) and [purpose](/purpose/), until it fails our [expectations](/imagination/). While *everyone* will have their own [inner conflict](/conflicts-inner/) about a leader doing something [scandalous](/taboos/), each group member is constantly wrestling with [their individual changes](/changes/) and how they'll conform those changes to match their [reputation](/image/) in that group.

The only way people continue indefinitely in a group is if the members see the group's [actions](/results/) as always [loving](/love/) or [virtuous](/morality/). Otherwise, members only stay in the group as long as they can advance self-interested [opportunities](/purpose/) or are scoping out a new group elsewhere to eventually go to.

When most of the group's members can no longer see [love](/love/) or [virtue](/morality/), the entire system devolves into a [power](/power/) game. At that point, the only way the group persists, barring a [cultural shift](/culture/) by one of the [leaders](/groups-small/), is through promising and (at least sometimes) giving [power](/power/) to the members.

## Conformity

We tend to conform our lifestyles to match the group's to the degree we [identify](/identity/) with that group and [like](/friendship/) the other members we're around:

1. We find [meaning](/meaning/) and [purpose](/purpose/) in that conformity because it reflects how we see the group's [identity](/identity/).
2. We're trying to [adapt](/changes/) to the standards we think will [influence](/influence/) the other members the most, which means we [value](/purpose/) what we think the group values and do what the group [expects](/imagination/).
3. We [anticipate](/imagination/) future purposes will also work best if we conform to those standards.

The amount the group [expects](/imagination/) us to conform is proportional to its size. [Large groups](/groups-large/) expect near-total submission, while small groups have far fewer expectations. The [conflict](/boundaries/) between the individuals and the leadership defines a *massive* portion of its [culture](/culture/).

While we conform, we tend to believe social [rules](/rules/) are the [reality](/reality/) itself around us. However, they're simply everyone's shared [imagination](/imagination/).

We tend to behave differently when we know others are observing us, often proportionally to how *much* we feel observed. However, addressing any lack of leadership integrity inside a group will usually make the leaders more shrewd than legitimately address the problem, typically proportionally to how much [power](/power/) the leaders have compared to the [dissenting](/conflicts/) member.

Frequently, to maintain our [power](/power/) in the group, we'll [state](/language/) things everyone in the group already knows (virtue signaling). That way, we can [convey](/image/) association to that group and solidify everyone else's association with it. [Leaders](/groups-small/) can also use it to keep the group together.

## Image

In [larger groups](/groups-large/), since we're not familiar with everyone, we'll become *much* more obsessed about our [image](/image/), across several possible approaches:

1. Keep a *very* polished [image](/image/) except with highly [trustworthy](/trust/), close [friends](/friendship/), which is its own [small group](/groups-small/).
2. Stay authentic with everyone and fiercely abide by [virtue](/morality/), frequently at the risk of stifled advancement or [rejection](/taboo/) by the group.
3. Keep a rigidly enforced, elaborate system of [trust](/trust/), which is what most people do inside a group.

Unfortunately, we can overwork our [image](/image/) beyond what's [healthy](/good-life/) instead of pursuing better options. We often [fear](/fear/) the [unknown](/unknown/) outside the group as if it consisted of zero available possible opportunities for our [purposes](/purpose/). Other times, we're [working](/results/) so tenaciously to maintain or build [power](/power/) that we forget what we [want](/purpose/)!

In most groups, there is an [obsessive](/addiction/) minority of that group who has decided to over-[identify](/identity/) with it, and have adapted behaviors that cause tremendous [conflicts](/boundaries/) with others. While they *aren't* the majority of the group, they [represent](/image/) that group's [values](/values/) to the [outside](/image/), proportional to the leadership's public response to them.

## Climbing

In a [group](/groups-member/), a person's influence is a [social trend](/trends/):

1. People close to that person accept/adopt the person and the things they [identify](/identity/) with, then [add them to the group](/groups-member/).
2. It moves outward from that one person as other people [trust](/trust/) the new people who trusted that person in the first place.
3. It reaches the majority, where that person is now [leading that group](/groups-small/).
4. [The group grows](/groups-large/) under that person's guidance, or that person eventually fades from importance as another person is accepted.

Generally, submission is a more reliable tactic than compliance to survive in a group. [Compliance](/rules/) (i.e., following rules) determines how rarely we will fail. Submission (i.e., subordinating power) determines the grace people in more [power](/power/) will give when we *do* fail.

In groups pertaining to aptitude or performance, a person's ability to [influence](/influence/) the leadership can "tweak" their results. Often, people will cheat the system by drawing from unique [forms of power](/power-types/), typically from the added resources of an outside group (such as their [family](/family/)). Because of this, any aptitude-based system becomes progressively worse to measure aptitude proportionally to how much leaders' [feelings](/feelings/) dictate [results](/results/).

As we gain [influence](/influence/), our group-related tasks become more complicated. Instead of our performance showing through aptitude and attention to small details, we're [measured](/image/) by our [communication](/conversation/) ability to empower *others'* aptitude and attention to small details.

The group's size and collective [influence](/influence/) represent the ceiling of how much [power](/power/) a person can [use](/purpose/). A low-ranking member, however, must spend *much* more work and more time [influencing](/influence/) until they have the [power](/power/) to make far-reaching [decisions](/decisions/).

At absolutely any point, an influencer can [violate a cultural standard](/taboos/) and incur [shame](/image/), which will *quickly* make them lose [favor](/image/) with the rest of the group. The only exception to this is in a [defective social system](/bad-systems/).

## Departure

There are a host of reasons we decide to leave a group:

- We've [changed](/changes/) too much to conform to the group's standards anymore.
- We've run out of [purposes](/purpose/) the group can satisfy.
- We've [grown up](/maturity/) and no longer are interested in what that group offers anymore.
- The group has changed, but we haven't, and we want to retain the [culture](/culture/) we used to have.

We only have a few options in that situation:

1. Leave and become a junior member of another group.
2. Leave and [start a separate group](/groups-small/).
3. Stay and slowly drift into obscurity as an outlier of the group's values. Occasionally, the outlier's behaviors, many of which were the old group's *standards*, will slowly shift to [taboos](/taboos/)!

While reforming the group *is* possible, that requires [leading that group](/groups-small/) in some capacity, and if it's not a key leadership position the group is likely to [split over the conflict](/war/). Pushing against this to try forcing a change will often involve getting ejected from the group and [labeled a pariah](/trends/).

## Application

We must stay vigilant to the influence our groups have upon us. Most people imagine their thoughts to be self-determined, but that is almost completely false, since their [decisions](/decisions/) are a reactive consequence of the group they're in.

[Unloving](/love/) groups are all power games. A cult leader focuses power upwards, and self-help seminars focus power on each individual, but it's all the same mechanism of rearranging power from its natural state.

Associating with a group that doesn't reflect any of your [values](/purpose/) is a waste of time because you're investing in something you don't stand for. If you don't [expect](/imagination/) you *will* [change](/changes/) to match the group's [culture](/culture/), you're better off finding a group somewhere else or [making your own](/groups-small/). The worst-case (and likely) possibility if you don't leave is that the group will mold you into a jaded shell of what you were.

People [change](/changes/) individually at different rates, but the group changes at the average speed of all the individuals together. So, anyone significantly above or below average will grow slower or faster than everyone else. The faster ones will often outgrow the group unless they receive positions of [influence](/influence/), but the slower ones will often become mainstays of the group and slow down its [cultural changes](/culture/).

The larger a group grows, the more extreme [personalities](/personality/) it'll acquire, and those extreme personalities become the [representation](/image/) of that group to everyone else. For that reason, by the time a group becomes [large](/groups-large/), it's already become different from it was when it was small.

Each group we [choose](/decisions/) has an opportunity cost:

- If we're not associated with a group we're unsupported but have unlimited freedom to choose a group, but associating with a group gives us [power](/power/) and frequently comes with implications to outsiders.
- We must sacrifice some [personal values](/certainty/) to join a group.
- Whatever [habits](/habits/) we had *before* we entered the group play a significant role in how much [favor](/friendship/) we can draw from the [leadership](/groups-small/).
- The [leaders](/groups-small/) *will* [expect](/imagination/) you to conform to their [values](/purpose/), whatever those values are. The higher your [influence](/influence/) in the group, the more expectations.

Join large groups to [learn](/understanding/), especially from the [elderly](/understanding/) in that group, or join as a high-rank member to [influence](/influence/). But, never join a [large group](/groups-large/) to influence anyone, since [small groups](/groups-small/) yield better [results](/results/), and they'll eventually become a large group if you're [succeeding correctly](/groups-small/).

If a group is [violating your boundaries](/boundaries/) by watching you too closely, even if it's remotely (such as via the internet), your only hope to have any privacy is to [make a public spectacle of it](/storytellers/) or leave the group. You'll usually become a leader of *another* group afterward if [nobody kills you first](/war/).

Most group membership takes [work](/purpose/), though that work may be worth it. If that group isn't yielding anything worth the work, however, it's a waste of [resources](/power/) to maintain any [status](/image/) or [affiliation](/identity/) with it.
