A church plant is the "child" of a successful church.

Carefully consider what elements to incorporate:

- Unreached demographics
- Things the current church does incorrectly
- Rituals believers should do more
- Portions of the culture to keep from the old church

Don't make a church plant unless the situation makes it necessary.

- A small church is a gathering of mostly volunteers, so it needs *much* more timing and placement than [missionaries](/leadership-missionary/).
- A church plant won't gain many new believers in a nation that freely permits the [Gospel](/gospel/) message everywhere.

Church plants only come from a few good [purposes](https://gainedin.site/purpose/):

1. A missionary has been reaping new converts enough that the region requires more support.
2. The church is changing venues or splitting, and enough members want to risk starting a new gathering.
3. A church had been [practicing heresy](/conflicts/) and the true Christians left to establish a new church.
