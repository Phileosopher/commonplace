# List of computer industry jobs

There are *many* types of tech industry roles. Most of them pay well, but have *entirely* different scopes of technical expertise. Most of them require [programming](programming-basics.md), but not all of them require [coding](programming-basics.md).

To anyone who notices, these are *not* mutually exclusive roles, and they frequently bleed into each other.
