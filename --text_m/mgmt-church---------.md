### 4 Meaning

#### balancing the motivations

There are 3 generally irreconcilable priorities that every individual (and, as a result, every church) must resolve in some prioritization:
- Intuition (i.e., trusting the Holy Spirit and/or your soul's unspoken sensations)
- Theology (i.e., philosophical beliefs pertaining to God and how to live)
- Tradition (i.e., habits bestowed by the culture of the people around you)

These are all good in their time and place, but they all present risks:
- Too much intuition creates a wishy-washy experience that's barely Christianity
- Too little intuition stifles any chance for the Holy Spirit to work
- Too much theology alienates the "least of these" (i.e., the lower-intelligence members of the Body)
- Too little theology means no clear guidance on things that God was explicitly clear on
- Too much tradition means no chance for social change, even when it's literally the most ethical thing to do
- Too little tradition means no cultural solidarity from familiar shared activities

every church Bible study ends up having the following interchangeable elements:
1. corporate prayer
   - this can also serve as news updates for everyone
2. Bible reading and interpretation
   - it may be through a book instead
3. worship songs together
these all together are effectively a "mini church", even if it's not by the official name

#### Church Models

"John MacArthur, noted author and pastor of Grace Community Church in Los Angeles, California, has remarked, 'I can tell the depth of any church spiritually after being in their worship service for only five minutes.' When asked to explain, he replied, 'If the words of the music are unusually experience-oriented, man-centered, me-focused, and so fast-paced that the service more resembles a pep rally than a worship service, that church is, more than likely, shallow and superficial.' Then MacArthur expounded, 'You must first take a church down deep in the Word if you would lead them up high in worship. The depth determines the height. The depth in the Word determines the height in worship. Shallowness in the Word leads to shallowness in worship. Too many churches try to fake it simply by turning up the volume.' This is a correct analysis, an accurate diagnosis that the contemporary church needs to hear and heed today." - Steve Lawson

There's a certain type of "model" that arises
- it's based on the [purpose] implicit in a church's politic, and represents itself in how it balances its activities

FROM AUSTIN STUCKY
With the prophesy of Daniel being fulfilled before us, especially in light of the internet age, many running to and fro, and knowledge increasing on the earth.
Will the diligent researchers and teachers among us be able to come to a solid understanding and universal agreement concerning Apostolic Teaching & Church Polity?
That will not only continue to expose the errors within the institutional frameworks handed down to us through past ages..
But compel those adventurous souls who share a common love of the truth, to detach themselves from the comfortable and familiar networks that they were raised in, to venture out into the unknown to be part of the restoration of the original ekklesia that God intended to grace the earth?

#### culture - christ vs culture

note: indicate how the guy who made the christ vs culture analysis is NOT a spiritual thinker

Jesus [confronts](https://adequate.life/conflicts/) every believer to change, which creates an [inherent conflict](https://icould.fail/devotion-chaos/) with the world's [culture](https://gainedin.site/culture/).

Christians frequently disagree on _how_ to integrate their existing [culture](https://gainedin.site/culture/) with His requirements.

Christ Against Culture - At the farthest extreme, some believers claim that Jesus is directly against all culture and rejects any cultural associations.
- The idea proposes doing away with _all_ old cultural elements.
- Famous examples include Mennonites and some Pentecostal groups.
- This stance is purist, but [irrational](https://gainedin.site/logic/) in this age since people can't _entirely_ remove their old way of life without something [new to replace it](https://icould.fail/millennium/), and the Bible's standards are broad enough to permit most Christians to keep their culture while conforming to God's standard.

Christ of Culture - At the other extreme, other believers claim that there is _no_ conflict because the Gospel brings people more into their natural culture.
- The idea proposes seeking a respectable reputation and a good life are ideal.
- Famous examples include the Gnostics and liberal Christianity (which is arguably not Christian).
- Since [persecution](https://icould.fail/persecution/) is the culture rejecting believers, and the entire New Testament is _filled_ with persecution, this view is unbiblical ([1 Peter 4](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1pe.4)).

Christ Above Culture - Some believers merge both views and say that Jesus is working through both the Church and culture.
- This idea states that God is operating through everything, even secular or evil things.
- Popular examples include the Roman Catholics and Orthodox churches.
- Irrespective of how far it goes, God _can_ and often _does_ use anything for His [purposes](https://gainedin.site/purpose/) ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/rom.8.28)).

Christ and Culture in Paradox - Some believers believe God created the world's culture before it was tainted.
- One popular example is the early American Puritans.
- Since all good things come from God, Christians in this view accept some elements of mainstream culture and reject others by whether they're deemed good.
- Taken broadly, this would mean God is restoring society [back to His original plan](https://theologos.site/millennium/).

Christ the Culture Transformer - Some believers conclude that since Jesus is redeeming all humanity, Christians should rehabilitate all cultures to God's perfect plan.
- Most Reformed groups in the Protestant Reformation have believed it.
- This belief guides Christians to convert their culture toward a perfect end.
- Taken far enough, this would then become advancing for [social justice](https://gainedin.site/leftism/), which _is_ unbiblical.

Christ the Culture Alternative - Some believers contend that they're building a brand-new culture altogether that the world will [adopt](https://gainedin.site/trends/).
- Most modern churches adhere to this idea.
- Their reasoning is that a Christian should show the perfect culture the world can either adopt or reject.
- However, this implies that there is a "[new](https://gainedin.site/image/)" culture that isn't merely a [remix](https://gainedin.site/creations/) of previous cultures.

NOTE: THIS ENTIRE IDEA WAS POSITED AS AN ANTHROPOLOGY-LEANING SECULAR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
- IN REALITY, IT'S KINDA ALL OF THEM, WITH THE GROUPS BEING PLANS OF PRIORITIZATION MORE THAN DEMARCATED GROUPS

#### mysticism vs tradition

One of the problems is that mysticism (which is HIGHLY relative) very rapidly becomes tradition as other people imitate it.

However, to be Christian, you do NOT need to have anything mystical within the experience. It's a matter of knowing a rudimentary fact, and then acting in light of that rudimentary fact.

Any mysticism is personality imposed into the experience, but it's the basis for every single Christian sect, since the Bible is a bit sparse on traditions, and nature (even human nature) abhors a vacuum.

#### the least of these

there is a class of person who is highly needy
- that person has needs that, if unmet, would mean severe [hardship] for them
- the exact needs they have, to the degree that they are legitimately needs, must be taken care of
- it is literally the most un-Christ-like behavior to deny them those basic needs
however, in that class of person, there is a significant subset of people who don't solve problems on their own
- that person has been trained to rely solely on everyone else, even when they have the means to fix a problem themselves
evidence that this may be happening:
- repeated requests for the exact same thing
- increased requests on top of existing requests for a routine thing
- no indication of a routine need being self-met
when you help a person who is perfectly capable of helping themselves, you rob them of [meaning]
- your sacrifice may be intentionally selfless, but it's not free and they're treating it like it is
- the [contractual](boundaries) nature of how human interaction works means their dependence on you incurs a form of [debt] or [slavery] on your behalf, even if it's not explicit
- you can continually forgive that "debt", and that is gracious, but your sacrifice towards them also comes with the opportunity cost of no means to sacrifice to others
- we are called to love others AS ourselves, meaning we are responsible to let people experience at least a portion of the logical consequences of their decisions
therefore, if a person tries to rely on you too much:
1. give them specifically what they need, but do not give them enough that it moves into the domain of wants
2. place healthy boundaries about how you believe they are capable individuals who can solve the problem themselves
3. communicate to everyone who may be in contact with them all of the above
- without this, loving communities will become embittered over giving, then eventually stingy
if this person utilizes shame in any way, any of the following lines will break the cycle:
- "I've noticed, as well as many others here (if applicable) that you keep needing the same things. Is there any way you can resolve these issues yourself?"
- "I know that (problem) is very significant, but I also believe you are capable to handle it. What parts of it do you want to assist with?"
- "We really want to help you, but it takes effort out of our lives to do it. How can you help us back?"
- "I really don't want to rob you of your meaning or interfere with your journey in Christ. How can we help you in a way that allows you to reap the consequences of your decisions?"
evidence that this may be happening:
- repeated requests for the exact same thing
- increased requests on top of existing requests for a routine thing
- no indication of a routine need being self-met
ironically, when church leadership steps in to communicate these things, they behave as paternalistically as the members who asked for their help on that matter
- if Person A is being overly needy on Person B, Person C is being unwise to tangle with the issue (PRoverbs 26:17)
