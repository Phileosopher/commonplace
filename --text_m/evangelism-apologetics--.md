Most apologetics studies should be a sincere attempt to intimately understand the truth more thoroughly.

Educated non-believers may point out any of [these supposed Bible contradictions](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/).

- Most of them are trying to defend a view instead of learning the truth.
- 90% of the "contradictions" have an easy explanation:
    1. A this/that explanation for something that is both/and (though it may require some thought to find it).
    2. Cultural norms of the time which are foreign to the reader.
    3. Differing eyewitness accounts, which prove the apostles didn't collude.

With that said, the Bible does have some so-called  “contradictions” that do need clearing up. While they’re relatively benign, I can see it creating a crisis of faith in a newer believer if not properly addressed. Very often, they have mundane explanations:

- Many times, Jesus will tell a parable or story, and it might have different details or placed differently in the story’s narrative. It’s only natural that he said these things dozens of times (like all teachers do). Like all human beings, they would have iterated in different forms. For the sake of simplicity, I grouped them together where they correspond to events that happened, since some of the accounts give Jesus’ stories without the context for why they arose, but they are often likely not the same event.
- When there’s a differing chronology of events, it really depends on the writer’s narrative ordering. Luke and John were designed to be chronological, while Matthew expressed his story based on themes, and Mark was somewhere in between Matthew and Luke. John also makes things complicated by covering details that nobody else did, probably because he was a kid at the time and had a more personal experience with Jesus (“the disciple whom Jesus loved”). I preserved the chronology in the general order of Luke > John > Mark > Matthew, but I don’t know if the narrative order is as necessarily important as the legitimacy of the events themselves. I did make one concession for Pilate’s trial with John, since that event would have hard-coded it onto his memory as PTSD from him being a boy at the time.
- When accounts differ while Jesus is in a crowd (which is rather frequent), there is a lot of chaos that no single account would be able to capture. This makes sense if someone is creating controversy by doing miracles while his religion’s leaders are trying to discredit him through public debate. When Jesus’ exact words differ, it makes complete sense that a gently-speaking person in a crowd, even with authority, will be misheard.
- Another thematic pattern of error involves multiple events being concatenated into one simply by their similarity. There were actually two women who broke an alabaster jar open and anointed Jesus, both with people standing by wondering about it, and both with Jesus giving a veiled rebuke. Jesus cursed a barren fig tree twice as well, both ways between Bethany and Jerusalem.
- Were there 2 demon-possessed men at the Gadarenes or 1? I’m fairly certain that if you’re in the middle of a crowd and there’s an echo in a valley, a crazy demon-possessed man will sound like 2 people and you won’t be able to see.
- Were there 2 blind men healed or 1? Mark and Luke didn’t see it, but only heard it, while Matthew did see it.
- Was Jesus’ robe purple or red? That depends if you have tritanopia color-blindness.
- Were there 2 angels or 1 at the empty tomb? There were 2, but only John heard about the second one. Plus, as an added bonus, there was a misunderstanding from how the believers the angels’ message, and they first thought it was a corpse theft before they were corrected.
- There are others, but most of the debate at this point comes from which way your bias leans while walking into reading it. If you’re trying to find a way that it didn’t happen, you’ll find one.

For many of the above, most of the fallibility of these eyewitness accounts do prove (at least to me) that later collusion by these relatively uneducated Roman peasant citizens is very unlikely. It’s more likely that these events happened as the people recorded them.

It’s also much more impressive that this ancient set of documents was so reliably and accurately reproduced across the entire known world. With the exception of the Greek majority and minority text differences (which are all relatively minor differences), these accounts are more reliable than what actually happened a few short centuries later to unseat the entirety of the Roman Empire.

Pantheists often say everything we know is only an illusion.

- Since every copy needs an original, what is that illusion of?

[The terms were acceptable to god - remember, he is supposed to be omniscient and know the future - so he gave victory to Jephthah, and the first whatsoever that greeted him upon his glorious return was his daughter, as god surely knew would happen, if god is god.

ive also found some on "https://www.patheos.com/blogs/crossexamined/2018/10/top-20-most-damning-bible-contradictions/"

I will also need explanation on these things(basically an ELI5/Explain Like I'm 5):

- The trinity(like how the son isnt the father but both are god and so on so forth)
- Is the old testament still valid if its in the Bible?
- When was the new testament compiled?
- What's the right sect?

Frequent Q&A:

Why would God allow the world/me to suffer?

- We are reaping the consequences of our sin condition that came from the Fall (Genesis 3).
- God has permitted suffering to bring godliness, though we don't know why in this life ([1 Timothy 3:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1ti.3.16)).

If God is all-loving but also knows what we'll do, why do people go to hell?

- An all-loving God gives a choice and freedom to choose against the right decision.

If you need to accept Jesus, what happens to babies that die?

- Jesus said the kingdom of heaven goes to children ([Matthew 19:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.19.14)).
- On the principle that [God](https://icould.fail/god/) is [just and fair](https://gainedin.site/justice/), He won't judge them the same way as us.

The Bible promotes slavery/incest/rape/polygamy/etc, why would God permit that?

- Our sin condition had taken root by the time He gave the Law.
- The Law made a better life for slaves/women/rape victims/etc. by giving them previously unseen [rights and liberties](https://gainedin.site/boundaries/).
- Jesus was one of the greatest advocates of minorities and women ([John 4](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/jhn.4)).

Most apologetics studies should be a sincere attempt to intimately understand the truth more thoroughly.

NOTE: PULL FROM THE BEGINNING OF GOSPEL SPLICE

Educated non-believers may point out any of [these supposed Bible contradictions](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/).

- Most of them are trying to defend a view instead of learning the truth.
- 90% of the "contradictions" have an easy explanation:
    1. A this/that explanation for something that is both/and (though it may require some thought to find it).
    2. Cultural norms of the time which are foreign to the reader.
    3. Differing eyewitness accounts, which prove the apostles didn't collude.

While good apologetics is contextual to the situation, some tried-and-true logical refutations are difficult to sidestep that validate Christianity over any other belief system.

-   Scripture itself is an utterly unstoppable force to validate God's truths ([Hebrews 4:12](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm)).
-   However, that requires that someone even imagines it's *possible* that the Bible itself has any authority in the first place.
-   Without that validation, you'll likely need to dive into the details around [philosophy](https://gainedin.site/philosophy/), [another religion's theology](https://gainedin.site/religion/), or [scientific studies](https://gainedin.site/science/).

Polytheism
----------

Consult [Socrates' Euthyphro](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html) for a clear refutation of polytheism. The short version:

1.  Good things are what the gods want.
2.  However, the gods themselves want opposing things (e.g., the god of war wants [war](https://gainedin.site/war/), but the god of peace wants [peace](https://gainedin.site/boundaries/)).
3.  Either there are no good things (since a god is satisfied in either case), or one of the gods isn't really as important as the other.
4.  At the end of this, there must be one god above all other gods, an "unknown God" above all others.

This set of ideas was partly the basis for why Socrates was put to death, and also the precedent for the Areopagus in [Acts 17:19-34](https://biblehub.com/acts/17.htm).

-   The approach Paul uses could be easily adapted as well.

Pantheism
---------

Pantheists often state that everything is an illusion.

-   The logical reality, then, is that an illusion is based on something, so it begs the question: what is the illusion of?

"Modern" Christian Updates
--------------------------

There are *many* religions/cults that indicate the following set of assertions:

1.  God delivered some degree of truth to Jews and, later, Christians.
2.  However, there are missing components that take away from what God was trying to say.
3.  The answer lies in [leader] who is now trying to set the record straight with [cult doctrine].

This is a highly contextual conflict based on the leader's history and ideas, but there is [incriminating evidence for each one](/conflicts#cults).

Atheism: Scientific
-------------------

The distinction for most atheists depends heavily on whether they trust the scientific *process* or the scientific *community*.

-   If they trust [the scientific *process*](https://gainedin.site/science/), then they'd eventually have to admit that anything scaling back to millions of years is certainly impossible to reproduce.
-   If they trust [the scientific *community*](https://notageni.us/science/) (which they usually do), then their framework of thinking is built on a certain type of "faith" in the manifold [specializations](https://gainedin.site/specialization-cities/) within that community.

The prevailing belief is the following:

1.  The universe came into existence through a single point in space (a "singularity") that exploded to create all the matter in space now (i.e., "the Big Bang theory").
2.  Over trillions of years, matter clumped together via gravity, which created stars and planets over time.
3.  One planet (Earth) had a perfect combination of events that created life as a small microbe (often involving a comet striking to create the specific circumstances).
4.  Over billions of years, that life evolved into increasingly advanced species, with the less fit species dying off and the more fit species surviving (i.e., "macro-evolution").
5.  Finally, mankind was a branch of primates that descended from the trees and started forming into increasingly complex social structures.

Either way, they will have to explain a few things:

1.  How can the singularity defy the laws of science?
    -   The First Law of Thermodynamics implies that all the energy of the universe was contained in a singularity, but something had to keep it in that state of containment for it to create a critical explosion.
    -   The Second Law of Thermodynamics refers to entropy decay, but the Big Bang was a pronounced *increase* in order that worked against entropy.
2.  How did everything in the universe get to where it's at?
    -   Why are planets and stars spherical when they should be more elliptical from the gravitational pull that created them?
    -   How did any of the stars' [nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis) get above plutonium in time to create elements like uranium to create the earth?
3.  Irreducible complexity: Why is everything vastly complex, but there aren't intermediate stages present?
    -   For example, there's a liver that fulfills hundreds of purposes, and a heart that pumps blood, and dozens of other critical organs, so the evolutionary .

Atheism: Philosophical
----------------------

Most atheistic philosophy has two mechanisms contained within it:

-   Moral relativism - the view that *all* [morality](https://gainedin.site/morality/) is completely relative
-   Nihilism - the view that [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) itself doesn't exist

Besides the general hopelessness and meaninglessness it generates, the trouble with that philosophy comes from a few problems:

1.  It presumes the universe as an uncaring and uninvolved existence (which contrasts what *anyone* who believes in God would otherwise believe).
2.  The value system holds a hard assertion that there is nothing to be found in all that meaninglessness except self-created human endeavors, which disregards the value of traditional frameworks strictly on utility alone.

Even whil Carl Jung was an atheist, his philosophy and psychoanalytical approach can prove useful, since it articulates the utility of God and worship even while denying its truth.
