### Kangaroos - Matt Levine

A well-known, somewhat exaggerated story about effective altruism goes like this:

1. Some people decided that altruism should be effective: Instead of giving money in ways that make you feel good, you should give money in ways that maximize the amount of good in the world. You try to evaluate charitable projects based on how many lives they will save, and then you give all your money to save the most lives (anywhere in the world) rather than to, say, get your name on your city's art museum.
2. Some people in the movement decided to extend the causal chain just a bit: Spending $1 million to buy mosquito nets in impoverished villages might save hundreds of lives, but spending $1 million on salaries for vaccine researchers in rich countries has a 20% chance of saving thousands of lives, so it is more valuable.
3. You can keep extending the causal chain: Spending $1 million on salaries for artificial intelligence alignment researchers in California has a 1% chance of preventing human extinction at the hands of robots, saving billions of lives - trillions, really, when you count all _future_ humans - so it is more valuable than anything else you could do. I made up that 1% number but, man, that number is going to be made up no matter what. Just make up some non-zero number and you will find that preventing AI extinction risk is the most valuable thing you can do with your money.
4. Eventually the normal form of "effective altruism" will be paying other effective altruists large salaries to worry about AI in fancy buildings, and will come to resemble the put-your-name-on-an-art-museum form of charity more than the mosquito-nets form of charity. Here, for instance, is the Center for Effective Altruism's [explanation of why it bought a castle near Oxford](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/76dQ6YfBuLzJDdTgz/reflections-on-wytham-abbey). 

I do not want to fully endorse this story - there is still a lot of effective-altruism-connected stuff that is about saving lives in poor countries, and for all I know they're right about AI extinction too; here is Scott Alexander "[In Continued Defense Of Effective Altruism](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-continued-defense-of-effective)" - but I do want to point out this thought pattern. It is:

- You find a thing that is bad (death) and spend money to attack it pretty directly.
- You notice that you can extend causal chains to create more capacity: Buying mosquito nets can save _some_ lives pretty directly, but preventing AI extinction can indirectly, with some probability, save trillions of lives. 
- You do the extended-causality thing because … you think it is better? Because it has more capacity, as a trade - it can suck up more money - than the mosquito nets thing? Because it is more convenient? Cleverer? More abstract?

There is no obvious place to cut off the causal chain, no obvious reason that a 90% probability of achieving 100 Good Points would be better than a 30% probability of 500, or a 5% probability of 5,000, or whatever. 

You [could have](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-23/nobody-wants-mutual-funds-now) a [similar thought process](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-17/you-can-t-sell-trees-no-one-cuts-down) with [carbon credits](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-21/you-can-sell-the-trees-you-don-t-cut):

1. Some people noticed that trees sequester carbon, and cutting down trees increases global warming.
2. They spun up a bunch of projects that involved preserving trees that would otherwise be cut down, or planting new trees, in ways that would slow global warming, and started awarding carbon credits for the trees that were saved.
3. You can extend the causal chain. If a logging company decides not to cut down a forest, that saves X trees and is worth Y carbon credits. But if you, I don't know, air a television ad telling people "trees are good, don't cut them down," how many trees does that save? How many carbon credits is that worth? If you fund a researcher to study tree diseases? Make up your own potentially tree-saving idea, and then award yourself some carbon credits.

"Award yourself some carbon credits" is too glib, and in fact there are various certifying bodies for carbon credits, but you can make your case. Here's [a story about kangaroos](https://theconversation.com/3-reasons-why-removing-grazing-animals-from-australias-arid-lands-for-carbon-credits-is-a-bad-idea-218129):

> One area we must scrutinise forensically are human-induced regeneration projects. These are the backbone of the [Australian] offset scheme, accounting for 30% of credits issued to-date. Over the coming years, they could be responsible for almost 50% of annual issuances. These projects claim to regenerate native forests across vast areas - not by replanting trees in cleared areas, as you might think, but by reducing grazing pressure from livestock and feral animals. …
>
> Almost all projects are in arid or semi-arid rangeland grazed by livestock and kangaroos and only partly cleared.

You don't _plant_ trees, and you don't _refrain from cutting down_ trees; there is only so much capacity for that. (You weren't going to cut down trees on the arid rangeland anyway, and planting more is hard.) Instead, you go to the arid rangeland and, uh, find some kangaroos and discourage them from eating trees? Does that reduce carbon emissions? I mean! No, argues the article:

> These projects are largely in the uncleared rangelands covering most of Australia's interior. These areas have little chance of promoting woody growth and storing more carbon, not because of grazing pressure, but because rainfall is too low, the soil too infertile, and the vegetation already close to its maximum. Forests will not regrow in these areas, particularly under hotter and drier climates. …
>
> In fact, where overgrazing does occur in Australia, it's likely to actually increase tree and shrub cover rather than reduce it. Known as woody thickening, this happens when grazing animals eat so many grasses and herbs that they skew the balance in favour of trees and taller shrubs. 

But the general thought process opens up a world of possibilities. Lots of things have _some propensity_ to increase the growth of trees. Go do those things and get your carbon credits.

### Bill Ackman vs. Harvard - Matt Levine

One model of a charitable endowment is that you are in the business of selling appreciated assets on behalf of your donors in order to maximize tax efficiency. Like:

1. A rich person owns some stock. She bought it for, say, $1 million, and it is worth $10 million now.
2. She could sell the stock for $10 million, pay taxes on her gains, and be left with something like $8 million. She could then donate that money to you and deduct $8 million from her income taxes for the year, saving $3 million or so.
3. _Or_ she could _give_ you the stock. Then she would not recognize any gains on the sale, and she'd get to deduct its full market value from her income taxes, saving almost $4 million. You get a bigger gift ($10 million instead of $8 million), and she gets a bigger tax deduction. Better trade!
4. Then _you_ sell the stock, for $10 million, and don't pay any taxes, because you are a non-taxable charitable endowment.

This is a very well-known feature of US tax law; [wealth managers](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/giving-account/what-you-can-donate/donating-stock-to-charity-b1123.html) will commonly [tell you](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/is-it-better-to-give-stock-or-cash-to-charity) to donate appreciated stock rather than cash, and if you go to, like, [Harvard University's web page](https://alumni.harvard.edu/giving), they will tell you how to donate stock, because it comes up a lot.

In this process, Step 4 is not strictly essential. If you are a big charitable endowment, you are not spending all of your money every year. You are investing it for the long run. Maybe you want to keep this stock; maybe you think it has room to run and will be worth more in the long run. 

But if you are a big charitable endowment, you have some _plan_. You sit down and think about how to construct your portfolio; you say "we should be 50% stocks and 5% bonds and 15% hedge funds and 20% private equity and 10% timberland" or whatever, and then you pick assets and managers within each category to get the portfolio that you think will best position you for the long run. And then if some big donor comes in and gives you $10 million in cash, you allocate it to that portfolio.

But lots of donors instead come to you with stock that has appreciated a lot (often stock in their own companies), they want to maximize their gifts and their deductions, and they know that the way to do that is by donating the stock. The stock doesn't fit with your plan. You are not making an _investment decision_ each time they donate the stock. You are, several times a year, getting a big concentrated position in some random stock that your big donors happen to own. An endowment with an investment portfolio consisting only of the stuff that its donors happened to have lying around would look crazy. You take the random stuff, you sell it, you buy index funds or timberland or whatever.

You are essentially a middleman: You have some target portfolio of assets you want to own, but your donations come largely in the form of _other_ assets that your donors happen to own, and you are in a position to efficiently turn the donated assets into the target assets. 

This can lead to occasional problems, though:

1. Your donors are often able to give all that money because they are successful investors, and they _like_ the stock they gave you. They think it has room to run. If you dump it the second they donate it, they will be offended. If you are like "no, you don't understand, we dump _all_ the random stuff that donors give us, we have our own investment thesis and don't want to just own your hand-me-downs," they will be even more offended. "Random stuff!" 
2. Your donors are often in position to give all that money because they are _good_ investors, and often they are _right_, and the stock _does_ go up much more than your timberland or whatever, and then you look dumb in hindsight.

Bloomberg's [Pierre Paulden reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-13/bill-ackman-says-harvard-squandered-gift-but-denies-resentment): 

> Bill Ackman denied that his weeks-long crusade against Harvard University and its president was driven by resentment toward his alma mater, but acknowledged a "serious" dispute with the school over a donation he made in 2017.
>
> "To be extremely clear, my advocacy on behalf of antisemitism, free speech on campus, and my concerns with DEI at Harvard have absolutely nothing to do with my unfortunate experience as a donor to the university," Ackman wrote in a post on X Tuesday night.

In 2017, Ackman wanted to give Harvard money to recruit economist Raj Chetty, but he "had no liquidity" due to a divorce. So:

> Ackman's solution was to give Harvard stock in Coupang Inc., at the time a speculative private venture-backed company.
>
> The stock he was giving was valued at $10 million, but Ackman said he agreed with Harvard that if the value went below $10 million he would make up the difference. But if the company went public and the stock was worth more than $15 million, he would have the right "to allocate the excess realized value" above that amount to any Harvard-related initiative of his choice.

From Ackman's [long tweet](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1734715135678177419) on the matter:

> In Wall Street speak, Harvard had a put to me at $10m, and I retained a call at $15m, with the right to allocate the excess value to the Harvard initiative of my choice.

In 2021, Coupang [went public](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-16/coupang-s-ipo-pop-served-a-purpose), and the shares he gave to Harvard were worth $85 million. He called Harvard with the good news, only to find out that Harvard had already dumped the stock. Paulden:

> He was informed that Harvard Management Co., which oversees the $51 billion endowment, had sold the stock back to Coupang in a private transaction in March 2020. Ackman said no one from Harvard Management or the administration contacted him at the time to ask if he wanted to buy back the stock or to apologize after the fact for missing out on $75 million of potential gains.

Apparently the sale price was $10 million, the same as the valuation when he gave it. Ackman argues that this was a bad investing decision by Harvard:

> Harvard had sold stock which it could have put to me for $10m at a massive discount to its value at that time. Coupang had made massive progress since my gift in December 2017 and the stock's value had increased enormously.  
>
> And Harvard had never told me that they had sold the shares. I was never offered the opportunity to buy the shares back for $10m or a higher price, which I would happily have done, had I known the University needed liquidity.  
>
> And the notion that Harvard needed $10m of liquidity in the context of a $50 billion endowment is on its face absurd. Any sophisticated investor should also understand that when a private venture-backed company is buying back stock, it is a bad idea to sell.
>
> Harvard sold the stock despite the fact that we had a contract which provided the University with downside protection at $10m while allowing it to retain 100% of the upside. It made no economic sense whatsoever for Harvard to have sold.

And, sure, I suppose that's right. Selling at $10 million when you have a put from Ackman at $10 million does extinguish a lot of option value; better to keep the stock, let it ride, and have some chance of getting $85 million with insurance that you won't get less than $10 million. And sure, arguably, it would have been polite (and a good financial move) for Harvard's Portfolio Manager For Bill Ackman to call him to be like "hey we are reshuffling the Bill Ackman Portfolio, do you want to buy any of it?" I just don't think that Harvard really has a Portfolio Manager For Bill Ackman, and I think that its decision process is often less "does it make economic sense to sell this concentrated stock position that someone walked in and handed to us" and more "why _wouldn't_ we sell this stuff and invest the money in something we picked?"

Still there is also Ackman's "call right," which is a little odd: Did he have the right to allocate the excess above $15 million _if Harvard kept the stock and realized that excess_, or was it just a standalone derivative contract where Harvard owed him any value of Coupang over $15 million whether or not it owned the stock? The latter seems weird, but Ackman seems to think that was the spirit of the deal; he writes:

> Unfortunately, the stock sale issue has never been resolved and nearly three years have gone by. And it should not have been hard for Harvard to resolve this problem. All Harvard has to do is honor the agreement it had made with me. That is, to grant me the right I bargained for:
>
> The right to allocate the $70m of excess proceeds to the Harvard-related initiative of my choice.  
>
> And this should not be hard. Harvard has $50,000,000,000 of assets, and Harvard's obligation to me represents only 0.14% of these funds, and the funds all stay at Harvard.
