## board management

be very VERY careful on how you frame the bylaws to make the board
- it's very easy for someone to abuse a poorly worded document
- all the [rules of being legally safe] apply just as much here

## buying a business

When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a total lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale. If owners behave with little regard for their business, their conduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company.

HOW TO EVALUATE BUSINESSES:
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
1. How certain are you that there are birds in the bush?
2. When will they emerge and how many will there be?
3. What is the risk-free interest rate (yield on long-term bonds)?
Answer these three questions, and you'll know the maximum value of the bush - and the maximum number of birds that should be offered for it.
This applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants.
Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital throughout the universe.

## changemaker coursera

People need to understand WHY they're doing something uncomfortable and unpleasant

- This requires the changemaker to share that importance of the unrelated thing(s)

Principles of human-centered design solutions

1. stay focused - wicked challenges are nasty and easy to get distracted from
    - Have a narrow frame of reference
    - Dig deep, don't go broadly
2. encourage wild ideas - Any idea, no matter how silly or wild or impossible, could be the start of something big
3. have 1 conversation at a time - it creates focus on details
4. defer judgment - no idea is bad when brainstorming
5. be visual - use images to evoke feeling
    - People take on what they FEEL
        - Thus, adoption comes from feeling the benefit to doing that thing instead
        - It's pushing against habit, so it has to be a strong feeling to work

How to make a solution

A understand

- This requires empathy
- Analyzing systems
    - Who does what and how?
    - Who decides what?
    - Who gets what?
    - Who connects to whom?
    - Why are we doing what we're doing?

B observe

C create context

D create ideas

E prototype

- Must be 3 things:
    - economically doable
    - Technically doable
    - People want it
- Exists with several main variables
    - People - desires, reactions, etc
    - Process - methods and systems
    - Place - location, site, region, etc

F test

- This requires several things to succeed
    - Authenticity to own your mistakes
    - Have a code of ethics that you abide by
    - Clarify that it's ALL experimental (i.e., in constant beta)

LEADERSHIP POINT:
never do for others what they can do for themselves
this gives them power that you're stripping from them by otherwise
this is REALLY critical when the power dynamic is uneven (leadership, nursing homes, variable strengths, etc)

## crisis management

Always, always, have a disaster protocol in place. It is a boss's duty to get to the scene as quickly as humanly possible. If you delay showing your face in public after a disaster, recriminations, anger and blame set in.

## diversity - old tPA

An influential organization will cross cultural boundaries
- The rapid information society we live in ensures large organizations become well-known very quickly
- Form a vision with its global effect in mind
- Developed parts of the world often forget the myriad opportunities and risks from the developing world

### Many cultural risks will damage an organization on every level

Avoid favoritism towards family members
- Draft a family employee policy
- Define their roles and responsibilities very clearly
- Treat them like every other member of the team
- Don't hire your children right out of college
    - Let them work elsewhere in the world for a few years for them to gain much-needed experience

One of the most significant organizational risks is to connecting revenue to financial success
- Revenue doesn't consider profitability, inventory management, and cash flow
- Revenue also doesn't factor a product's marketability or the organization's debts

#### Bringing together multiple unrelated groups always has risks

Uncertainty will easily cripple morale and inspire fear, so boldly negotiate and discuss
- Don't pay too much additional for your hires (5% is fine, but 20-30% loses their value)

Avoid merging perceived equals
- A merger sounds fortunate but overlooks the two group cultures
- Look for irreconcilable differences in who has unspoken power in the groups

Make sure all the cultures complement each other
- Combining a group from related products, technologies or numbers leads to enormous conflicts

Acquisitions are unequal power dynamics and adapting is more challenging
- Don't let the concessions and clarifications from the acquired group give them all the power
- On the other hand, don't disrespect the acquisition's talents or work environment

- when you eject ppl, others may follow if it's unethical

## exit strategy

### Someday you'll want to retire, so make an exit plan

Consider stepping aside and retiring or going part-time
- Don't wait to spend time with your family
Don't let boredom force your hand
Find [other ways to recharge yourself](fun)
Hire a replacement with the right qualifications
- Have specific goals for your successor
- Don't make the decision alone
- Evaluate their personalities as thoroughly as you would with resumes
- The entire organization will be uneasy, so take time to adjust your protégé into the role
If you're selling or leaving the company, ease everyone's fears by taking everything slowly and transparently communicating everything

Good leaders are willing to own up to their technical inability
They listen to other people and have a team of great counsel for their decision-making

## finding problems

Use a system called the Five Whys to make incremental investments and evolve a startup's processes gradually. The core idea of Five Whys is to tie investments directly to the prevention of the most problematic symptoms. The system takes its name from the investigative method of asking the question "Why?" five times to understand what has happened (the root cause).

At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem. Five Whys provides an opportunity to discover what that human problem might be.

Chronic problems are caused by bad process, not bad people, and remedy them accordingly.

Managers and employees can fall into the trap of using the Five Blames as a means for venting their frustrations and calling out colleagues for systemic failures.

We routinely asked new engineers to make a change to the production environment on their first day.

"If our production process is so fragile that you can break it on your very first day of work, shame on us for making it so easy to do so."

Everyone came through it with a visceral understanding of our values.

Ask teams to adopt these simple rules:
1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time.
2. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.

There are problems waiting to be solved, once you realize that you have all the tools and all the permission you need, then opportunities to contribute abound.

## growth engines

THE THREE ENGINES OF GROWTH:

(1) = The Sticky Engine of Growth

(2) = The Viral Engine of Growth:

Depend on person-to-person transmission as a necessary consequence of normal product use. Customers are not intentionally acting as evangelists; they are not necessarily trying to spread the word about the product. Growth happens automatically as a side effect of customers using the product. Viruses are not optional.

The viral engine is powered by a feedback loop that can be quantified. It is called the viral loop, and its speed is determined by a single mathematical term called the viral coefficient. The higher this coefficient is, the faster the product will spread. The viral coefficient measures how many new customers will use a product as a consequence of each new customer who signs up.

For a product with a viral coefficient of 0.1, one in every ten customers will recruit one of his or her friends. This is not a sustainable loop. Imagine that one hundred customers sign up. They will cause ten friends to sign up. Those ten friends will cause one additional person to sign up, but there the loop will fizzle out. By contrast, a viral loop with a coefficient that is greater than 1.0 will grow exponentially, because each person who signs up will bring, on average, more than one other person

Companies that rely on the viral engine of growth must focus on increasing the viral coefficient more than anything else, because even tiny changes in this number will cause dramatic changes in their future prospects.

Many viral products do not charge customers directly but rely on indirect sources of revenue such as advertising. This is the case because viral products cannot afford to have any friction impede the process of signing customers up and recruiting their friends. This can make testing the value hypothesis for viral products especially challenging. The true test of the value hypothesis is always a voluntary exchange of value between customers and the startup that serves them. A lot of confusion stems from the fact that this exchange can be monetary, as in the case of Tupperware, or nonmonetary, as in the case of Facebook. In the viral engine of growth, monetary exchange does not drive new growth; it is useful only as an indicator that customers value the product enough to pay for it. If Facebook or Hotmail had started charging customers in their early days, it would have been foolish, as it would have impeded their ability to grow. However, it is not true that customers do not give these companies something of value: by investing their time and attention in the product, they make the product valuable to advertisers.

Each customer pays a certain amount of money for the product over his or her "lifetime" as a customer. Once variable costs are deducted, this usually is called the customer lifetime value (LTV). This revenue can be invested in growth by buying advertising. Suppose an advertisement costs $100 and causes fifty new customers to sign up for the service. This ad has a cost per acquisition (CPA) of $2.00. In this example, if the product has an LTV that is greater than $2, the product will grow. The margin between the LTV and the CPA determines how fast the paid engine of growth will turn (this is called the marginal profit). Conversely, if the CPA remains at $2.00 but the LTV falls below $2.00, the company's growth will slow.

(3) = The Paid Engine of Growth

Startups that employ an outbound sales force are also using this engine, as are retail companies that rely on foot traffic. All these costs should be factored into the cost per acquisition.

The startup had an "unlimited" pricing plan, its most expensive, that cost only a few hundred dollars per month. The NGO literally could not make the purchase because it had no process in place for buying something so inexpensive. Additionally, the NGO needed substantial help in managing the rollout, educating its staff on the new tool, and tracking the impact of the change; those were all services the company was ill equipped to offer. Changing customer segments required them to switch to hiring a sizable outbound sales staff that spent time attending conferences, educating executives, and authoring white papers. Those much higher costs came with a corresponding reward: the company switched from making only a few dollars per customer to making tens and then hundreds of thousands of dollars per much larger customer. Their new engine of growth led to sustained success.

Advertising that is targeted to more affluent customers generally costs more than advertising that reaches the general public. What determines these prices is the average value earned in aggregate by the companies that are in competition for any given customer's attention. Wealthy consumers cost more to reach because they tend to become more profitable customers. Over time, any source of customer acquisition will tend to have its CPA bid up by this competition.

Successful startups usually focus on just one engine of growth, specializing in everything that is required to make it work.

I strongly recommend that startups focus on one engine at a time.

ENGINES OF GROWTH DETERMINE PRODUCT/MARKET FIT

Product/market fit to describe the moment when a startup finally finds a widespread set of customers that resonate with its product:

Conversely, in a terrible market, you can have the best product in the world and an absolutely killer team, and it doesn't matter - you're going to fail.3

To many entrepreneurs it implies that a pivot is a failure event - "our startup has failed to achieve product/market fit." It also implies the inverse - that once our product has achieved product/market fit, we won't have to pivot anymore. Both assumptions are wrong.

If a startup is attempting to use the viral engine of growth, it can focus its development efforts on things that might affect customer behavior - on the viral loop - and safely ignore those that do not. Such a startup does not need to specialize in marketing, advertising, or sales functions. Conversely, a company using the paid engine needs to develop those marketing and sales functions urgently.

What really matters is not the raw numbers or vanity metrics but the direction and degree of progress.

Overarchitecture failure, in which attempting to prevent all the various kinds of problems that could occur wound up delaying the company from putting out any product.

Friendster effect, suffering a high-profile technical failure just when customer adoption is going wild.

## investing in new ventures

We receive hundreds of business ideas every month, often directly via our website. We employ a gatekeeper - a corporate development assistant - whose job it is to record, log and classify all ideas as they arrive. She then passes them on to our experts. They read through and research the best of them. A tiny number are passed to our investment professionals - whole teams of them. So that our own vested interests don't blind us to new opportunities, none of the committee runs a Virgin business on a day-to-day basis. They ask some very tough questions. They will rigorously push and pull your business plan about to see if there is a profitable business underneath.

We look at spending plans, income forecasts, the marketing budget, and when the company is likely to break even. We work out our exit strategy - will it be a sale, or a flotation on a stock market? And, above all, we look at the key managers who will be running the business. This is the holy grail for us, because it's the people that make a great business idea work.

We sign up as branded venture capitalists (occasionally, as unbranded investors), take a stake in the company, and then look for a return on that investment after about two to five years.

A basic understanding of the business, gleaned by immersing yourself in every little detail for months or even weeks, is often enough to get you started. The volume of information you'll need to hack through will be high - so find some friends to help you - but the underlying business model is always fairly simple.

When you're first thinking through an idea, it's important not to get bogged down in complexity. Thinking simply and clearly is hard to do. It takes concentration and practice and self-discipline.

My plans acquire detail as I test them against questions that on the face of it are really quite simple - and more to do with emotions than figures. If we create the best health club in town, will existing gym users go to all the bother of transferring their membership to us?

Virgin's business aim has been to find a strong position in a game-changing market.

We put ourselves out there, searching for new opportunities. And we know that they are more likely to come our way if we get ahead of ourselves and prepare the ground first.

Virgin's normal rate of return in business is around 30 per cent.
