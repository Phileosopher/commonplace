# List of monopolies and oligopolies

The one major difference between a [large organization](groups-large.md) and a country is the [culturally](people-culture.md) accepted power to kill people (particularly [criminals](people-rules.md)) without severe intergroup [intervention](people-conflicts-war-why.md).

This is a list of organizations that have *tremendous* power but aren't formally defined as "countries". They sometimes aren't formally a "[monopoly](mgmt-badsystems.md)", but sometimes less than four *massive* organizations operate in a particular domain. If a country owns something by another name (e.g., China), listing it here isn't valid because that country already has the [power](power-types.md) to kill whoever they want.

The only way these organizations *ever* break up is either through government intervention to forcibly separate them or complete government disengagement, with the final blow coming through *other* organizations [creatively](mind-creativity.md) making [competitively similar-quality](economics.md) [products](results.md). The [solution](results.md) being more government involvement or less is a *major* [political discussion](politics-conservativeliberal.md).

Without anyone stopping them, they'll stomp out [trending](trends.md) threats to their power, but only when people aren't [taking risks](socialrisk.md) as a group to compete. They're superb at [changing their faces](people-image-distortion.md), so they'll likely change their names from this list. Since they frequently hide their [less-moral](morality.md) activity, it's not a hill I wish to die on, though I'm a target to them simply by compiling this list.

The lack of significant competition makes them rather poor at adding non-commoditized [value](values-quality.md), though, so this is technically a list of organizations that need replacing if someone can find [meaning](meaning.md) in taking the necessary [risk](socialrisk.md).

By and large, the only monopolies that *severely* affect society are food and energy, with information, logistics, and healthcare coming closely afterward.

It's worth noting that *many* domains beyond this are *very* close to worldwide monopoly control, where >80% of the domain is controlled by <10 organizations.

This is also not particularly new. The same [stories](stories-why.md) of today have played out in the past with Standard Oil and John D. Rockefeller, International Harvester, American Tobacco, U.S. Steel with J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, AT&T, and De Beers.

Each of these domains is a separate [trending](trends.md) empire complete with a dramatic rise, stagnation, and will someday [fall](legacy.md). They came mostly through the government permitting mergers and consolidation. The past dissolution of those organizations came with [legal precedents](legal-doctrines.md) outlined in the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, and Robinson-Patman Act, and the legal precedents can be summarized by 13 principles:

1. Mergers shouldn't significantly reduce the number of competitors in a market without many competitors to start with.
2. Mergers shouldn't eliminate the need for organizations to [compete](economics.md).
3. Mergers shouldn't increase the chances the organizations' leadership will [coordinate](people-conversation.md) with each other.
4. Mergers shouldn't eliminate someone else from [entering the market](entrepreneur-1_why.md).
5. Mergers shouldn't allow organizations to control products and services their competitors need to compete with them.
6. Vertical mergers (which increase control of the [supply chain](jobs-specialization.md)) shouldn't prohibit competition.
7. Mergers shouldn't expand a dominant organization's position.
8. Mergers shouldn't create a [trend](trends.md) of more mergers.
9. If a merger is part of a series of multiple acquisitions, the whole series can be taken as a collective case.
10. If a merger involves a multiservice organization, each service should be taken separately.
11. If a merger involves buyers competing, the ruling must *still* consider whether it'll prevent workers or other sellers from competing.
12. If an acquisition involves partial ownership, the ruling must *still* consider how it'll impact competition.
13. Mergers shouldn't create a monopoly or reduce competition.

This really doesn't affect megalithic corporations from going *across* industries, though. Amazon, for example, seems to own a minority market in *everything*.
