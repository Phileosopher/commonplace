# The formal sciences

The formal sciences fail
to answer the following obvious questions:

- Given the improbability of our existence, is it strictly random?
- How did consciousness come into existence? What benefit does it give?
- What is the survival benefit of existential questions?
- Can we ever make a computer into a form of life?
- Why does the Riemann hypothesis (the pattern for prime numbers) exist?
- What are the odds of beating a game of Solitaire?
