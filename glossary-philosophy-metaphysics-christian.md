# The Christian values on metaphysics

## How many parts is reality made of?

Since we are distinctly *not* God, but God has distinctly made the universe and everything in it, then all Christian metaphysics must necessarily be **dualism** across reality (except moral dualism, since Christians define [immorality](morality.md) as the *absence* of good).

- **Cartesianism/Substance dualism** can't exist strictly, since there are enough Bible verses to indicate that the [a person](humanity.md) is composed of the collective whole that incorporates *both* their mind and body (e.g., flesh/spirit battle expressed in [Romans 7:15](https://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm)).
- **Epiphenomenalism** isn't possible, since the very universe itself was corrupted by our severed ties between us and God (which is arguably a mental experience more than a physical one).
- **Mentalism** is, by Christian theology, necessarily true, since at least some part of our minds are part of our souls, which live on past this life while our brains will decay with the rest of our bodies.
- **Realism** is also necessarily true, at least regarding *our* perspective. However, if we argue that God's perspective is what holds the universe together, then **acosmism** is true according to God's perspective, and realism would therefore be incorrect.
  - Given that our hearts are thoroughly deceitful, and that we shouldn't lean on our understanding, **Naïve/Direct/Perceptual/Common-sense realism** (*and* its polar opposite **sensualism**) can't be true.

However, **monism** and **pluralism** could certainly exist *within* the universe as a subset of dualism.

- Monism evokes many [feelings](mind-feelings.md) to associate everything with everything else.
  - **Dynamism** is certainly possible if the connections between matter are inseparable from matter itself (e.g., quantum superstates).
  - **Idealism** is entirely possible, especially if we define the universe as something created for a relationship with God.
    - **German idealism** is possible to believe if we assume our minds develop a type of "commentary" on what we perceive.
    - **Objective idealism** is possible, but only if we assert that the perception of God defines what exists. Some theologies of hell, however, make this impossible (since it'd be God's non-perception).
    - **Subjective idealism** can't be true, since our minds and God's mind are intrinsically separate things that certainly both exist.
  - **Materialism** (and its derivatives in **dialectical materialism**, **historical materialism**, **naturalism**, and **physicalism**) isn't possible in Christian doctrine, since there is a *lot* of Scripture revolving around the concept of a "spirit" state that transcends a physical one.
    - In particular, **Christian materialism**, despite its name, requires indicating that only Jesus exists, and we are illusions, which takes away from any meaningful relationship God would have with us.
    - Physicalism's variants (**eliminative materialism**, **emergent materialism**, **French materialism**, **reductionism**, and **revisionary mateirialism**) are abiding by [science's](science.md) latest [trends](trends.md), but don't hold up if we assume that God is a spirit being of any form.
- Pluralism is also entirely possible if we believe that some things are designed to transcend [human understanding](understanding.md).
  - **Holism** and **organicism** has plenty of use. An example would be how the Church with all its members together is more value than each individual within the Church.
  - At the same time, **reductionism** (and **ontological reductionism**) is also significant in its place. After all, as a [thought experiment](philosophy-paradoxes.md), Jesus would still have died for one single human being.

### The verdict on reality's parts

True

- Dualism
  - Mentalism

Possible (and useful)

- Pluralism (if some things are designed to transcend human understanding)
  - Holism
  - Organicism
  - Reductionism
    - Ontological reductionism

Possible (somewhat)

- Acosmism (if God's perspective holds the universe together)
- Realism (likely)
- Monism (as a subset)
  - Dynamism (if matter and its connections are inseparable)
  - Idealism (if we conclude the universe was created for a relationship with God)
    - German idealism (since our perceptions are a "commentary" on what exists)
    - Objective idealism (if we assert that God defines what exists)

False

- Some forms of dualism
  - Substance dualism
  - Epiphenomenalism
  - Common-sense realism
  - Sensualism
- Monism (as a superset)
  - Subjective idealism
  - Materialism (and *all* subsets)

## Does reality exist?

There is no way that God's standard of justice is relative, so **absolutism** is undeniably true and **relativism** is undeniably false.

- Further, our beliefs about [God's omniscience](god.md) almost mandate a further belief in **necessitarianism** (since God doesn't technically perceive "possibility", even though we do).

The very real nature of [sin](morality-sins.md) and our implicit need for a Savior makes severe constraints on reality:

- **Accidentalism** isn't possible, since cause-and-effect is a very real thing.
- **Nominalism** can't be true because the truth of sin requires there to be an objective reality associated with a moral failing.
  - However, **conceptualism** is still possible, especially if we lean into idealism.
- **Illusionism** can't be true, since God creates actual, tangible things.
- **Immaterialism** can't be true either, since there are material, real consequences that we face as a consequence of material, real [decisions](people-decisions.md) we have made.

**Eternalism** is certainly *partly* true, at least with reference to God. Our beliefs about what God knows and how long He has known it will affect how far it goes.

**Philosophical presentism** also has a tremendous amount of possibility, since the past is simply [memories](understanding.md) and the future is simply [imagination](imagination.md).

### The Verdict

True

- Absolutism

Possible (and useful)

- Eternalism (with respect to God)
- Philosophical presentism

Possible (somewhat)

- Conceptualism

False

- Accidentalism
- Nominalism
- Illusionism
- Immaterialism

## What is reality made of?

**Anti-realism** is necessarily true in some part, since God knows what we don't, and we can't fully know God's plans.

- **Modal realism** is also at least somewhat true, given how much value God gives regarding keeping our minds and hearts pure.

**Atomism** is hard to *not* be true, since God has a cumulative design structure that uses many small things to make bigger things (e.g., protons/neutrons/electrons for all matter, neurons for all brains).

- The extremes, though, of **Buddhist atomism** and **Greek atomism** can't be true, since there's a clearly sustaining nature to atoms, but they were certainly created by God at some time in the past and will some time in the future cease to exist.

**Constructivism** certainly has merit, since our minds have constraints on what we can perceive.

**Determinism** is necessarily true in some way, since God has designed everything and knows what will happen.

- **Hereditarianism** is very possible, and likely true, especially when we consider that Scripture indicates aspects such as curses passing across generations ([Exodus 34:7](https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm)).
- **Finalism** is, in some ways, a vastly [meaningful](meaning.md) perspective within Christianity, since [Jesus will eventually create a right solution](jesus-returns.md) to all failings within society.
- However, subsets of determinism like **biologism**, **historical determinism**, and **historicism** can't be true, since our decisions are inalienably our responsibility and God is always capable of intervening to change the course of events.
- On a smaller scale, though, **indeterminism** is also possible, since misfortune happens evenly to both righteous and sinners ([Matthew 5:45](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm)).

**Emanationism** is a necessary Christian principle, since God literally made *everything* in the first place.

- While **occasionalism** can exist, it can't be complete because we would then have to conclude that God caused us to sin, which is *not* true ([James 1:13](https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm)).
- **Ontologism** is also entirely possible within Christian theology, and there is Scripture to back it ([Romans 1:20](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm)).

**Essentialism** is entirely possible, but only if we believe beyond a certain amount of [order](values.md).

**Hylozoism** is *potentially* possible, but it's a stretch. It would require defining souls as physical things (and not merely spiritual).

- However, **vitalism** has a high likelihood to be true, since our souls aren't a [scientifically measurable](science.md) thing.
- **Panpsychism** may have truth, depending how it's defined and what we qualify as having a "mind".

**Physicalism** and **mechanism** can't be true, since God is spirit ([John 4:24](https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm)).

**Intrinsicism** can sit alongside Christian theology, especially since we were thoughts of God before we became physical beings ([Psalm 139:13-16](https://biblehub.com/psalms/139.htm)).

- Even **Platonism** is possible if we assume that the forms of the universe are contained within God's mind, though there can't be any "goodness" inherent to the forms relative to their physical expressions.

**Optimism** is the only reliable Christian way to see this universe (e.g., [Liebniz' "best of all possible worlds"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds)), and necessitates that **pessimism** can't be true in any grand scope.

**Voluntarism** is profoundly true if we believe God literally *designed* the universe for our relationship with Him (which places our wills into a higher value than we'd otherwise imagine).

### The verdict on reality's composition

True

- Determinism
  - Hereditarianism
  - Finalism
- Emanationism

Possible (and useful)

- Atomism (since God designed everything from smaller components)
- Anti-realism (since God has hidden plans)
  - Modal realism (since God cares so much about how we see things in our minds)
- Constructivism (since our minds have constraints on what we can perceive)
- Essentialism
- Indeterminism (at a small scale)
- Intrinsicism (since we were God's "thoughts" first)
- Ontologism
- Optimism (in general)

Possible (somewhat)

- Platonism (if the "form" isn't inherently superior to the form's reflection)
- Vitalism (since our souls aren't scientifically measurable)
- Voluntarism (if our wills are the reason for the universe's existence)

Possible (but difficult)

- Hylozoism
- Panpsychism
- Pessimism (on a small scale)

False

- Atomism (at its extremes)
  - Buddhist atomism
  - Greek atomism
- Determinism (in some forms)
  - Biologism
  - Historical determinism
  - Historicism
- Occasionalism
- Physicalism
  - Mechanism

## Who runs reality?

**Animism** can be entirely true, but any spiritual authority will be subordinate to God's authority.

While anti-theism is somewhat true, **nontheism** simply can't be true if Christianity holds truth.

- **Agnosticism** (and its subsets, and the hybrid of **transtheism**) are untrue, since the God of the Bible is *certainly* knowable with distinctive qualities.
- **Atheism** (and its subsets) are untrue, since there obviously *is* a God.
- Further, hybrids and derivatives like **Agnostic atheism** and **Ignosticism** can't be true either.
- While it isn't direct, **Darwinism** is very difficult to harmonize with Christianity and requires plenty of [symbolic associations](symbols.md) to come to that conclusion.

Christianity is essentially and indisputably a subset of **theism**.

- In particular, it's vastly and non-negotiably **monotheism**.
  - **Augustinianism** is definitely true, since the dichotomy of spiritual and physical does *not* have an implicit goodness or badness (i.e., there are spiritual [demons](spiritual-warfare.md) and angels, there are physical sinners and physical Jesus Christ as sinless).
  - **Classical theism** is at least *somewhat* true, but the essence of Jesus makes it impossible to go all the way with the idea (since He wants a [friendship](people-friends.md) with us and is therefore affected by our lives and [decisions](people-decisions.md) by extension).
  - **Deism** can't be true, since God has a clearly vested interest in humanity's decisions and development.
  - Since God is *clearly* distinct from the universe, **pantheism**, **panentheism**, **pandeism**, **monistic theism** can't be true.
  - **Substance monotheism** is necessary in some form as a necessary basis of understanding the Trinity.
- Christianity also necessitates **creationism**, with the universe being a clear product of God's design.
  - **Young Earth creationism** is the only logical conclusion without incorporating [modern scientific trends](science.md).
    - It's even possible to believe the more radical **Omphalos creationism**.
  - **Theistic evolution** (and its neighbors **Old Earth creationism** and **gap creationism**) requires merging with Darwinism, and is difficult to logically validate.
- While **philosophical theism** is *possible* for a Christian, it's a very shaky ground because it implies that one can find salvation without God's divine revelation (which [simply can't happen by merely observing nature](https://theologos.site/gospel/)).
- **Polytheism** is not true, at least with respect to the universe's creation.
  - However, it *is* possible to fully believe **monolatry** as a Christian, though **henotheism** (and its subset **kathenotheism**) go too far with the idea.
- **Substantialism** is also possible, since God made everything.

### The verdict on reality's manager

True

- Theism (generally)
  - Augustinian theism
  - Substance monotheism
- Creationism

Possible (and useful)

- Creationism (in a few forms)
  - Young Earth creationism (driven by either [scientific beliefs](science.md) or [the Bible](bible.md) directly)
  - Omphalos creationism (which effectively throws out scientific beliefs)

Possible (somewhat)

- Animism (as long as it's subordinate to God's authority)
- Theism (in some forms)
  - Classical theism
- Substantialism (since God made everything)
- Polytheism (by defining "gods" outside of worthiness of worship)
  - Monolatry

Possible (but difficult)

- Darwinism
- Theistic evolution
  - Old Earth creationism
  - Gap creationism
- Philosophical theism

False

- Nontheism
  - Agnosticism
  - Atheism
  - Agnostic atheism
  - Ignosticism
- Deism
- Polytheism (almost entirely)
  - Henotheism
  - Kathenotheism
