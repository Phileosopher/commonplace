1997

- Marshall Applewhite, leader of the Heaven's Gate cult, claimed that a spacecraft was trailing the Comet Hale-Bopp and argued that suicide was "the only way to evacuate this Earth" so that the cult members' souls could board the supposed craft and be taken to another "level of existence above human".

Comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp intersected the star on the same date in two adjacent years (Hyakutake in 1996 and Hale-Bopp in 1997). Plotting the two comets' trajectories from April 1 to April 30 on the two years forms an almost perfect cross. They intersect between the eyes of the Medusa head that Perseus is holding in his left hand. "Algol" means "Demon Star" in Arabic. The head is known as Rosh Satan (the head of Satan) in Hebrew. Also, on the evening of April 10, there will be a lunar occultation of the star Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus.
- An Irish archbishop named James Ussher in 1658 estimated that the first day of creation occurred on October 23, 4004, BC. This would make the time interval between the creation of the world and a common estimate of the birth of Christ to be precisely 4000 years. He also estimated that the end of the world would occur exactly 6000 years later, on October 23, 1997.

- A Jewish group called the Temple Mount and Land of Israel Faithful Movement were expected to attempt placing the cornerstone of a new temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The Rapture Ready home page had predicted that the "Tribulation" would be triggered by that event. Previous attempts had failed, either because of riots or police action. There was one report that they were going to try to airlift the stone by helicopter this time. On October 20, several thousand police officers were deployed throughout Jerusalem; they successfully prevented access to the Temple Mount.
- The Sacerdotal Knights of National Security reported that "A space alien captured at a UFO landing site in eastern Missouri cracked under interrogation by the CIA and admitted that an extraterrestrial army will attack Earth on November 27 with the express purpose of stripping our planet of every natural resource they can find a use for -- and making slaves of every man, woman, and child in the world!"

1998

- Edgar Casey predicted that the earth would have a new pole during the winter of 1997-1998. Since the earth spins like a gyroscope, this would take an enormous amount of energy. That amount of energy would cause a massive disruption to the oceans and the earth's crust. That could, in turn, cause severe, worldwide tidal waves, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
- Hon-Ming Chen, leader of the Taiwanese cult God's Salvation Church, or Chen Tao ("The True Way") claimed that God would come to Earth in a flying saucer at 10:00 am on March 31, 1998.

On March 25, God was to appear on Channel 18 on every TV set in the US.
- Because 666 times three equals 1998 some people pointed to 1998 as being a prophetically significant year.
- On Apr 30, 1998, when Israel's new nation turned 50, The tribulation would start. The reasoning for this date had to do with God's age requirement for priesthood, which is between 30-50.
- Marilyn Agee in her book The End of the Age predicted the end of the world on May 31, 1998. This date will conclude the 6000-year cycle from the time of Adam.

Bob is J.R. Dobbs, leader and High Epopt of the Church of the SubGenius, Living Avatar of Slack, the Saint of Sales. He was responsible for founding the Church on a shifting, sandy beach of hypocrisy.

- Russian scientist Vladimir Sobolyovhas of the Rerikh Academy has analyzed prophesies made by Russian saints, Nostradamus, etc. He announced his conclusions in September 1997 that the earth's axis will suddenly tilt about 30 degrees sometime during the next two years. This will submerge the Scandinavian countries and Britain underwater, in what is termed the Armageddon Flood. Siberia will be spared. He expects that aliens will intervene and lead the world into the fourth dimension. Currently, these aliens are on earth, but in hiding. Sobolyovhas said: "If we completely believed in them, we would get lazy. So they are clever. They stay hidden in the fourth dimension and only show themselves occasionally.''

The second Jesus is supposed to live in Vancouver, BC, look like Abraham Lincoln, and have been born in late 1969. Their search was unsuccessful.
- The website CALENdeRsign® listed many astronomical events that would happen as the millennium closed. On August 11, 1999, there would be a total solar eclipse, followed by a total lunar eclipse on January 21, 2000, followed by a triple planetary conjunction in May 2000 involving Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The planetary conjunction happened in 7 BC and is thought by some to be the star that some Gospels mentioned that led the three wise men to Jesus.

He also preached that a series of disasters is about to strike, probably soon after the year 2000, during which time the unworthy and wicked will be cleansed from the Earth.

- Brad Larson's Big Rip theory predicts that the entire universe will eventually be progressively torn apart if the strength of dark energy increases with time. Small massless patches then collapse back into a single point renewing the Big Bang Cycle then causing it to explode out again renewing the universal cycle by its continual expansion. One hypothetical example of the theory places the end in approximately 22 billion years' time.

- The heat death of the universe is a suggested final fate of the universe, in which the universe has diminished to a state of no thermodynamic free energy and therefore can no longer sustain motion or life.
