# The summarized history of the Christian church 6: More Politics

From this point, the Councils took on a different tone. Instead of focusing on high-ended [theological](theology.md) doctrines, they started wrestling more often with the mundane political activities of everyday Catholics.

Roman Catholic Ecumenical Council #9 in 1123 - The First Lateran Council, feat. Pope Callistus II and Emperor Henry V w/ ~900 bishops and abbots

- Confirmed the Concordat of Worms (basically prevented the Emperor from appointing clergy, but let the Emperor be present to [influence](power-influence.md) the election of that clergy)
- Decided to recover the geographical state of Israel from Muslim control with a crusade

Roman Catholic Ecumenical Council #10 in 1139 - The Second Lateran Council, feat. Pope Innocent II and Emperor Conrad III w/ ~1000 prelates (with the effects of the recently deceased antipope Anacletus II)

- Condemned Arnoldism as heresy (that the Catholic Church should renounce property ownership)
- Reaffirmed baptism of infants
- Reaffirmed the sacramental nature of priesthood, marriage, and the Eucharist
- Declared that priests can't have valid marriages
