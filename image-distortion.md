# List of image distortion methods

NOTE: We often don't know how to get [power](power.md) and often [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) losing it. So, we do weird things to [lie](people-lying.md) about it, usually to make ourselves [look](image.md) more powerful. While this list isn't comprehensive, it gives an indicator of the types of things worth watching out for in other people and [groups](groups-large.md).

Almost everything in this list works to serve a few main themes:

1. Redirect blame or minimize it.
2. Make something look good (typically [virtuous](morality.md)) or at least better by comparison to something else.
3. Separate ideas that shouldn't be separated, frequently to distance [feelings](mind-feelings.md) from the thing.
4. Combine ideas that shouldn't be combined, typically to make people [feel](mind-feelings.md) more strongly about it.

Experts at distorting appearances are frequently good at [predicting](imagination.md) what will happen, and regularly do it prematurely before adverse consequences happen.

## [Mental](understanding.md)

Beliefs

- Solidify [belief](understanding-certainty.md) via [hypnosis](habits.md) about something that can't be confirmed in [reality](reality.md).
- [Emotionally](mind-feelings.md) distance [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md) into "boxes" to [perform](results.md) despite disbelieving something, often with the [language](language.md)/[conversation](people-conversation.md) distortion methods below.
- Respond to questions, and create a basis of [understanding](understanding.md), with an oversimplified answer that [feels](mind-feelings.md) like it's more true out of its simplicity.

[Logic](logic.md)

- Invalidate premises to reposition or open up the possibilities for reasoning.
- Add new premises that change the [story](stories.md), typically intensifying it.
- Provide unusual or irrational conclusions that [imply](mind-feelings.md) new premises that don't exist.
- Justify the moral basis of something by [trusting](understanding-certainty.md) that a [decision](people-decisions.md) is inherently [good](morality.md) from what it [might](trust.md) [cause](results.md).
- Make someone doubt and question [understanding](understanding.md), [perceptions](image.md), and [reasoning](logic.md) they [know](understanding-certainty.md) to be [true](reality.md) ("gaslighting").
- Justify the basis of something by virtue of someone's [authority](jobs-specialization.md).
- Express a secondary motive as the primary [purpose](purpose.md).

## [Language](language.md)

Word Choice - Replacement

- [Specialized](jobs-specialization.md) and trade-specific jargon that sounds more [educated](understanding.md), signals [group membership](groups-member.md), or hides how things [feel](mind-feelings.md).
- A word that [feels](mind-feelings.md) stronger indicates more [power](power.md) or provokes more [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) (e.g., "weapon of war" instead of "gun").
- A word that [feels](mind-feelings.md) weaker indicates less [power](power.md) and often implies [victimhood](hardship-ptsd.md).
- Words can be swapped to build associations to other words (e.g., "attacked" versus "defended").
- Acronyms make something look more formally established (e.g., "LGBT" instead of "homosexual", most military acronyms).
- Frequently call things by what they aren't until it's [habituated](habits.md) into everyone's memory.
- Change a verb or conjunction to make something a [lie](people-lying.md) (e.g., "walked *in* the room" vs "walked *near* the room").
- Swapping out a word in a familiar saying.

Word Choice - Additions

- Include adjectives to modify the present image of something (e.g., "The People's Democratic Republic of North Korea").
- Use the word "free" to imply an obvious [decision](people-decisions.md) while hiding other costs.
- Borrow a different word that evokes a [feeling](mind-feelings.md) formerly unrelated to the value, which can *completely* rearrange the [story](stories.md).

Math

- [Lie](people-lying.md) about quantities, especially small lies that could be mistaken as simply accidental.
- Hide trailing zeros with "K" or "M" to make a number seem larger or smaller, especially by comparison to other numbers.
- Invert percentages to make the numbers [feel](mind-feelings.md) higher or lower (e.g., 3% chance of death vs. 97% chance of living).
- Use algorithms (i.e., a set of number-based conditional rules) to hide bias, typically with the claim that the algorithm is neutral.

Word Placement

- Separate two words in a sentence to create [emotional](mind-feelings.md) distance ("The **senator**, in many ways, was a just man, but he was caught having **murdered** his wife.")
- Stick two words in a sentence closer together ("The **officer's murder** case was solved today in the arrest of a local clerk.").
- Frequently place a word next to another word to entirely change its implication (e.g., "pompous" was once a positive implication, but now implies "pompous ass").

Sentence Choice

- Use the passive voice to remove the subject of the sentence from the idea ("The murder had been done by him").
- Use long sentences, extended oration, and elaborate sentences to give ideas [emotional](mind-feelings.md) distance.
