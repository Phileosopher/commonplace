# Sacraments and rituals list

This is a list of sacraments and rituals historically kept through the Church.

To make it simpler, there's a clarification legend throughout this body of text:

- R: Roman Catholic tradition
- E: Eastern Orthodox tradition
- P: Protestant tradition preserved from Catholicism
- I: independent tradition outside the Catholic canon, or idea that has been proposed or tried in some churches

## Sacraments

Churches often have [ritual](habits.md) ceremonies, also called sacraments.

- Almost anything that gives God praise is good, even if it's not specified in the Bible.
- It's only natural if the church's sacraments will reflect the good parts of the members' original [culture and traditions](people-culture.md).
- These sacraments may or may not dovetail into the rest of a weekly church service.

### Greetings

Calling each other by familial titles (e.g., brother, sister).

C/E: Deprecated in most uses, but leaders are still referred to as "Father".

P: Typically not used in most denominations except [Pentecostal](history-church.md), except with smaller groups of believers among each other.

### Baptism

A [symbol](symbols.md) of our spiritual baptism in Christ, and commanded by Scripture ([1 Peter 3:21](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm)).

- Water baptism doesn't give salvation, but does show it to the world ([Luke 23:29-43](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/23.htm)).
  - Most churches that baptize will stress the significance of baptism.
- The water can be by immersion or sprinkling.
  - Immersion symbolizes the complete end of one's [identity](identity.md) as part of this world.
  - However, sprinkling can imply that we're imperfect and will still sin (and therefore need [God's continued work](jesus-gospel.md)).

C/E: Baptism is at birth (often with circumcision), or possibly during Confirmation.

- Along with baptism, many Christians borrow from Hebrew tradition and circumcise infants as well.

P: Baptism is only after conversion.

### Confirmation

A public declaration of faith in Christ.

C/E: Confirmation is the completion of the water baptism.

While there's no ritual for Protestants, they honor someone's private prayer to receive Christ ("the Sinner's Prayer"):

- e.g., "Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am very sorry and now want to turn away from my past life toward you. Please forgive me and help me to avoid sinning again. I believe your son Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name, I pray, Amen."

### Eucharist/communion

The elements include a type of bread representing Christ's bodily sacrifice and grape juice or wine to represent covering our sins with His blood.

- Irrespective of its meaning, communion is Jesus' command ([John 6:53-58](https://biblehub.com/bsb/john/6.htm)).

Elements

- C/E: official sacramental bread, made without yeast
  - P: saltine crackers or any bread made without yeast

  - C/E: a highly ordered set of multiple prayers and sayings that converts the bread and wine into Jesus' physical body and blood (transubstantiation).
    - The timing of *when* this happens differs between Catholic and Eastern Orthodox.
  - P: a prayer and meditative song.
- C: The Lord's Prayer
  - Reciting the Lord's Prayer ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://www.biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm)).
- C: Sign/Rite of Peace
  - The leader prays for Jesus' peace to fill everywhere.
- Fraction Rite/Lamb of God
  - C: the bread is broken by the leader
  - P: the bread is broken by the people, or passed around pre-broken on a plate
  - I: the people go to the bread and break it off themselves
- Communion
  - C: an acknowledgment that nobody is worthy to receive the gift, then the leader takes it, followed by the people
  - P: a recitation of the Bible verse saying to consume the elements ([Matthew 26:26-28](https://www.biblehub.com/matthew/26.htm))
- C: Prayer after Communion
  - A request that the benefits of the communion will remain active in daily life later.

### Penance/confession

Asking for forgiveness of [sins](morality-sins.md) under Christ's atonement ([James 5:16](https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm)).

C: Confession is performed by a congregant with a church leader.

P: Most don't perform *any* type of confession, but usually imply it can be a prayer conversation with God.

### Marriage

Ceremonies are frequently performed in churches.

- Marriage ceremonies show a man and woman's union symbolizing how Christ will someday unite with the Church ([Ephesians 5:25-27](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/5.htm), [Revelation 19:6-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/revelation/19.htm)).

While all Christians agree with the marriage ceremony, the details vary tremendously.

### Ordination

Appointing new church leaders.

- C: a set of ceremonies and public declaration to commemorate the event.
- P: announcements of the elected vote results.

### Anointing of the Sick

Honors people dying and passing on to the next life.

- Most Western cultures make the loss of life from this earth a grim and dark affair.
- Many Eastern cultures view death as a mixture of sorrow from missing someone and tremendous joy of their spiritual victory and chance to finally see God.

Usually represents as a funeral service, often with a wake service before it.

### Laying on of hands

Giving blessing, healing, or authority with physical contact.

- C: Deprecated for most uses except for confirmation.
- P: [Pentecostals](history-church.md) in particular emphasize its importance.

### The Peace

A 2-3 hour period of time before the Eucharist/communion for believers to [seek reconciliation](people-5_conflicts.md).

Inspired by Jesus' command to leave your gift at the altar and find closure first ([Matthew 5:23-24](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/5.htm)).

P: Only practiced occasionally, if at all.

### Love feasts

Spending time in close fellowship with other believers over a meal.

### Crowd participation

- Whatever you do, do it peacefully.
- Don't condemn prophecies or tongues, but make sure it's one at a time and builds up the Body.

However, *some* practices are [taboo](morality-taboo.md) according to the Bible.

- When women have questions, they should be silent in the public congregation and ask their husbands at home ([1 Corinthians 14:34-35](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/14.htm)).
  - This doesn't forbid female *teachers*, but individual questions can be very distracting.
- [Sinful](morality-sins.md) behavior should *never* be celebrated or honored ([1 Corinthians 5](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/5.htm)).
