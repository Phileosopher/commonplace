# Incentive triggers list

Connect things with anything that could speed up your workflow:

- Group tasks by location, what tool you'll need, or who needs it.
- As you do routine things, think 1--2 steps *ahead* of where you're at, then optimize each task to naturally flow from one to the next.
- Try to minimize "travel time", which can include going from one place to another, arm or hand movements, and moving in between rooms.

Even if you have necessary distractions, you can still usually find [creative](mind-creativity.md) ways to work *around* those things.

Set your phone or watch alarm for times you must remember.

Set things you need to take near your keys, in your shoes, or on top of your phone.

When you leave anywhere, do a once-over to ensure you won't have to return there.

When you have to search for something, put it back where you first looked for it instead of where you found it.

Whenever possible, never touch anything more than you have to.

## The night before

Journal everything you've done that day:

- Writing journals forces you to soberly consider your actions and their consequences.
- Forgive yourself by capturing the lesson and releasing the feeling.

Limit your alcohol intake to avoid interfering with your sleep cycles.

Set an alarm an hour before bedtime to start a wind-down routine:

- Set out your pajamas.
- Set out all your clothes for the next day.
- Read a paper novel.
- Drink a glass of herbal tea or cold water.
- Take a bath or shower.
- Floss and brush your teeth.

Write down your next day's tasks:

- Tomorrow, I'm going to (tomorrow's 3 most important goals)
- To be ready, I need to ___
- I will remember my ___
- Random thoughts that just came to mind are ___
- I also must remember to ___

Place your alarm clock across the room so you must wake up to turn it off:

- Never hit the snooze button.
- Never wake up to your favorite song.
- If you keep sleeping through the alarm, set a calmer one 15 minutes earlier.

If you share showers with someone, try to stagger your alarm to avoid interfering with their schedule.

Sleep 7--9 hours every night.

## Start your morning correctly

Wake up early at the same time every morning:

- Get out of bed immediately.
- Play a video game on your phone if you're groggy.
- Consider a full-spectrum LED light to wake up more quickly.
- Show up a little early to avoid feeling rushed.

Make a wake-up trigger:

- Exercise or stretch.
- Splash cold water on your face or take a cold shower.
- Drink a glass of cold water with mint or mint leaves.

Make a personal routine that gets you off to work:

1. Craft a playlist that grows more energetic or inspirational and ends when you start your day.
2. [Meditate](awareness-meditation.md), self-reflect, or pray.
3. Make your bed.
4. Take a shower, shave, and brush your teeth.
5. Prepare a protein-rich breakfast.
6. Listen to binaural beats on your headphones (chords of sounds that play different tones on the left and right ear).

Avoid anything that might discourage you:

- Sleeping or lying in bed while wishing you could sleep longer
- Reading or listening to the news
- Not showering
- A gigantic breakfast
- Coffee or other stimulants when you don't need it
- Keep all your items near you when you leave to avoid forgetting anything

## Begin your workday routine

Use a specific song or consistent location to start work.

Make a short list of what you plan to finish that day.

Start performing the tasks slowly, to ensure you get them right:

- Speed will come later once you have the muscle memory situated.
- Slow is smooth, smooth is steady, steady is fast.

Have a plan for when you want to do the task you hate the most:

- Work on your heaviest or hardest task first, when your mind is fresh.
- Alternately, get warmed up with some easy tasks before tackling the worst task of the day.

Permit extra time in your schedule to expect the unexpected.

If you need to, block off a few hours for deep work.

Make your most important decisions in the morning while your mind is clearest.

To keep your thoughts from scattering, don't check emails in the first few hours of your day.

If your work doesn't involve people (e.g., [creative work](mind-creativity.md)), work during hours when nobody is up (e.g., 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.).

## Renew your mind throughout the day

Improve your focus by taking a deep breath, holding for as long as you can, and slowly exhaling.

Take breaks when you feel like it.

If the work gets boring, do the work differently, or do work that's related but different.

Reassess your list several times.

Make a list of things you won't be able to finish that day.

## Wrap up your workday

Devote the end of your day to busywork that requires less energy.

Set a hard "done time" that forces you to leave at a reasonable hour.

Have a 2-5 minute wrap-up routine:

1. Write plenty of notes to simplify restarting the next day.
2. Tidy up your work space and close down everything.
3. Review what you did, what you could have done better, and what you shouldn't have been doing.
4. Plan the next day's list, with no more than 6 items on it that you can do sequentially.
5. Set out the most important thing for the next day.

Have an end-of-day wrap-up:

1. Consider how your day went well or poorly.
2. Prepare for the next day by setting things out.
3. Log, journal, or write.
4. Calm yourself before bed.

Use a longer wrap-up routine for the weekend:

1. Finish every possible project.
2. Clean and [organize more in-depth](organization.md).
3. Reflect on how your week went and what you could have done better.
4. Plan for the next week by looking a month ahead on your calendar.
5. Plan for downtime when your energy will likely dip.
6. Communicate to everyone concerned if you'll be inaccessible and what they should do.
7. If you're in the middle of a project, never allow yourself to miss more than two days in a row.

## Observe weekly patterns

Plan your best work at your energy's peaks, and mind-numbing work or relaxation in your valleys.

Observe slower portions of the day or week and use them to get ahead of schedule.

## Off-duty rituals

Have something specific to look forward to.

Use post-work routines to transition to relaxation.

You can only focus at work by relaxing away from it:

- Eat healthy and routinely exercise.
- Consume movies, books, and television that add legitimate value to you.
- Practice mind puzzles and play games that challenge you.
- Instead of social media, work through a list of books you've wanted to read.

Don't break your rituals on the weekend.

## Make travel time productive

If you have more than two times to remember, track it with a travel itinerary or an app.

If you can, make a more productive commute that incorporates mass transit or bicycling instead of driving.

Plan for non-internet work on a bus or waiting in an airport:

- Download and synchronize everything you'll need or might need in advance.
- Charge all electronics and keep extra cables.
- Take a power strip with you if you have two or more electrical devices.
- If you're traveling overseas, keep appropriate power adapters.
- Bring earbuds or noise-cancelling headphones.
- If you need the internet, have a wireless solution or use your phone's mobile hotspot.

Work travel already has many deadlines, so don't schedule appointments while traveling.

Work away from distractions like crowded places, blinking or shining light.

Start leaving at least 15 minutes before you have to.

### Drive better

Play meaningful audiobooks or trade-specific podcasts during your drive.

Keep a laundry basket and muffin tin in the back of your car to carry more.

Remember where you parked with a GPS tag, an app or with a photo.

Plan ahead to keep the car cool:

- Turn your steering wheel 180Â° after parking to avoid burning your hands when you get back in.
- If the car is too hot when you enter it, roll down a window on the opposite side and quickly open and close your door.
- Place a can warmer over the gear stick if it's too hot.

If you're lost, ask for directions at somewhere that delivers (like a pizza place that delivers) instead of a gas station.

Watch your speed:

- Speeding will save a few minutes, but getting pulled over can sometimes take hours.
- Drive the speed limit in an area with many stoplights to hit more green lights.
- Watch the crosswalk counter to see the timer until the red light.\
Travel the highway faster:

- Switching lanes frequently takes more time than committing to a lane.
- High-profile trucks can see accidents and roadwork ahead, so follow them.
- The exit number usually corresponds to the mile marker on the highway.
- The Exit ## sign above the large highway sign shows what side of the road it exits on.
- Interstate highways with odd numbers generally run north-south, and even numbers run east-west.

If you can see them, watch the lights to your left and right at a stoplight, since they'll change a few seconds before yours.

### Fly seamlessly

Unless you're meeting someone at the airport, dress casually.

Never check a bag:

- Most people overestimate how much they need for a trip.
- Checking a bag is expensive, time-consuming, and has the risk of getting lost.
- You'll never need to check a bag if you wash laundry at your destination.\
If you *must* check a bag:

- Consider mailing it to your destination beforehand.
- Never leave valuables like keys or money in it.
- Keep ID tags on both the outside and inside.
- Make the bag conspicuous from a distance.
- Have a plan for what you'll transfer to your carry-on if it's too heavy.

Opt for large carry-on luggage like a backpack, messenger bag, or rolling suitcase.

Don't bring any liquids with you, though you *should* bring empty drink containers.

Save a copy of your boarding pass to your phone.

Show up early to avoid missing your flight.

Take off everything *before* you get to airport security, and never make jokes with them.

Pay close attention to your gate number.

You'll have a cramped flight sitting down, so avoid sitting in the terminal.

Use the bathroom right before the flight, whether you need to or not.

Stay sober to avoid nausea from altitude changes.

If the fight is too distracting or constricting, [take a nap](sleep-naps.md).

## Streamline everything

Write down everything, since you will *not* [remember it](mind-memory.md).

If you ever find yourself wondering where your "good knife" or "good pen" are, then you have bad ones you must get rid of.

When buying a fixed-dimension object (e.g., extension cord, ladder, storage space), get one that's substantially more than you think you need.

Since it secures anything when there's tension on it, and it's easy to untie, learn to tie a bowline knot.

When carrying a load you doubt you'll make in one trip, make it two.

If you lose anything, it's typically hiding within arm's reach of where you last saw it, which often means you need to [organize your space](organization.md).

If you lose something, put it back where you first looked for it, *not* where you found it.

### Let computers do the tedious work

Use to-do list software to check off and group your tasks.

Hold yourself accountable with time-tracking software.

Synchronize your information across your devices with web apps or [cloud storage](computers-distsys-cloud.md).

Take photos of all relevant information (e.g., schedules, numbers, trade-specific details).

Download any software you think could help you:

- There are thousands of web browser plugins and extensions that can improve productivity.
- While you can get open-source software for everything, paying for higher-end software *can* save time.

Learn computer shortcuts for common software:

- [Operating systems](os-shortcuts.md)
- [Web browsing](browser-shortcuts.md)
- [Microsoft Office](office-shortcuts.md)
- Adobe software

- Automate information transfer with services like [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/) or [Zapier](http://zapier.com/).
- Get a gaming keyboard, gaming mouse or a separate gaming keypad to make macros easier to build.

Buy a second or third computer monitor to cut down on switching between tasks.

Optimize your technology:

- Prop up your phone to save your wrists, or find software on your main computer to manage notifications.
- You can fix 95% of [computer issues](fix-computers.md) by either cycling Airplane Mode or restarting it.
- Let your computer update overnight to prevent interrupting your workday.
- If your phone's storage is almost full, you can usually get rid of many, many junk files.
- Diving into computer settings gives exponential ways to improve productivity.
- As long as you've backed everything up, you can experiment as much as you want, especially if you have a second device to web-search as you go.
- If your mobile device is unresponsive, clean the screen and plug into its charger.

If you have multiple computers, try to keep them using similar systems so they can stay updated at the same interval.

- On the other hand, make sure you have a *different* computer system for the possibility that an update takes all of them offline.
