This Privacy Policy section describes:

- My policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service.
- Tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

The Service uses Your personal data to provide and improve the service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy section.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data

While using the Service, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Data that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

- Email address
- First name and last name
- Phone number
- Address, State, Province, ZIP/Postal code, City
- Usage Data

The Service may also give other opportunities for You to provide other Personal Data. By entering optional information, You consent to the Service using it:

- **Comments on any social media or blog post:** An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <https://automattic.com/privacy/>. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
  - If You leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
  - I reserve the right to use Your comments, feedback, and suggestions to improve My Service or other products and services, and am not required to give You compensation or credits for it.
- **Uploaded media:** If you upload images to the Service, You should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the Service can download and extract location data from images on the website.
- **Login information:** If a user registers on My Service, I also store the Personal Data they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their own Personal Data at any time, though they typically cannot change their username. Website administrators, including Me and possibly my Affiliates, can also see and edit that information.

#### Usage Data

Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service on any Device, and may include information such as:

- Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address)
- Your Device's browser type
- Your Device's browser version
- the pages of My Service that You visit
- the time and date of Your visit
- the time spent on those pages
- the type of Device You use
- Your Device's unique identifier (e.g., MAC address)
- Your Device's operating system
- other diagnostic data

I may also collect information Your browser or mobile device sends whenever You visit or access My Service.

Relative to most commercial services, My Service collects minimal usage data.

#### Information from Third-Party Social Media Services

I may allow You to create and log in with an Account to use the Service through the following Third-party Social Media Services:

- Google
- Facebook

If You decide to register through or otherwise grant Me access to a Third-Party Social Media Service, I may collect Personal Data already associated with Your Third-Party Social Media Service's account, such as:

- Your name
- Your email address
- Your activities on that social media service
- Your contact list associated with that account

You may also have the option of sharing additional information with Me through Your Third-Party Social Media Service's account. If You choose to provide such information and Personal Data, during registration or otherwise, You are giving Me permission to use, share, and store it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy section.
