# Examples of FAANG obstructing the Right to Repair

General

- Electronics used to come with schematics and documentation, but most modern electronics don't have any guidance for working with the [hardware components](computers-hardware.md) or bare-metal [OS](computers-os.md).
- Most modern smartphones have the OS configured to prevent completely wiping and repurposing the phone as a small computer.
- Replacement parts are sometimes impossible to get because of various proprietary features that the company will arbitrarily change for each product they distribute.
- Many times, the hardware can only be accessed directly by the vendor (e.g., Apple iPhones, CAT equipment).
- Other times, the hardware requires very specialized, expensive tools that the vendor sells (e.g., [cars](autos.md)).
