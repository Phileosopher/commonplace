# How to safely handle an injury

Contact emergency services (typically 911, 112, or 999) when you think you *might* need them, not when you do:

- Consider the [legal implications](legal-safety.md) of calling.
- If you need someone in a crowd to call, specify who should call to avoid confusion.
- Give the dispatcher your address immediately, since they can't always use GPS location.

Always keep a [well-stocked](hardship-disaster-checklist.md) and readily available first aid kit:

- You can [affordably](money-3_budget.md) make your own by filling a backpack.
- [Educate yourself](body-firstaid.md) on all likely medical procedures.

Most standard first aid kits are built for handling scrapes and bruises, so make sure you have added some extra supplies for a legitimate emergency:

- CAT tourniquets: can stop arterial bleeding in 30 seconds
- QuikClot: hemostatic gauze that makes blood clot 5 times faster than normal.
- Chest seal: covers penetrating wounds on the torso
- Israeli bandage: applies continuous pressure better than any human hand
- Rebreather: assists in performing CPR

Beyond the supplies, though, it is critical to be trained in it as well.
