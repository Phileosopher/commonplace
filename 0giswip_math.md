NOTE: DOVETAILS W/ NAG MATH

Math can best be described as the [science](/science/) of structure and order, which represents as patterns across our [perception](/image/). Unlike other sciences, though, repetition doesn't prove a mathematical concept: the only way we can tell is with [deductive certainty](/logic/) that it can't be anything else.

Math is the [science](/science/) of [order](/unknown/) itself, but represents as a distinct [language](/language/) built around clearly defined [values](/values/) that represent [symbolically](/symbols/).

Structurally, math is grounded in [logic](/logic/), with zero room for [uncertainty](/certainty/). Even uncertain things are clarified on *how* uncertain they are.

Math is grouping logical values we've [interpreted](/image/), but has no [purpose](/purpose/) inherently in itself. The form of "3" may exist in some ethereal plane (like Plato had once thought), but our human structure links objects together into [patterns](/symbols/). Therefore, "3" itself isn't useful for anything, but it can be *very* useful to say there's "3 apples" or "3 cars" or "3 letters".

Technically, math only exists in the mind. It's an advanced overlap of [logic](/logic/) that sits on top of what we see as [reality](/reality/) to help us [understand](/understanding/) it more clearly.

Most people who [highly value](/certainty/) math have a difficult time with the mind-based location of math, simply because its reliability within [nature](/reality/) makes them believe it's [immaculate](/religion/). Within most [STEM and accounting](/specialization-cities/), math *is* reality and not merely in our minds.

## Useful

Math is incredibly useful for us to find [patterns](/symbols/) in the world around us. It's the ultimate means of attaining [order](/unknown/).

Numerical values are useful to achieve and [track outward results](/results/). We always form a *non*-numeric [purpose](/purpose/) before we start using numbers:

- Someone desires to lose weight and be thin (mostly non-numeric), so they measure the 10 kg they want to lose (numeric).
- A scientist wishes to [understand](/understanding/) how black holes interact with space (non-numeric), so they measure light bending from surrounding stars (numeric).
- A CEO aims to know how well a company is doing (non-numeric), so they run reports that measure different parts of the company (numeric).

The numbers we use are simply relational to other numbers. If someone attained 4, then later attained 6, someone would consider that an improvement, but that would change if you knew they were expected to attain 793. This is a *major* tactic for [deception](/image-distortion/), especially when we [anchor](/bias/) to the first number we hear.

Living [the good life](/good-life/) requires us to *avoid* using numbers to find [purpose](/purpose/) or [meaning](/meaning/). By quantifying anything, we define our [feelings](/feelings/) by an added abstraction from reality instead of [reality](/reality/) itself.

In any meaningful situation, the ultimate goal of a numerical measurement will be a non-numerical purpose. Any measurement that is also a higher [purpose](/purpose/) on its own is either [performing another's non-numerical desires](/groups-member/) or veering into a form of [addiction](/addiction/).

## Types

There are many classes of math, and far too many to easily specify, but they all start with the primitives of [arithmetic and algebra](https://notageni.us/math/).

There are too many to specify, but the branches of math naturally expand proportional to the needs of the people calculating with them. This means that math (and its [pedagogy](/pedagogy/)) branch off into many, *many* [specializations](/specialization-cities/).

However, on a highly advanced level, math has two broad purposes of analysis:

1. Reproducing the elements of [reality](/reality/) with numbers, which is largely the domain of most math disciplines like calculus and game theory.
2. Capturing reality itself with numbers to observe any [trends](/trends/) that may emerge, which is all derived from statistics.

## Statistics uses

Most [reality](/reality/) yields [statistical results](https://notageni.us/stat/), so statistics has a vast range of applications. It can track how far someone can throw a ball, a rocket's likely trajectory, radioactive chemicals' half-life, and [social trends](/trends/). It can also often show how we change [habits](/habits/), [behave in groups](/groups-member/), and [make decisions](/decisions/).

Normally, we interpret [certainty](/certainty/) in our minds through convictions grounded in [experiences](/understanding/). Statistical systems, however, create an anomaly to that mode of reasoning:

1. Gathering statistics requires heaping up [stories](/stories/), but only for specific and measurable elements of those many, many stories, without any consideration of other things that aren't being measured.
2. All [analysis](/logic/) derived from the results can't naturally regard the qualitative experiences that were trimmed during collection.
3. Since we all need stories to [understand](/understanding/) reality, most statisticians easily interpret cause-and-effect through correlation.

Statistics are tracking reality, and reality is [uncertain](/certainty/), so all statistics are always a little uncertain. They're alarmingly accurate (when measured correctly) at determining correlation, but only in a broad sense.

Statistics, however, can *only* demonstrate correlation. Any causation only comes through how the information is [interpreted](/stories/):

- People in the 1980s who ate hot breakfasts more often than cold were dramatically more likely to have Alzheimer's Disease. We [tend](/habits/) to eat what we ate when we were kids, and cold cereal took off in [popularity](/trends/) in the 1950s.
- Crime statistics *always* go up when cities expand their police forces. Technically, crime statistics are only measuring *caught* crimes.
- The [culture](/culture/) of most of the world aligns with anthropology studies of the West, representative by data. Most anthropology data is gathered near Western universities.
- People who saw the 1984 Ghostbusters movie are more likely to die than people who saw the 2021 Ghostbusters movie. This is simply because of age-related facts.

When we hear a statistical result, we're incapable of *not* inserting our [explanation](/logic/) on the [causes or effects](/stories/) of the information. Our only hope to gain full [understanding](/understanding/) lies in forced [uncertainty](/certainty/), which requires directing our thoughts toward the specific [purpose](/purpose/) of suspending judgment, which requires tremendous effort to maintain.

Statistics don't fit our [intuition](/feelings/) for a few core reasons:

- When there are different sample sizes from different groups (e.g., populations of various districts in a country), the less-populated groups are *guaranteed* to have more high/low extremes, simply from having fewer numbers.
- Observing statistical anomalies (e.g., very unusual height) creates more engaging [stories](/stories/) and spurs the [imagination](/imagination/), and it requires training to *not* [feel](/feelings/) the outliers more than the norm.
- Possessing information on a chart doesn't explain anything directly. It indicates a connection, but that connection has to [stay unknown](/unknown/) for us to be accurate, and [we *hate* not knowing](/purpose/).
- When we experience the [possibility](/imagination/) of a [risk](/safety/), we only [feel](/feelings/) comfortable when its chances become 0%. For that reason, we tend to obsess about the smaller risks (which can theoretically be eliminated) at the opportunity cost of managing the larger ones.
- Over time, statistical things [trend](/trends/) back to normal from extremes (e.g., high-performing athletes, extremely depressed people). Without measuring what normally happens, we can imagine that a statistical change was caused *by* a measured element included in it.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a math problem where the formula has specific rules that only sometimes apply (e.g., X-5=Y if X is more than 5, but otherwise X=Y).

An algorithm is subject to the same realities as statistics: the incoming variables determine its accuracy to [reality](/reality/).

However, hiding the actual algorithmic calculation is a very effective way to [distort how things appear](/image-distortion-methods/). The people who run most [computer technologies](/technology/) over a network can often tweak information for various reasons from what it legitimately was expressing.

## Application

Since math is in our minds, it has the same fickle properties as any other [value](/values/). However, since it uses logic so intimately, we can structure it very well by comparison to any other values.

Math is *very* useful in many parts of life, but its value is based on the accuracy of the math user's mind. Further, the signal deteriorates as it's [communicated](/storytellers/), as well as whether they're [trustworthy](/certainty/) and [honest](https://adequate.life/lying/), and is augmented by how they've calibrated their [feelings](/feelings/).

Math is a [logical](/logic/) [symbol](/symbols/), so enough inputs and outputs into a mathematical proof is guaranteed to yield itself as [offensive](/taboo/), inaccurate, confusing, or inappropriate.

To solely value money is to assign a measurement of power as [power itself](/power/).

We can never expect something to go *precisely* how we envision it because we always gain 1 sample of a statistical range at any given time. All we can do is [change our statistical likelihoods](https://adequate.life/) whenever possible.

Math is useful, but it's always comparative [logic](/logic/). We must keep in mind what *any* number is comparing itself to, such as percentages or statistics.

A statistical report is a statement of curated observations and is as trustworthy as the [group](/groups-small/) it came from. There's lots of [money and power](/power/) if someone can [prove](/influence/) they're not biased (which isn't [possible](/bias/)), so the people who create statistics often [have something to lose](/power-types/) by stating that they're not precisely accurate.

Very frequently, statistics [hide lies](/image-distortion/) by making the statistician appear more credible. The value of the statistical [analysis](/logic/) comes from the [value](/creations/) of the raw data, which comes from the [quality](/quality/) of the data collection.

Claiming statistical analysis is immaculate requires faith in a [community's](/groups-member/) collective [understanding](/understanding/). Nothing is all/nothing, but statistics provide the opportunity to make a clear [story](/stories/) of reality, even if it's not precise. However, most [younger people](/maturity/) can be [influenced](/influence/) to [believe](/certainty/) statistics more than its truth.

Since math exists in the mind alone, algorithms are always biased, no matter how much data is fed into it or how well it's [constructed](/creations/), meaning algorithms are as fallible as statistics.
