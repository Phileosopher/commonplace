REDDIT COMMENT
Computer engineer here. We ship so many products that have broken features. The product is fused at the factory to disable features that just didn't bake fully before we needed to ship. Every product I ever worked on has a half dozen bugs that we could have fixed if only we had more time and money.
Eventually you have to say "it's good enough" and ship something to make money.
watched a video on semiconductor manufacturing and was shocked to learn that all the processors in the same generation are actually physically the same, it just comes down to how many defects there were at the end of manufacturing. so i5, i7, i9 intel cpus from the same generation are actually all the same prints, i9 just had more functional cores when tested after production.
edit: the video relevant section like 23 mins in, but whole thing's worth a watch
Years ago AMD released some tri core processors. Those were just quad core processors with a defect. They were priced very favorably so eventually they ran out of ‘em as they became very popular and well selling. Eventually they took perfectly functional quad cores and loaded them up with firmware that simply disabled the fourth core. By flashing them firmware for a quad core you could unlock the fourth core.
Later, one or two generations later, they would destroy the fourth core with a laser or something.

### axioms


Norman Augustine's Law Number XIII: There are many highly successful businesses in the United States. There are also many highly paid executives. The policy is not to intermingle the two.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XIV: After the year 2015, there will be no airplane crashes. There will be no takeoffs either, because electronics will occupy 100 percent of every airplane's weight.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XV: The last 10 percent of performance generates one-third of the cost and two-thirds of the problems.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XVI: In the year 2054, the entire defense budget will purchase just one aircraft. This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and Navy 3-1/2 days each per week except for leap year, when it will be made available to the Marines for the extra day.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XVII: Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XVIII: It is very expensive to achieve high unreliability. It is not uncommon to increase the cost of an item by a factor of ten for each factor of ten degradation accomplished.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XIX: Although most products will soon be too costly to purchase, there will be a thriving market in the sale of books on how to fix them.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XX: In any given year, Congress will appropriate the amount of funding approved the prior year plus three-fourths of whatever change the administration requests, minus 4-percent tax.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXI: It's easy to get a loan unless you need it.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXII: If stock market experts were so expert, they would be buying stock, not selling advice.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXIII: Any task can be completed in only one-third more time than is currently estimated.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXIV: The only thing more costly than stretching the schedule of an established project is accelerating it, which is itself the most costly action known to man.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXV: A revised schedule is to business what a new season is to an athlete or a new canvas to an artist.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXVI: If a sufficient number of management layers are superimposed on each other, it can be assured that disaster is not left to chance.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXVII: Rank does not intimidate hardware. Neither does the lack of rank.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXVIII: It is better to be the reorganizer than the reorganizee.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXIX: Executives who do not produce successful results hold on to their jobs only about five years. Those who produce effective results hang on about half a decade.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXX: By the time the people asking the questions are ready for the answers, the people doing the work have lost track of the questions.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXI: The optimum committee has no members.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXII: Hiring consultants to conduct studies can be an excellent means of turning problems into gold, your problems into their gold.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXIII: Fools rush in where incumbents fear to tread.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXIV: The process of competitively selecting contractors to perform work is based on a system of rewards and penalties, all distributed randomly.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXV: The weaker the data available upon which to base one's conclusion, the greater the precision which should be quoted in order to give the data authenticity.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXVI: The thickness of the proposal required to win a multimillion dollar contract is about one millimeter per million dollars. If all the proposals conforming to this standard were piled on top of each other at the bottom of the Grand Canyon it would probably be a good idea.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXVII: Ninety percent of the time things will turn out worse than you expect. The other 10 percent of the time you had no right to expect so much.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXVIII: The early bird gets the worm. The early worm…gets eaten.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XXXIX: Never promise to complete any project within six months of the end of the year, in either direction.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XL: Most projects start out slowly, and then sort of taper off.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLI: The more one produces, the less one gets.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLII: Simple systems are not feasible because they require infinite testing.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLIII: Hardware works best when it matters the least.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLIV: Aircraft flight in the 21st century will always be in a westerly direction, preferably supersonic, crossing time zones to provide the additional hours needed to fix the broken electronics.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLV: One should expect that the expected can be prevented, but the unexpected should have been expected.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLVI: A billion saved is a billion earned.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLVII: Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is covered with water. The other third is covered with auditors from headquarters.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLVIII: The more time you spend talking about what you have been doing, the less time you have to spend doing what you have been talking about. Eventually, you spend more and more time talking about less and less until finally you spend all your time talking about nothing.

Norman Augustine's Law Number XLIX: Regulations grow at the same rate as weeds.

Norman Augustine's Law Number L: The average regulation has a life span one-fifth as long as a chimpanzee's and one-tenth as long as a human's, but four times as long as the official's who created it.

Norman Augustine's Law Number LI: By the time of the United States Tricentennial, there will be more government workers than there are workers.

Norman Augustine's Law Number LII: People working in the private sector should try to save money. There remains the possibility that it may someday be valuable again.

The addition of Smalltalk to the requirements list yielded a candidate pool that was tiny in contrast to our previous list. These people were diamonds in the rough. They loved to program!

People say, "I haven't been given the opportunity to work on that"
Given the opportunity? Neither was I! I took the opportunity to learn.

### atomizing - agile

When software teams worked on longer-term projects, they were
inefficient and took unnecessary paths. However, when job tasks were
broken down into particular problems to be solved, which were manageable
and could be tackled within one or two weeks, developers were more
creative and effective. The practice of smallifying problems.

One of the great benefits of the agile approach is that it is also a
good method for failing fast. If you can launch ten features in the same
time it takes a competitor to launch one, you'll have ten times the
amount of experience to draw from in figuring out what has failed the
test of customer acceptance and what has succeeded.

### interviewing

When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared about was what
kind of software they wrote in their spare time. You can't do anything
really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you'll
inevitably be working on projects of your own.

### role assignment

When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people,
no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.
It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The
right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply
defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between
them that are as carefully designed.

### making decisions - risk

Part of diversification is considering the risk vs. return ratio. Any
area you decide to invest in may be high or low risk and high or low
return on investment. For instance, learning a popular technology such
as .NET is fairly low risk - many legions of programmers are doing it,
so there is plenty of support, published books, courses, job openings,
and so on. But that also means it's fairly low return on investment -
there are many legions of programmers doing it, so there's a lot of
competition for those job openings. The fact that you do it isn't so
special. Today, any number of technologies on the horizon are high risk
and potentially high reward. They may go nowhere - that's the risk.
Erlang or Haskell may be the next major language breakthrough. Or not.

One major difference between knowledge investments and financial
investments is that all knowledge investments have some value.

### conveying ideas

Any software system should be able to be guided by an appropriate
metaphor. For instance, a payroll system might be considered analogous
to a post office, with discrete mailboxes, delivery schedules, and so
on. All metaphors break down eventually, but the idea was that a
sufficiently rich metaphor could help guide the design of a system and
help answer questions that come up during development.

Why do we insert something into a container instead of add it?
Programmers are sloppy in their use of metaphors - such as "tables".

### rules

Make a rule book that no person will NOT have violated
That way, you can throw the book at the 3-10 percent of deviants who try to destroy and get away with it

### transparency - generation g

What is the internet, then? Libertarian? The internet champions and enables personal liberty.

The internet not as left, right, or libertarian bus as the connection machine that brings together any and all worldviews.

The internet doesn't make us more creative. Instead, it enables what we create to be seen, heard, and used. It enables every creator to find a public.

That takes creation out of the proprietary hands of the supposed creative class. Curmudgeons argue that they rob the creative class of its financial support and exclusivity: its pedestal.

The internet lets us find people who like what we do.

The internet kills the mass: mass economics and mass media.

Curmudgeons argue that it's flooded with crap. Only the playing field is flat. To stand out, one must rise on worth - as is defined by the public, rather than the priests - and the reward is attention.

We want to create and we want to be generous with our creations. We will get the attention we deserve. That means crap will be ignored. It just depends on your definition of crap.

### transparency

[Hacker News | The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/hacker-news/)
- it's important to note how transparency can VERY heavily affect the people there

### transparency - the new attitude

The more you control, the less you will be trusted. The more you hand over control, the more trust you will earn.

The powerful must learn to trust the public.

We still need editors, curators, teachers to find and nurture the best.

Traditionalists suggest we throw out the internet baby with the bathwater. One nasty comment, one hoax, and they try to use that to discredit the entirety of a service as a whole.

Corrections enhance credibility. Standing up and admitting your errors makes you more believable. It gives your audience faith that you will right your future wrongs.

The worst mistake is to act as if you don't make mistakes.

Blog about your plans and decisions. Join in human conversations with customers. Ask people what you should do.

Your competitive advantage is not that your designs are secret, but that you have a strong relationship with your community of customers.

Companies should be meritocracies.

Speed is a strategic necessity. Adjust to customers' actions and desires quickly. Learn from them and stay ahead of them.

Holding back products and popping them out as surprises insults your customers (unless you're Apple). The earlier they're involved with the process, the better.

Beware any strategy built on protection from cannibalization, for it probably means the cannibals are at the door and ready to eat you for lunch.

Cash flow can blind you to the strategic necessity of change, though decisions, and innovation.

Approach innovation in that order: first find the problem, then create the solution. Beware the cool idea.

Design is about more than aesthetics. Design is an ethic. Design is the path by which you interact with your public. Magazines, clothes, and cars aren't the only things that are designed. Companies are designed. Services are designed. Rules are designed.
The simpler and clearer the design, the better. To be simple is to be direct. To be direct is to be honest.

If you make a great platform, the worst thing you could do is to put yourself in the middle, getting in the way of what people want to do with it.

Make something useful. Help people use it. Then get out of the way.

### transparency - the new economy

Umar Haque's bubblegeneration.com blog has influenced Chris Anderson and me. He says media 2.0's three sources of value creation are:
- revelation (finding the good stuff)
- aggregation (distribution 2.0)
- plasticity (enabling content to be extended like mashups)

Release information bottlenecks and make things more liquid.

Stop trying to make money by interfering in transactions.

What if your goods cost you nothing?
What if you charged nothing?
Where does your value exist?
What is the essence of your business?
What can you learn from it?
How do you make money - is there a side door?

The internet is a great big race to free. Anyone who has built a business model with a price above free for something that can be free is in a tough strategic position. So how do you get to free first?

### foss workers

Corporate FOSS team composition:
Package maintaners - manage the software, get veto/approval power, often full-time thereabouts and work on the thing the corporation/university wants maintained
industry contributors - writes large sections of the code the package maintainers didn't write, relative to their preferences and involving huge swathes of code, paid for a contract or full-time
Individual contributors - bug-fixers, one-off people, pro bono paid
- NOTE: THE SAME GOES FOR CHURCH VOLUNTEERS AS FOSS CONTRIBUTORS

### types of workers

There are 3 major classes of programmer, for the sake of doing work:
1. wet behind the ears, just started working as a professional programmer and need lots of guidance
2. sort of knows what they're doing and can mostly finish tasks on their own
3. experienced, who legitimately know how things work and answer other programmers' questions (NOT necessarily based on title, and most programmers never get here EVER)
    NOTE: this is based on curiosity and interest in the subject more than years experienced

- At #2, you can either become a proper manager or stay on to become #3, and lazy people want #2
    You NEED #3 in the trenches, since some solutions can only come from experience and intuition for things
