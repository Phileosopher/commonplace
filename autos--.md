Following are the Types of Car Exhaust Smoke:
1. Black Smoke
Black smoke indicates that the engine is burning too much fuel, a condition known as running rich. This can be caused by several factors that disrupt the air-fuel mixture.
2. White Smoke
It usually means that coolant is being burned in the engine, which means that something is drastically wrong. The most common cause of this is a blown head gasket, which can quickly lead to an overheating engine.
3. Blue Smoke
Blue smoke is a clear sign that your engine is burning oil. The liquid can leak into the combustion chamber where it is burned along with fuel. You'll probably notice your car misfiring when you turn the keys in your ignition, or find your vehicle shakes more than usual when idle.
4. Grey Smoke
If the smoke from the exhaust pipe is either grey or bluish-tinged, it generally means that your engine is burning oil inside the combustion chamber. Burning oil could be due to many causes, from leaky valve seals to bad piston rings.

## Small-scale disaster: Road

Drive carefully and safely, and [keep your car running well](https://notageni.us/autos/).

Frequently check your vehicle's fluids and air pressure.

Inspect your motorcycle helmet for spiders before driving on the highway.

Keep [emergency supplies](/disaster-checklist#auto-supplies) in each of your automobiles.

Always keep a dashcam running while you're driving.

Never text and drive, or if you *must*, do it at a stoplight.

Turn off cruise control in the rain or ice to prevent spinning out of control.

REDDIT COMMENT
When a car salesman offers you a "premium car care" package, don't buy it. It's a scam.
Say you're buying a new car and I offer you the premium car care package. It'll only cost you X-amount of money per month, but every time you come to the dealership, you get:
*Premium car wash (we hose it down, not a proper car wash)
*Interior detailing and rejuvenation (we use compressed air to make the dust go away, sometimes a man uses a wet paper towel)
*Functions check and clock synchronization (Check if all the lights work, heater and A/C work and set up the clock if it's wrong)
*Summer and winter inspection and free wiper fluid refill, only done once per season. (Check tire tread, visually check tire pressure, look at temperature gauge to make sure car isn't over heating and add water in the summer, tiny amount of wiper fluid in winter, visually inspect brake disks to see they are not scratched by worn out brake pads)
*Assistance when you are on the move (You call us and then we can call a tow truck for you, at your expense, only possible during business hours)
Basically, we charge for simple things you can do yourself. Also if a car dealership sells you a used car and they told you it has been fully serviced... take it to your local mechanic and have it serviced properly.
My dad taught me to always bring a potential new car to your own mechanic for a check-up before making a purchase. If they don't want to let you do that, then you walk. I've done this 3 times now and not once has a dealership ever had an issue with it. One even let me keep the car overnight since I couldn't get an appointment until the next day.
