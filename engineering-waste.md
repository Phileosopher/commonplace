Disposing of waste is mostly a matter of [logistics](logistics.md), except for particularly dangerous materials:

- Flammable materials need to be away from sparks or other heating elements that could ignite it, as well as heat-shielding that protects it.
- Radioactive isotopes require lead shielding to prevent the nuclear radiation from affecting the surrounding area. It also can't be stored in one place, since too much in one place will create an unstoppable fission reaction.
- Sharp objects like glass must be protectively sealed to prevent anyone being harmed by it.

At scale, factories have *much* larger loads of materials to maintain, and create much more waste. It makes perfect business sense to reuse what they can (i.e., waste material becomes the input of another factory process), but it's never perfect.
