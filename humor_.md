Everyone has a sense of humor. It's a deep, subconscious [feeling](mind-feelings.md) that resonates through many [symbolic](symbols.md) associations to create a unique form of amusement.

At its core, humor is an out-of-place connection. It can come from various places:

- Exaggeration and blowing things *way* out of proportion
- A play on [words](language.md) (i.e., puns)
- Broken [logic](logic.md) where "fixing" the logic is literally impossible
- Connecting unrelated things by a purely coincidental or incidental association

Humor is *highly* contextual for the simple reason that it requires an [emotional](mind-feelings.md) connection to something [familiar](understanding.md).

Humor is similar to [horror](mind-feelings-fear.md) in that it defies [reality](reality.md). However, while horror directs us further into the [unknown](unknown.md) or toward [severe hardship](hardship-ptsd.md), humor simply defies our [expectations](imagination.md) in every conceivable direction, *including* our expectations of the unknown or severe hardship!

The mechanism to create humor requires a very specific skill of performing several tasks in sequence:

1. Mentally assemble an [imaginary model](image.md) of the experience.
2. Detect any discrepancies in all the [possible interpretations](understanding.md) of the experience. This particular step requires *severe* [awareness](awareness.md) that only comes through pushing past any [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) or [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md).
3. Remove any uninteresting perspectives from that set of experiences to only leave the discrepancies and their relationships.
4. Add [artistic flair](mind-creativity.md) to those discrepancies to distort those relationships even further.

Imitation constitutes a significant portion of humor. Exaggeration creates "parody", and imitating [power](power.md) is "satire". Since *all* power has [its season](trends.md), all satirical humor will become dated within a decade or two. However, satire strips away power because it reminds people of the [finite humanity](humanity.md) of the people wielding that power.

There are a few ways to stretch reality to make humor:

- Farce makes [improbable](math.md) things probable by delivering the concept through a distorted form of [logic](logic.md). Adults behaving precisely like [children](maturity.md), for example, is a profound source of humor.
- Hyperbole exaggerates [truth](reality.md) to the point of [emotional](mind-feelings.md) extremes, which includes body language ("pantomime").
- Metaphor and puns create [symbolic](symbols.md) connections that create extra [meanings](values.md).
- Like with magicians, re-framing and timing can exploit [expectations](imagination.md) to [fool](image-distortion.md) the audience into believing an implication.

Often, when a [trope](https://tvtropes.org/) is used frequently enough, people become savvy enough to [predict](imagination.md) it. At that point, a humorist *must* invert the trope and do something else unexpected. Naturally, as [understanding](understanding.md) scales, most funny things become less funny.

Humor always has the same components that form into a [story](stories.md):

1. A setup that builds up expectations, usually by imitating [reality](reality.md) somehow. It can be as simple as saying "a lawyer" or "a man walks into a bar". Typically, it's when a comedian walks on stage or when someone crouches a little in an "I'm going to hunt" pose.
2. A drawn-out delivery. The more drawn-out, the more people are setting [expectations](imagination.md), at least until they get bored.
3. A concluding punchline that violates the audience's expectations. It might be something spoken, a visual gag, or (in the case of an inversion) the *absence* of something expected.

Every funny idea has at least two of six dimensions:

1. Familiar - something someone has previously [experienced](understanding.md)
   - This varies wildly across people.
   - The more familiar, the less you need other dimensions.
2. Cute - someone weak and lovable
   - e.g., puppies, children, kittens, adorable animations
   - They can be visual or simply have a lovable personality.
3. Cruel - something mean or [unfair](morality-justice.md)
   1. While it must hurt, it must *also* be unfair pain.
   2. At its most extreme, cruel humor is called "dark humor".
4. Bizarre - breaking from [reality](reality.md)
   - It must be surreal, but it can't be unbelievable because people must keep believing that it could theoretically happen.
   - The simplest version of this is to imagine a world where everything is the same except for one small detail.
5. Naughty - breaking a [taboo](morality-taboo.md)
   - Naughty things are dirty, unclean, lewd, or inappropriate, and often sexual.
   - The funnier the joke, the more you can get away with.
   - Handle this dimension carefully in polite company.
6. Intuitive - [creative](mind-creativity.md) application of an idea
   - There are many ways to creatively build [humor](humor.md) outside what people expect.
   - All you have to do is surprise people with your connection.

The punchline is often either far more elaborate than the rest of the story or far simpler. Since it's the climax of the story, it's *the* most important part of any good humor.

No matter what, the punchline *needs* both pain and surprise. Someone has to suffer a pratfall, public shame, embarrassment, or future pain (such as from a mess). In the case of a practical joke or bad pun with a long delivery, the *audience* is the one in pain.

A punchline can sometimes extend beyond the joke:

- A "brick joke" uses the failed punchline of a previous joke as the punchline of a future one. It's aptly named from a not-funny joke that ends with someone throwing away a brick, then the next joke's punchline involving someone getting hit with a brick out of nowhere. Brick jokes allow [creative](mind-creativity.md) comedians to recover from a failed joke.
- A "running joke" uses a successful punchline of a previous joke to recall all the associations of the first joke into another one, often adding extra components to the joke in the process. It repeats itself as a [trend](trends.md), much like musical choruses.

Since humor draws from something familiar, it usually includes truths about reality. The attitude of the comedian *must* resonate with the audience for them to find something funny:

- Everyone does silly or dumb things, so a dimwitted person is funny.
- Many people have base thoughts (e.g., farts, sex jokes), so they find them funny.
- When someone behaves rudely or harshly to someone else, everyone either identifies with the aggressor or the victim.
- An irreverent comedian is violating [social rules](rules.md) that almost everyone, [deep down](personality.md), would love to explore themselves.

Many comedians [influence crowds](influence.md) toward their [reasoning](logic.md) by softening harsh, painful ideas with humor. The easiest method is to blow reality *way* out of proportion until it's surreal, then add silly things to it. Most of the best comedy will mix in other [feelings](mind-feelings.md) (e.g., sadness, [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md)) because it will subversively confront aspects of the [good life](goodlife.md) and [bad systems](mgmt-badsystems.md) while people are laughing.

The simplest expression of humor comes through a formalized [public speech](language-speaking.md) called "standup comedy". It's comparatively easy to perform, so all other forms of humor [trend](trends.md) from standup, with the possible exception of [written](language-writing.md) humor. There are a few broad, non-mutually-exclusive classes of standup comedy:

- A string of relatively unrelated one-line quips, often by talking very fast or speaking [offensively](morality-taboo.md) (e.g., Rodney Dangerfield).
- Offense humor, often aimed at shocking the audience or directly offending at least some of them (e.g., Sacha Baron Cohen).
- Casual humor, usually relaxed and amicable with a flourish of shock at the end (e.g., Steve Martin).
- Conversational humor, typically involving a long and generally uninteresting story, with a contrasting surprise at the end (e.g., Lucille Ball, most 1950s/1960s humor).
- Observational comedy, which addresses the absurdity of specific mundane things, and frequently safe for [families](maturity.md) (e.g., Jerry Seinfeld).
- Exaggerating typical nuisances of life, frequently with the manic intensity of a string of stories (e.g., Gabriel Iglesias, Jeff Foxworthy).
- Anger rant, with the punch line directed at the comedian by stating petty observations about tiny, frustrating things mixed with extreme, cold truths that are often [political](groups-large.md) (e.g., George Carlin, Denis Leary).

Humor isn't merely jokes and comedians. We find humor frequently throughout life in [communicating](people-conversation.md) and [action](results.md), but usually when reflecting on [patterns](trends.md) from the past. [Writing](language.md) allows for a slow buildup of various ideas together to form a highly complex funny idea.

Generally, the more painful *and* unique an experience is, the more humor we'll draw from it later once we get over the [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) from it. We won't find humor in the present-tense if we're [afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md) of anything.

One aspect hiding behind humor is that it's a reliable [stress relief](mind-feelings-happiness-focus.md) from the awful things that can happen to us. It's why [successful](success-1_why.md) people tend to also have a sense of humor.

## Application

By understanding humor, we can understand the social commentary that hides behind it, which is a key part of gaining [wisdom](understanding.md). Taking comedians seriously is living in a profoundly simple and audacious [image](image.md) of [reality](reality.md).

There's a humorous side to absolutely every situation, even when it takes [creativity](mind-creativity.md) to find it. However, the seriousness of a [culture's](culture.md) [traditions](habits.md) (e.g., [religion](religion.md)) is often [harshly opposed](morality-taboo.md) to levity.

Humor is necessary for [the good life](goodlife.md) because it helps us cope with [stress](mind-feelings-happiness.md), specifically with surprising and painful things. While serious-minded people may appear to be [successful or competent](success-1_why.md), they are frequently mentally unwell.

One of the easiest ways to [influence](influence.md) others is through adding at least a bit of humor to pretty much everything. It's difficult to hate someone you find funny.

To dismantle a [centralized power structure](groups-large.md), learn to be funny. Many [wars](people-conflicts-war.md) have been fought over, in part, giving people [the right to laugh](people-boundaries.md) at their leadership.

If [death](legacy.md) wasn't a thing, *everything* about humanity would be absolutely hilarious. This is, in some ways, the basis of [religious joyfulness](religion.md).

Any effort by leadership to impose [rules](rules.md) against humor is guaranteed to backfire.
