Underneath the new image, the mechanisms behind most things are mostly the same. There's more in common between one automobile to another, or one person to another, or one book to another than different. However, we presume those similarities and focus so heavily on the differences that most [large-scale conflicts](people-conflicts-war.md) revolve around that differentiating 0.00005%.

*Nothing* is entirely new. If you disassemble everything, every [idea](values.md) and [creation](creations.md) has existed before. Typically, people who wrote historical records forgot to [communicate](language.md) a [trend](trends.md), which then started again from a different basis. The only thing different is the combinations of specific values, and even then the [abstraction](values.md) is the same while the implementation is different.

Because a creator's [quality](values-quality.md) often comes through constraints that later creations don't have (e.g., [technological limitations](technology.md), it's already been proven to work), original works are often inherently better.
