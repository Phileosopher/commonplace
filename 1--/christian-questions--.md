Answer the littlest questions that exist
- sorta like what's on GotQuestions.org

Why does God make people poor?
1. to give those who have enough an opportunity to show Jesus (from Spurgeon)
2. to give those who don't have enough an opportunity to trust Jesus
3. to show the world through the Church what God wants to see in all humanity

Why do bad things happen to good people?

Why do we all have to die?

Why does [insert Christian culture] behave so mean?


Why would God allow the world/me to suffer?

- We are reaping the consequences of our sin condition that came from the Fall (Genesis 3).
- God has permitted suffering to bring godliness, though we don't know why in this life ([1 Timothy 3:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1ti.3.16)).

If God is all-loving but also knows what we'll do, why do people go to hell?

- An all-loving God gives a choice and freedom to choose against the right decision.

If you need to accept Jesus, what happens to babies that die?

- Jesus said the kingdom of heaven goes to children ([Matthew 19:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.19.14)).
- On the principle that [God](https://icould.fail/god/) is [just and fair](https://gainedin.site/justice/), He won't judge them the same way as us.

The Bible promotes slavery/incest/rape/polygamy/etc, why would God permit that?

- Our sin condition had taken root by the time He gave the Law.
- The Law made a better life for slaves/women/rape victims/etc. by giving them previously unseen [rights and liberties](https://gainedin.site/boundaries/).
- Jesus was one of the greatest advocates of minorities and women ([John 4](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/jhn.4)).
