# How to plan for weddings

A few hundred years ago, nearly *all* non-royalty marriages were done in someone's backyard with close family present.

At its simplest, getting married is still relatively cheap:

1. Get rings online for ~$30-40 each (more about that below).
2. Pay ~$100 to the courthouse and use their court-designated officiator.
3. Pay whatever administration fees to get marriage licenses printed and name changes.

- If you *do* want a large wedding, they only last one day, but wedding [debt](money-2_debt.md) can last for years.

## Proposing

Propose a few months to a year beforehand:

- Even if the venue is a surprise, you should both know the proposal is coming before you do it.
  - If she says "no", *seriously* reconsider the entire [relationship](relationships-why.md).
- Men traditionally propose to women, but every marriage proposal should come from the person who tends to have more authority over decisions.
- Make sure, if you're buying the rings, you know *exactly* what your fiancée/fiancé wants.
  - Since this will be the first of many financial decisions together, [discuss the costs](money-3_budget.md) with them.
- If you'd prefer to, record the wedding proposal without them knowing.

Wedding rings are usually over-priced:

- The "1-6 months of your income" rule was a De Beers jewelry marketing campaign from a few hundred years ago.
- In fact, wedding rings weren't even a marriage tradition 300 years ago.
- Learn the 4 C's:
  - Cut - shape
  - Carat - size
  - Clarity - purity
  - Color
- Since they mark up prices simply from their [brand](marketing.md), avoid mainstream diamond retailers.
- Stylish rings sell for less than $100 because diamonds have no intrinsic market value.
  - One additional advantage of cheap rings is that they're conveniently replaceable.
- Consider diamond alternatives:
  - Outside of jewelry experts, cubic zirconium and diamonds are completely indistinguishable.
  - Lab-grown diamonds are even more difficult to distinguish from mined diamonds.
  - Moissanite (silicon carbide) is brighter than diamonds.
- Consider setting alternatives:
  - Most of the time, you can get a cheaper metal as the setting with no visible difference.
  - Tungsten is *much* more durable than most other metals, and is often cheaply made.
- Whatever you choose, buy the rings with cash to [haggle more easily](money-4_spending.md).
- An engagement and wedding ring combo usually costs less than individual rings.

## Setting a date

Set a date and time:

- Avoid peak season by setting it in November, January, March, or February outside of Valentine's Day.
- Setting a nearer date makes weddings quicker and lower-stress, but a far-off day gives you the advantage of seasonal sales.
- Instead of Saturday, set it on Friday or Sunday or consider a weekday.
- Set the wedding in the afternoon instead of the evening.
- Make a daytime reception and serve lunch or brunch instead of dinner.
- Make the event three hours long instead of five or six.
- Make the reception *after* the ceremony and honeymoon to make the experience more casual.

Ask potential wedding party members whether they can participate on the wedding day.

## Preliminary plans

Whatever you do, do *not* indicate to any service provider that you're planning a wedding.

- A product or service that provides for weddings will often charge 2-5 times more than the exact same thing without the wedding association.

Stay [organized](organization.md) with a checklist and itinerary.

Set a budget:

- Work out a [budget](money-3_budget.md) for the wedding and [honeymoon](fun-vacations.md) that doesn't go too far into [debt](money-2_debt.md).
  - Wedding costs often go up proportionally to how much time between the proposal and the wedding.
  - Most of your expenses will be on others' services, specifically the food, drinks, and venue.
  - Expensive weddings are *always* more stressful than cheaper ones.
- Consider eloping if [money](money-1_why.md) is more important to you than [reputation](people-3_respect.md).
  - Try a middle ground by eloping for the ceremony with a giant reception on a different day.
- To avoid complicating the discussions, only discuss the budget between the two of you before bringing anyone else in.
- Make a list of must-have things.
  - Clarify any necessary venues, decorations, or food that one of you insists on.
- Stick to that budget and try to lower the price on *everything* that isn't a must-have.

Make a guest list:

- Cutting down the guest list, for any part of the wedding, is the easiest way to save money.
  - Bear in mind that only 70-90% of the invited guests will attend, but many will bring a partner.
- Write a list of all possible guests, then prioritize essential guests.
  - Categorize them if you need (his friends, her family, his work, etc.)
  - If you *really* need to, create a mind-map (write each name randomly on a piece of paper, then draw lines to connect them).
  - Make clear rules for invitations to prevent the list from growing too large.
- Invite people who matter to you, not people you feel obligated to invite.
- Calculate the ideal guest range if a venue gives a per-person discount above a certain number.

## Planning the venue and services

Make, borrow, rent or buy used when you can:

- Shop around, compare prices, and get [creative](mind-creativity-how.md) for *everything*.
  - Decorations.
  - [Food](cooking.md), [drinks](fun-alcohol.md), desserts, snacks.
  - Tuxedo and bridal gown, headpiece, veil, gloves, shoes, and jewelry.
  - Bridal party's and groomsmen's outfits.
- Look on social media (especially image boards) for ideas.
- Most stores give enormous discounts on discontinued items.
- When hunting for anything, pay a fraction of the cost by *never* using the word "wedding" with the vendor.

Plan venues for everything:

- Have a plan in mind for the whole experience:
  - Wedding reception
  - Wedding ceremony
  - Honeymoon
  - Bachelor/bachelorette parties
  - Wedding rehearsal after-party
- If you are or know a member of a community organization, you might have access to its venue:
  - Military venues
  - Colleges
  - Churches
  - Community centers
- Avoid conventional locations like nice hotels or mansion courtyards.
- To avoid billable vendor travel time, make the reception and ceremony venues at the same location.
  - Consider a package deal that combines the wedding, reception, and honeymoon venues to save on venue fees.
- Cut down on decorating with a naturally pleasant venue.
- Consider a non-traditional venue that would need tables, toilets, or a kitchen brought in:
  - City-run locales like zoos, civic gardens, and parks
  - Historical sites
  - Favorite restaurants
  - Somewhere personally significant
  - Rural areas not marketed for weddings
- Consider adapting the venue's atmosphere:
  - Make a more laid-back atmosphere like a picnic or brunch.
  - Avoid seat rentals with a standing ceremony, but leave a few seats for the elderly or frail.
- Avoid decorating hastily by showing up at the venue a few days before the wedding day.
- Confirm parking and transportation logistics.
- Schedule a rehearsal time.

Research wedding services:

- Take advantage of the bridal party's, friends', and family's talents.
- Try to avoid high-cost wedding services:
  - Professional calligraphers or painters
  - A destination wedding in a scenic vacation location
  - Specific elements of the ceremony that require additional professional work
- Determine the wedding professionals you'll need, get bids, and sample their work that matches your theme and style:
  - Wedding planner or consultant
    - Get a day-of coordinator instead of a wedding planner.
  - Florist
  - Photographer or videographer
  - Wedding coordinator
  - Officiating pastor
    - If you're not religious, make the officiant a friend willing to get ordained for the occasion.
  - Ushers
  - DJ or musicians
  - Caterers
- Some vendors are willing to travel for no cost, so search beyond your region.
- Ask the venue if they have any preferred vendors that give a referral discount.
- Talk to former brides to find ways to save.
- Look on classified sites like [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/).
- [Negotiate](people-conflicts-negotiation.md) with *everyone*.
  - Use a non-wedding price for their service as your baseline cost.
  - During the consultation with service providers, don't look too trusting.
  - Look for sales and discounts by signing up for vendor newsletters and following them on social media.
  - Request discounts for referrals, feedback or bundled services.

  - To compensate for overtime charges, book an extra hour than you expect.
- Try to get bundled services when possible.
  - Get videos with the photographer.
  - Hire the music for both the ceremony and reception.
- If you know other couples getting married, try sharing costs by coordinating weddings on the same day at a different time.
- Cut down the billable rate or time:
  - Cut assistants from the package.
  - Find a good servicer's associate/assistant that charges less.
  - Consider hiring a photography/film school student.

  - Only keep the videographer for necessary video work.
  - Ask for digital-only photography, then print them later yourself.

  - Hire a string quartet from a local music conservatory or a classical music teacher.
  - Scale down the band's size and use staging tricks to give more presence.
  - Hire a singer who plays an instrument instead of a group.
