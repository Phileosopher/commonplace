# Team building models

## 7-S framework

The model breaks apart and independently analyzes aspects of an organization:

- Strategy - [purposes](purpose.md) and how the organization gets to them.
- Structure - agreed-upon organizational order.
- Systems - informal [habits](habits.md) the group has adopted.
- Shared Values - shared group [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md).
- Style - the [culture](people-culture.md) behind everyone acting.
- Staff - the specific members themselves and their roles.
- Skills - qualified [specializations](jobs-specialization.md) of the members.

## Belbin team roles

Helps define roles into 9 domains based on comparative [personality](personality.md) assessments.

Thought-Oriented

- Monitor Evaluator - fact-based decision-maker
- Specialist - niche understanding of technical facts, often serves as an advisor
- Plant - [creative](mind-creativity.md) idea-maker, often works alone

Action-Oriented

- Shaper - extrovert focused on influencing others to action
- Implementer - practical-minded, accomplishes task lists
- Completer/Finisher - introverts who test and finalize things

People-Oriented

- Coordinator - high-agreeableness focused on influencing others to agreeing to objectives
- Team Worker - effective [listener and communicator](language-speaking.md) who seeks group harmony
- Resource Investigator - extrovert who finds new resources and social connections

## Margerison-McCann team management profile

First, the system asks questions that explore how an individual prefers to work:

- Relating to others
- Gathering and using information
- Making decisions
- Organizing themselves and others

Then, they group people based on their preferences:

1. Demarcate between Explorers and Controllers (EC)
2. Demarcate between Advisors and Organizers (AO)

The result should be a graph indicating their general tendencies toward approximate types of social interaction:

1. Linker (mid-EC, mid-AO)
   - Enjoys connecting everyone with everyone else
   - i.e., all managers
   - Everyone performs the Linker role, but it's particularly important for the leader to stay in that role
2. Reporter-Advisor (mid-EC, A)
   - Enjoys giving and gathering information
   - e.g., researcher
3. Creator-Innovator (A, E)
   - Enjoys finding new ideas and different approaches to tasks
   - e.g., artist
4. Explorer-Promoter (E, mid-AO)
   - Enjoys exploring possibilities and finding new opportunities
   - e.g., philosopher
5. Assessor-Developer (E, O)
   - Enjoys analyzing new opportunities and making them happen
   - e.g., event planner
6. Thruster-Organizer (mid-EC, O)
   - Enjoys guiding people toward making results
   - e.g., manager
7. Concluder-Producer (C, O)
   - Enjoys systematically making outputs

8. Controller-Inspector (C, mid-AO)
