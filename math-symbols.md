# Math symbols list

Most of the challenges with math come from the complexities of the symbols. It's effectively a different language, with its own logical rules that define all of its symbols.

Each of the symbols denote a concept, and learning math creates a cumulative codex that draws from most of the previous symbols to communicate an idea.

## Mathematical state

±

- Indicates the number is either positive or negative
- Can often indicate a range of values
- e.g., 5 ± 2 is an unknown value somewhere between 3 and 7

∓

- Indicates the inverse sign of ±, where it's + when ± is - and - when ± is +

|□|

- The absolute value of a number (i.e., how far it is from 0), which always gives a positive number
  - e.g., |-5| = 5
- Can also refer to the number of elements in a set (i.e., "cardinality")
  - e.g., |5,4,2| = 3
- Can also refer to the length of a line segment along with d(A,B)
  - e.g., |AB|

## Comparison between values

=

- Equality, where two things are effectively the same quantities
- e.g., 2 + 2 = 4

≠

- Inequality, where two things are *not* the same quantities
- e.g., 2 + 2 ≠ 5

≈

- Approximately equal, where two things are *almost* the same quantities
- e.g., 22 / 3 ≈ 7

≡ (aka triple bar)

- Identity, an indication of "if an only if"
- e.g., "Hat **≡** Hat", but not "Hat **≡** hat"

≅

- Isomorphism, where two things are effectively equal, but in different ways

<

- Less than, represents that it's certainly unequal (strict inequality) and the former is less than the latter
- e.g., 2 < 3

>

- Greater than, represents that it's certainly unequal and the former is more than the latter
- e.g., 3 > 2

≤

- Less than or equal to, sometimes uses ≦
- can also be *much* less than (≪), which isn't always clearly defined

≥

- Greater than or equal to
- can also be *much* greater than (≫), which isn't always clearly defined

~

- A general-use symbol that can mean "approximately equal" or "same order of magnitude"

≺ and ≻

- Indicates an order or preorder (in order theory)

□:□

- A ratio between two numbers

%

- A per cent (□/100) amount relative to another value

‰

- A per mille (□/1000) amount relative to another value

## Basic arithmetic

+

- Addition, which is combining two numbers together
- e.g., 1 + 2 = 3

- Subtraction, which is removing the following number from the preceding
- e.g., 3 - 1 = 2

x, - or *

- Multiplication, which is adding a number over and over a certain number of times
- e.g., 2 x 4 = 8

/ or **÷**

- Division, which is indicating how many times the latter number fits into the former number
- e.g., 7 / 2 = 3.5

**:**

- Indicates a ratio of quantities, which is a relationship of relative size
- e.g., 2:3

## Advanced arithmetic

x^y (aka superscript)

- Exponents, which are multiple iterations of multiplication
- e.g., 2^3^ = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8
- Can also be represented by ^ symbol (e.g., 2^3) when superscript isn't easily available

√ (aka radical symbol)

- Square root, which is the value that will become the source number when multiplied together
- e.g., √9 = 3
- Similar to exponents, superscript can also indicate cube roots (∛), fourth roots (∜), and so on

## Set theory

∅

- An empty set
- Can also be represented by { }

#

- Number sign, with 3 possible indications:
  1. With #*S* as the number of elements, may alternatively represent as |S|
  2. With *n*# as the sum of prime numbers up to *n* (i.e., primorial)
  3. With *M#N*, the topological connected sum of two manifolds or knots

∈

- Set membership
- Can read as "is in", "belongs to", or "is a member of"

∉

- Not a member of a set
- Reads as "is not in" (e.g., *x* ∉ *S* means ¬(*x* ∈ *S*)
