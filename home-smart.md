# Smart home upgrades

This is a list of legitimately worthwhile smart home upgrades.

- Many of the smart home features are utterly worthless [to anyone who isn't enamored with tech for tech's sake](https://trendless.tech/trends/).

As a general set of rules:

- Have a specific use in mind for the product: don't buy the product and *then* figure out how to use it.
- Simpler is better, since there are less [complexities that could break down the signals](https://adequate.life/fix/).
- Don't worry as much about [computer networks](networks-cs.md) that "soft" shutdown things as much as things that properly turn power off and on.
- Every new network-connected device is another opportunity for a [hacker](computers-cysec-pentest.md).

## Power outlets

Remote-controlled

- Control lights
- Activate rooms
- Use as a signal for someone communicating across the home
- Power cycle what you need (e.g., router, printer)

Motion-sensing

- Activate air purifier after cat uses litterbox
- Deactivate HVAC if nobody is in the room

Remote *and* motion-sensing

- An all-in-one solution, but no real use for both of them in any implementation

Noise-sensing

- Technology invented in 1984 as The Clapper that detects clapping noise
- Very useful for entering any room

### Outlet timers

Mechanical

- Easily configurable with mechanical pins to activate or deactivate
- Typically only used for Christmas lights and sprinkler systems
- However, can also be used for morning and evening routines, automatic nighttime shutdown, evening humidifer, and more

Digital

- Less reliable than mechnical, but quicker to reprogram

Countdown

- Useful for limited-use things like lights, air purifiers, and heaters

Temperature-controlled

- Turns on or off at certain temperatures
- Useful for HVAC and [gardening](horticulture.md)

## Lighting

Light sockets

- Can be remote-controlled or motion-sensing
- Motion-sensing light sockets tend to be unwieldy and not work correctly

Light bulbs

- Can be remote-controlled or motion-sensing
- Ideal motion-sensing solution: it detects what it then illuminates

## Doors

Door alarm/reminder

- Can be programmed to immediately go off or after a delay
- Great for indicating when a door opens (e.g., garage) or when a door stays open (e.g., refrigerator)

Digital locks

- A key fob is convenient, but is another [security](security.md) vector, meaning less safe

## Other

Motorized shades/blinds

- Not very practical to automate with weather or time of day except for very specific use cases

Robot vacuum

- Can be very convenient, but also runs the chance of [giving a map of the floor plan of your home to Big Tech](faang.md)
