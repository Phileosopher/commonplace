Let's look at rights from a different perspective:

1. Rights are God-given, bestowed implicitly as inherent liberties that give people the freedom to act.
2. While mankind can bestow more privileges (e.g., free food), their most effective means of getting people to act is to take away rights.
3. Therefore, the entire criminal justice system is built around taking away rights, and the entire civil justice system is built around paying lawyers tons of money to enforce one's own rights.
