# How we make decisions

A decision is the closest component we can ever get to what we call a "[soul](humanity.md)", and is the mechanism that defines anything we call "intelligent" or "human".

We tend to judge our [identity](identity.md) by our decisions when they yield positive [results](results.md), but lean more into our [circumstances](reality.md) when we experience [hardship](hardship.md) (a product of [guilt and shame](mind-feelings-shame.md)). However, we tend to [believe](understanding-certainty.md) the opposite in others: their decisions are *not* their identity when they're succeeding, while their decisions are *entirely* who they are when they fail.

We are *constantly* deciding things. When we were little, nearly all our decisions were conscious. However, we quickly developed many [habits](habits.md) automatically, and those decisions were pushed into the subconscious. In a single day, the average adult makes about 35,000 decisions, though we're only aware of about 100 of them.

Contrary to how it may [seem](image.md), decision-making is far more of a strain on our willpower than actually [*doing* most things](results.md).

As we develop [habits](habits.md) from infancy onward and our [identity](identity.md) grows, we subconsciously conform to an identity with further decisions and [changes](people-changes.md) without [awareness](awareness.md) of it.

## Willpower

We face [conflicts](conflicts-inner.md) about what we want. If we have *any* conflict about what we [imagine](imagination.md) [doing](results.md) or [believing](understanding-certainty.md), we must deny a [sentiment](mind-feelings.md) to [act](creations.md) toward a repeat of that action. "Willpower" is the amount of resistance we must use to make a particular decision.

Every day, we wake up with a certain amount of willpower based on how much we're [certain](understanding-certainty.md) about what we can do. Over the day, we can refresh that [certainty](understanding-certainty.md) through affirmations or rest, but that willpower reserve will slowly drain until we become incapable of even performing basic [tasks](purpose.md) or resisting *any* [substance](addiction-substances.md).

We can build our willpower with [habits](habits.md) that push our limits. That reserve of willpower is a universal component of *any* task, though there are broad [value-based](values.md) variances in how it applies (e.g., patience versus strength).

Our willpower reserve is connected with our animal capacity for brainpower, which is based on sugar levels (glucose) in the brain. We can either make it run for longer through endurance, change our diet to fuel it better, and [sleep enough](sleep.md) to keep it running optimally.

## Unconscious

Our framework of information can often be shoddy and [untrustworthy](understanding-certainty.md), but we still must make decisions with it.

Since unconscious decisions are essentially [habits](habits.md) by another name, the word "decisions" usually only refers to the diverging options we consciously select.

There is a spectrum between conscious decisions and habits. Across repetition, decisions become habits through the following mechanism:

1. Experience [perceived facts](reality.md).
2. Condense the information into reasonable [stories](stories.md) that answer ["how", "why", and "what"](understanding.md).
3. The end of the story creates a [feeling](mind-feelings.md) that defines the [purpose](purpose.md) we ascribe to the experience.

We feel comfortable handing off most decisions to the subconscious, except for when that decision either may create [painful](mind-feelings-fear.md) [results](results.md) or makes us feel something [unfamiliar](understanding-certainty.md).

We can profoundly understand the basis of our [personalities](personality.md) by what decisions we obsess over and how much.

## Calculus part 1: values

Every decision is a type of "[values](values.md) calculus" that weighs benefits and risks to any given set of options. It's not strictly [mathematical](math.md) (because it involves non-measrable components associated with [feelings](mind-feelings.md)), but every decision incorporates *many* possible factors based on pre-existing [bias](mind-bias.md) from [cultural experience](culture.md) and [belief](understanding-certainty.md).

A. general factors:

- The [impression](image.md) we get and our reactions to it.
- [Short-term](logic.md) versus [long-term](imagination.md) effects of almost everything.
- Every one of the possibilities we can [imagine](imagination.md), including "[third options](mind-creativity.md)" that often require more [risk](safety.md).
- The shortage of a specific resource (i.e., "[scarcity](economics.md)").

B. [comfort](mind-feelings.md) factors:

- How much pain or pleasure we'll experience. More specifically, how intense, [likely](imagination.md), and how far in the future. We tend to feel more pain from losing things than from never having had those things.
- Who and what we [trust](trust.md), and how much.
- How much that pain or pleasure will create *other* pain or pleasure.
- How much [effort](results.md) we'd have to do to complete something.
- What we're already [familiar](habits.md) with and accustomed to.
- Who and what we [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md), along with our requirements to [feel](mind-feelings.md) [safe](safety.md).
- Things we [don't know](unknown.md) or imagine potentially not knowing, including things we [imagine](imagination.md) we *can't* know.
- Spontaneous impulse to find [certainty](understanding-certainty.md) in the midst of too much [uncertainty](unknown.md) (which can be from too many choices).

C. [purpose](purpose.md) factors:

- Who and what we [love](people-love.md).
- How much we [trust](trust.md) that various decisions could go according to our [expectations](imagination.md).
- To the degree we care about the [future](imagination.md), how much [time or energy](power-types.md) we can save in the long term.
- [Moral](morality.md) standards and [expected](imagination.md) moral consequences.
- How things may hurt or help others we [identify](identity.md) with, such as those in one of our [groups](groups-member.md).

D. [power](power.md) factors:

- How much power, of [all types](power-types.md), we could gain, lose, or trade out.
- How what other people are doing could affect us.
- Assuming no [addiction](addiction.md), diminishing returns.
- How what we [do](results.md) could [influence](power-influence.md) others.
- The [understanding](understanding.md) we could gain, to the degree of our [curiosity](purpose.md).
- [Technology](technology.md) we can use to [optimize](success-4_routine.md) our [routines](habits.md) or magnify our [work](results.md).
- [Mathematical](math.md) increase in a particular number.

E. factors from other people:

- *Every* aspect of the above, but for other people.
- How much we [love](people-love.md) others versus ourselves, and how much any of the above affect others.

By the end of the values calculus, we've [emotionally](mind-feelings.md) lumped the risks and benefits together into a few broad [patterns](symbols.md), and we will make reactive judgments toward them based on [goals](purpose.md) we have in our minds at that moment.

## Calculus part 2: priorities

If the judgment isn't inherently obvious beyond [uncertainty](understanding-certainty.md), we'll devote energy to finding more information to confirm, or to find [alternative solutions](mind-creativity.md) that harmonize everything we want. *Most* decisions are automatic [habits](habits.md), but a critical 1-5% of them that enter our conscious awareness *will* define our future.

Finding new approaches sometimes works, but we can sometimes overlook *other* [unknown](unknown.md) [risks](safety.md) we hadn't thought of if we don't consult [other people](people-conversation.md). At this point, we've simply become aware of various options, though, so there *is* nobody else unless we're [praying to a deity](religion.md).

Most of our prioritization is based on comparison. Even when it's a [mathematical](math.md) reality, we adapt the information from how it compared to previous information in our memory and new information in our memory we've recently perceived.

We frequently compare ourselves with others, though [it makes very little sense to do so](personality.md), and entire [social groups](groups-member.md) are often *defined* by this comparison aspect.

Except for [principles](understanding-certainty.md), we tend to choose the path of least resistance. However, some principles are *also* the path of least resistance if we've [trained](understanding-certainty.md) our minds to them.

When we consider more aspects of [power](power.md), we tend to think more [selfishly](morality-evil.md). Otherwise, if we don't think about them (or use a principle or [love toward others](people-love.md) to disregard them), we become more [altruistic](morality.md).

Even with training, we tend to weigh anecdotal evidence that incorporates many [feelings](mind-feelings.md) than others' hard, concrete [scientific](science.md) evidence. The only way to fix the discrepancy is by feeling that science ourselves, but accomplishing that requires tremendous [wisdom](understanding.md) (especially when many other people have reason to [distort the truth](image-distortion.md)).

When we're very [inexperienced](maturity.md), we tend to underestimate the resources we need. However, once we've amassed enough [wisdom](understanding.md), we'll often risk *over*estimating resources. The most precise way to [predict](imagination.md) resource use is from remembering and correctly applying [results](results.md) from the past that have a similar context. Even then, [we can never be fully sure](unknown.md).

We tend to more frequently avoid bad consequences than pursue more advantageous consequences. However, we invert it and take *tremendous* risks when we [feel](mind-feelings.md) we have nothing left to lose (e.g., surviving, [addiction](addiction.md)).

## Calculus part 3: execution

At the end of weighing our decision, it will go one of two ways:

1. Consider, [observe](image.md), or [analyze](logic.md) more. [Creating](creations.md) models to analyze or [measure](math.md) (e.g., spreadsheets or graphs) is the attempt to more deeply [understand](understanding.md) by adding information to a [perspective](image.md).
2. Decide toward [outward action](results.md) or inaction.

Our calculations are critical because of opportunity cost. Every decision we *can* take to gain [power](power.md) will cost us [other opportunities](power-types.md) to take it, and even *free* things cost time or energy. We tend to hate giving up options and will often maintain our freedom to decide, *long* after it is [reasonable](logic.md).

Even with the above-stated variables, our calculation is typically not very thorough. We tend to attribute the cause for why we do things *after* we experience [results](results.md) from those decisions, but forget that we were acting mostly on [intuition](mind-feelings.md) at the time we decided.

We tend to keep investing into what we had already invested in, even when it makes no sense. This is a product of [habitual familiarity](habits.md), as well as the [belief](understanding-certainty.md) that our decision may turn to a positive end sometime in the [unknown future](unknown.md).

Generally, as we grow older, we become *much* more deliberate in the decisions that lead to actions. Even fools don't like revisiting things they know [guarantee](understanding-certainty.md) pain with zero benefits to it.

### Stress

We tend to make worse decisions when we're stressed, proportional to how much we let [feelings](mind-feelings.md) take over our decision-making. Our IQ drops about 20-40 points if we're [sleep-deprived](sleep.md) or [temporarily emotional](mind-feelings.md).

These feelings come from many sources, and aren't always connected directly with our decision:

- General [unhappiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md) from the situation or [past trauma](hardship-ptsd.md).
- Far too many decisions to choose from, which can often come from modern [technology](technology.md)/[marketing](marketing.md).
- Something beyond our control which we can [sense](mind-feelings.md) but don't [know](understanding.md) about.
- Decision fatigue, which is stress from chronic [uncertainty](understanding-certainty.md) with many decisions.
- New things we're [unfamiliar](habits.md) with, to the degree they [scare](mind-feelings-fear.md) us.
- Things we [interpret](image.md) may make us lose [power](power.md).
- Actions we [observe](image.md) or [do](results.md) that are [improper](rules.md) or [taboo](morality-taboo.md).

Stress can frequently "strip away" new habits and force us to regress back to the desires from when we were *much* younger. At that point, people will select chocolate cake over fruit salad, fall back into long-abandoned [addictions](addiction.md), make rude remarks over [propriety](people-rules.md), and make [self-interested](morality-evil.md) choices over selfless ones.

More variety of choices means we'll have a harder time deciding from the extra mental effort, and making difficult decisions tends to give us less [satisfaction](habits.md) than making simple decisions. Eventually, too many choices can simply make our minds shut down entirely about the matter, and we'll grab something on an impulse to make the [problem](purpose.md) go away.

In other words, every choice has its benefits and downsides, and we become progressively better at deciding, up to a breaking point. At that point, our capacity for decision-making becomes no better than pure randomness, or we will simply decide *not* to decide at that point.

The more we think about a decision, the more [important](meaning.md) that decision [feels](mind-feelings.md) to us, and the more stress we feel from deciding. Once we've reached the breaking point, we become *worse* at making clear decisions from a [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) the decision won't pay out what we invested in it.

Most [influential](power-influence.md) people take the most advantage of others' stress, with their effort focused on adding stress to what they don't want them to select and removing stress from what they'd prefer them to select. This can be through [creating results](results.md) to that end, or simply the [appearance](image-distortion.md) of it.

## Calculus part 4: certainty

Generally, people mull over decisions until they reach a certain degree of [certainty](understanding-certainty.md), which varies by [personality](personality.md) and [maturity](maturity.md). While it's impossible to be error-free, we have a remarkable ability of being relatively low-error in our [understanding](understanding.md) if we're patient and [thorough](science.md).

Mulling over decisions can't satisfy us, mostly because more [thinking](logic.md) leads to a smaller likelihood of feeling comfort with the answer. At the same time, we're more likely to come to the best possible decisions.

We need certainty proportionally to the scope of the [consequences](results.md) we [predict](imagination.md) for a decision. Choosing a hamburger or chicken sandwich is merely a matter of [preference](decisions.md), but choosing to [change jobs](jobs-1_why.md) or work for a promotion can affect *years* of a lifestyle.

The way we form our certainty has a profound impact on how we [perform](results.md). If we [feel](mind-feelings.md) we're forced to do something (e.g., from [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md)), we're *far* less resourceful or responsive to [reality](reality.md) than when we feel we [purposed](purpose.md) ourselves to a decision. We also don't commit to any decision if we think we can reverse that decision at any given moment.

We may consult [friends](hardship-friends.md) or an [expert](jobs-specialization.md), which allows us several opportunities:

1. We can more clearly [understand](understanding.md) the likely consequences of our decisions through another [perspective](image.md).
2. We don't feel like we're entirely [responsible](meaning.md) for the decision we ultimately make, since their advice guided it.
3. Our relationship with that [friend](hardship-friends.md) or [institution](groups-large.md) is strengthened.
4. In the case of an expert and [their institution](groups-large.md), we can learn whether they are [trustworthy](trust.md) for future decisions.

However, any expert or friend has [limitations](mind-bias.md) and [interests](purpose.md) that may go against our own best interests compared to deciding something ourselves. And, if we trust others too much, we'll start feeling helpless, which devastates our capacity for finding [meaning](meaning.md).

If we *are* an [expert](jobs-specialization.md) in something, we have a tendency to overestimate our competence. When something is merely a [theory](imagination.md) we [believe](understanding-certainty.md) in, we'll often assert it as a [fact](reality.md) ([Dunning-Kruger Effect](mind-bias.md)). Further, when it's beyond our scope of experience, we frequently overstep what we know and presume our [patterns](symbols.md) will still apply.

The precise moment we've decided, we're finished with our [purpose](purpose.md) of thinking about it. We tend to mostly delegate it to our focus and [habits](habits.md) to execute, and carry on to another [thought](imagination.md) or [experience](reality.md).

In the long term, deciding leans one of two ways:

1. It's a similar pattern to the decisions we'd made before, and solidifies a [habit](habits.md).
2. It's a new form of decision we *hadn't* made before, and it makes us [change](people-changes.md).

The cause for *why* we decide on something has a tremendous impact on how we interpret that decision's [results](results.md):

- How [personally responsible](meaning.md) we feel we are for deciding, versus doing what someone else told us to do.
- The amount we believe our decisions *can* make [reality](reality.md) change.
- Whether we're focusing on what we're [afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md) of or what we [love](people-love.md) that first inspired that fear.
