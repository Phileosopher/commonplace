The Lamp

(Matthew 5:14-16)

Summary:

You're the world's light, and enough light (i.e., a city on a hill) is impossible to hide.

Nobody turns on a light and puts it under a basket, and instead set it somewhere prominent to give light.

In the same way, show your light to people so they see your good actions and give your Father His reputation.

Meaning:

Relatively self-explanatory.

Controversies:

The passage is uncontroversial, but how to show the light without demonstrating conceit is the difficult part.

The Speck & The Log

(Matthew 7:1-5)

Summary:

Judge others according to the measure others have judged you.
