## what Christians can miss

the Christian culture will end up emphasizing some things more than others
- this can create risks
- often, it's in proportion to its "marketability"

e.g., 1 co 13 was sandwiched inside 1 co 12-14, talking about spiritual gifts

(look at other "inspiring Bible verses" that get slung around)

this isn't that their ideas are WRONG, but that they're incomplete

## the combination of things to do

reference the 2 peter aspect (supply to your faith patience etc)

false doctrines:
- experientialism
- intellectualism
- emotionalism

they all harmonize with each other
- emotionalism/spirituality
- theology/intellect
- ritual/discipline

we need all three of them
- no emotionalism = Christian stoicism
- no theology/intellect = a world of false doctrines (e.g., moralistic therapeutic deism)
- no rituals = no grounding, and one of the other

Name the gods that everyone still worships
A. find a list of old gods
B. find modern connections to those gods
    e.g., the worship of Big Pharma or the medical system is worshiping Asclepius

The substance is not the problem
The problem is the wound we need healing from
We must stare deep into that wound and let the love of Jesus fill it
