
Make the book of Psalms, but rhyming poetically in English

TODO:
1. update "metadata" from first section
2. add headings from the following
    - https://www.easyenglish.bible/bible/easy/psalm/1/
    - https://biblehub.com/esv/psalms/1.htm

PERMUTATION:
emotionless psalms
give a summary of psalms in 1-2 sentences



This is a simple attempt to make all the Psalms poetically rhyme in English.

I've taken creative liberties to reduce the ideas into something that "flows" in English. The focus is on keeping the ideas as close to the original as possible, but that's not always easy.

Since it has [open licensing] and is easy to read, the original basis is the World English Bible.
