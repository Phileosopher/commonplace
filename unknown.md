# The state of the unknown

We don't [know](understanding.md) most things. We start [from before birth](maturity.md) by knowing practically nothing, but are curious to find out and quickly make [purposes](purpose.md) to discover things.

Very soon (often within a few months), something we didn't know will have hurt us. From that point, we live [fearing](mind-feelings-fear.md) "the Unknown". As we gain experiences, this compounds as we discover new forms of the Unknown that may hurt us. If we don't, our recklessness will tend to get us killed while we're still [young](maturity.md).

Most of our efforts in life are in conquering the Unknown. Most of our [creations](creations.md) are either attempts to make us [feel](mind-feelings.md) things more accurately about the Unknown, or to minimize pain from what the Unknown may bring. [Science](science.md) is a powerful method of reducing the Unknown.

We can never completely remove the Unknown. Death is the greatest Unknown, and also one of our greatest [fears](mind-feelings-fear.md) for that reason. Every [religion](religion.md) is an attempt to answer the Unknown, and all aspects of theology are attempts to make sense of God(s) that are the very essence of that Unknown (since we certainly know very little about the entirety of anything that is God).

Even complete [understanding](understanding.md) isn't exempt from the Unknown. As time deteriorates memory, all we understand becomes more of that Unknown. [Habits](habits.md) become the Unknown across time as we forget the [decisions](decisions.md) that drove them, but we [deceive](image.md) ourselves to be [certain](understanding-certainty.md) of it because the [consequences](mind-creativity-results.md) feel [familiar](identity.md).

We are stubborn, though, and we *constantly* conquer the Unknown. Most of our [stories](stories.md) are the [conflict](people-conflicts.md) between the Known and Unknown, with "good" stories being the ones that expanded the Known or defeated the Unknown. We also embody the Unknown as a [symbol](symbols.md) of a [monster](stories-myths.md), with the hero as the one who defeats the Unknown.

Frequently, how the Unknown is conquered is a [pattern](symbols.md) the [creator](creations.md) is attempting to communicate as a portion of living the [good life](goodlife.md).

[Artists](mind-creativity.md) tend to draw from the raw Unknown. [Analysts](logic.md) tend to make the artists' works into more ordered things to make them more [useful](purpose.md).

## Chaos

We [believe](understanding-certainty.md) something to have order when we've distinctly separated [values](values.md) in our mind, especially as we perceive our [environment](reality.md).

We interpret *anything* we don't directly [understand](understanding.md) as chaos. It may be from a lack of information connected to a purpose that affects us, or the [story](stories.md) we [perceive](image.md) conflicts with our [expectations](imagination.md) (e.g., a messy room or a cluttered sentence).

We treat completely unordered chaos as bad, but it's nothing more than pure randomness that sometimes works [against what we want](purpose.md), and it can work in our favor just as much.

Our minds naturally repel chaos and strive for order when we [perceive](image.md), but this operates from an opposing point from the inherent state of nature.

- [Nature itself](reality.md) is inherently chaotic, with a semi-maintained semblance of order contained within it (e.g., how rivers form).
- We, in [our humanity](humanity.md), are the opposite: inherently ordered, with a semi-deconstructed chaotic element contained within it.

Anytime we develop "two" things instead of "one", it forms some degree of unknown by the strict necessity of our need to [divide it](logic.md).

While it's not inherently obvious, we find [meaning](meaning.md) in making order out of chaos, proportionally to our [conscientiousness](personality.md). Complete order is boring to us, and complete chaos overwhelms us, so there's always a balance that leads to [living correctly](goodlife.md).

## Severity

Contrary to what many people [imagine](imagination.md), chaos isn't *complete* disarray. We can generally group chaos into a few broad classes as we observe it:

1. Unknown Order - the order that was created elsewhere beyond our comprehension, such as the mechanisms behind [technology](technology.md), or whatever we envision [God](religion.md) to have created.
2. Natural Chaos - the natural state of [reality](reality.md), which has large-scale general rules but is completely disordered on the small-scale. For example, sand and sticks on a beach will be in disarray, but a desert won't show piles of blood, stones, fish, and snow.
3. "Cthulhu" Chaos - complete disorder, with no rules to define things.

Partial chaos doesn't work well with us, and we tend to treat *any* chaos with distrust, even when we *know* of the Unknown, and that [uncertainty](understanding-certainty.md) frequently interferes with rational [decision-making](decisions.md). The nature of [mnemonics](mind-memory.md) and [symbols](symbols.md) is our mind's attempt to impose patterns onto things without patterns, and [language](language.md) is how we harness the unknown.

Interestingly, as we perceive chaos, Cthulhu Chaos doesn't actually "exist", but our [perceptions](image.md) tend to deceive us to where our [feelings](mind-feelings.md) define Natural Chaos as Cthulhu Chaos.

We tend to demarcate between "man-made" and "natural" by how much order we interpret something to have. A rock is natural, but a statue is man-made. However, [science](science.md) can demonstrate that everything possesses some base sense of order behind all the chaos.

## Ordering

Amazingly, we're so good at making order out of chaos that our self-made [patterns](habits.md) and [symbols](symbols.md) are often *very* reliable in the face of complete chaos.

Unfortunately, we equally run the risk of building superstitions that have no bearing in any legitimate [statistical](math.md) reality.

The only way to differentiate between finding superstition and truth in the fog of what we don't know is to wait until we have a clearer view of it. At that point, we can [scientifically](science.md) prove whether we were deriving a reliable pattern or not.

Further, when we form order incorrectly, there are only two ways to fix it:

1. Adhere to *another* form of order instead.
2. Dismantle the order we had built, which is [emotionally](mind-feelings.md) difficult because we'll feel we [pursued](purpose.md) a wasted effort and invites back the chaos we had formed the order to avoid in the first place.

## Time

[Time](datetime.md) is a unique element of the Unknown that perpetually interferes with our daily existence:

1. Things happen and we vividly remember them.
2. We slowly forget what happened, but hold on to information that might be [useful](purpose.md) later.
3. We use that information to craft what we perceive [into the future](imagination.md), correcting errors as we get more reliable.
4. Eventually, we can live our daily lives with the well-known present, alongside the fading past and imaginary future.

How we prioritize these 3 perspectives (past/present/future) affects almost everything in our lives:

Past ("what was")

- [Traditional](culture.md), [religious](religion.md), and [conservative](politics-conservativeliberal.md)
- Stable sense of [self](identity.md)
- Oriented toward [family](people-family.md) and [groups](groups-member.md), distrusts strangers
- Tend to be more [prejudiced](understanding-certainty.md)
- Focus on [obligations and commitments](people-contracts.md)
- [Rituals](culture.md) and [myths](stories-myths.md) have [meaning](meaning.md)
- Dominant feeling of [guilt](mind-feelings-shame.md)
- Avoids [risks](socialrisk.md) and adventures
- Often more [cooperative than competitive](people-conflicts.md)

Present ("what is")

- Concrete > abstract
- Harder to [resist temptations](addiction.md) or wait, easier to procrastinate
- Focus on bringing pleasure and avoiding pain
- Often poorer [health management](body-4_health.md) and [substance abuse](addiction.md)
- [Understanding](understanding.md) might not deter actions
- Seeks more sensation and novelty, less [emotionally stable](mind-feelings.md) and more [risk-taking](socialrisk.md), more likely to [lie](people-lying.md)
- Tend to be [poor](classes.md) or [uneducated](education.md)
- Seeks instant gratification, lower grades in [school](education.md)
- Typically [fun](fun.md) to be around

Future ("what will/might be")

- [Goal-oriented](success-4_routine.md), works harder
- [Saves money](money-3_budget.md) and resources more
- [Results-oriented](mind-creativity-results.md), and cooperative/competitive to that end
- More often [health-conscious](body-4_health.md)
- Trouble having [fun](fun.md)
- Trouble with spontaneity and [relationships](people-4_friends.md)
- Generally lower anxiety, but concern for the future can create anxiety
- Tends to be [addicted to work](addiction.md) and have [midlife crises](maturity.md)
- Tend to be more [conscientious](morality.md), less aggressive, more [emotionally stable](mind-feelings.md), and more [creative](mind-creativity.md)

Our [personality](personality.md) dictates this balance, but those personalities are driven by how we frame the risks of the different parts of the Unknown:

1. The Present is the most known we have, and the basis for all [phenomenology](mind-feelings.md) and anything we can actually call [reality](reality.md), but also isn't very [useful](purpose.md) by itself.
2. The Past is the second-most known we have, proportional to how near it is to us in time and how reliable our memories are. It also represents some of the worst qualities that we need to [change](people-changes.md), and we run the risk of falling behind the [trends](trends.md).
3. The Future is the least known possible, and represents many possibilities based on many parts of what we don't know. However, it's also where we [accomplish things](mind-creativity-results.md) and find the most [meaning](meaning.md). Unfortunately, it's also devastating to our [relationships](people-friends.md) with others and too much focus on it can destroy [society](culture.md).

## Scaling order

Because order is a value, it can compound on itself to establish an elaborate system. However, we only interpret order when it accomplishes a [purpose](purpose.md) we [expect](imagination.md). If that thing fails the expectation (such as a broken-down car) we tend to believe it's "out of order", even though it's often still 99.999% *in* order.

[Civilization](culture.md) is a type of social order, with [inspiration](creations.md), [groups](groups-member.md), and [technology](technology.md) that all form from baser components. We can spend so much time [engaging](understanding.md) with it, though, that we forget the entire thing is built on nature. [On the political spectrum](politics-conservativeliberal.md), conservatives try to preserve order that has already been created while liberals try to create new order.

Destroying order without another type of proven order to replace it is often [evil](morality-evil.md), and usually [risky](safety.md). We are prone to mistaking others destroying as mindless when they're attempting to [recreate reality](creations.md) differently. It takes [humility and patience](morality.md) to [understand](understanding.md) others' motivations, which is venturing into an unknowable domain because people [lie](people-lying.md).

## Scaling chaos

Every aspect of order also creates some amount of chaos through the new domain of Unknown attached to the known domain.

For that reason, chaos can build recursively into systems as order builds. At any time, increases in order can bring about latent chaos to bring about a type of destruction of everything that had been established.
