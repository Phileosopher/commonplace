# How to have fun with children

You can teach *anything* to children through fun and play:

- Children understand most lessons if you can [creatively](mind-creativity-how.md) merge them with play.
- Your purpose is to teach them better judgment, *not* to be obedient.

Playing is a child-specific "love language" for communicating and expressing their [feelings](mind-feelings.md).

- While adults work through their feelings by talking, children unleash them by using their bodies to play.

- A child's play is how they experiment and learn about the world, and broken bones heal more easily than [timidity and fear](mind-feelings-fear.md).
- All children's games are about [connecting](people-1_why.md) with others (e.g., chase, tag, hide-and-seek, follow the leader).

Initiate physical contact with them lightly or ask a simple question, then work off of their behavior.

- To make up for the fact that they're small, give them more control of the situation.

Children are happy to play with whatever you choose, which is necessary for you to enjoy the experience with them.

- If you discourage a child from playing, they'll create emotional barriers in their mind to separate themselves from the rest of the world.
- Without learning to play, children will emotionally shut down or burst into tears at the slightest upset.
- Let them win to help them feel more confident about their ability to [succeed](success-1_why.md).

The best way to make a connection with your children is to play with them:

- Children tend to prefer playing with their parents because the parents relent and let them win, which teaches them how to [tactfully](people-3_respect.md) behave with others by example.

Learn to redirect their attention with a playful voice to direct them to productive, good purposes.

- Children severely differentiate between hearing you playfully or fiercely say "Oh no, you don't!" and "That's not where that goes!"
- Kissing is redirected biting, and caressing is redirected hitting.
- Instead of harshly enforcing a boundary, make the entire experience a game.

When you see them extremely emotional (shaking, trembling, laughing, crying), stop there and let the emotions subside, then advance further with what they're afraid of once they've composed themselves.

Teach valuable lessons through play that would normally be lectures.

- Speak loudly about something being a secret.
- Make an [organizing](organization.md) game to help them [clean up](home-housekeeping.md).
- Make pretend games to confront whatever they're afraid of.
- Pretend to be scared of absolutely everything.
- Let them physically wrestle out a problem they had earlier that day, with you being the problem.
- If there's something they're not supposed to do that isn't dangerous, try to get them to *do it* instead.

Teach [active listening](language-speaking.md) by assigning speaker/listener roles and having the listener summarize the speaker.

- You can also assign a watcher to provide feedback on both as well.
- Make a "speaking catch" game:
  1. Prepare at least three general questions that interest the child or children.
  2. The child who holds the ball throws it and asks a question
  3. The next child must catch the ball and answer with more than a few words.
  4. The child can only speak for 30 seconds, then asks another question and throws the ball.

Being silly takes practice because you have to violate most of the [social rules](people-rules.md) you were trained to honor.
- You'll look silly to other adults when you interact, climb, and run with children, especially when you're the only one.
- When frustrated, make a mock threat that turns the situation into play.

## Constantly look for new ways for them to play

If you can't think of any games you want to play, make them up by creating a "winner" and "loser".

- Flip a coin and give an overly dramatic death scene if it's tails and a huge victory dance if it's heads.
- When they mispronounce a word, repeat it *exactly* the way they spoke, then keep using increasingly silly ways to say it.
- Pretend to be an ox, and the child has to pull you over a line in the grass.

## Play with them for the right reason
 
Be careful with status-enhancing activities:

- Your activities should grow and add [meaning](meaning.md) to your children, not necessarily *your* social status.

If a child doesn't want something (e.g., baseball league), try to understand exactly why they don't want it.

- Children may want something, then discover later they don't like it because they're afraid of something or didn't realize how hard it would be.

Sometimes, if you already have [money](money-3_budget.md) invested in the situation, you can compromise:

  - Have them agree to endure the next few months, then cancel the activity.
  - Work with them to help sell what you bought.
  - Have them work an agreed amount to pay off what you had to pay.
