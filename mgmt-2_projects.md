# How to make projects

There are two ways to imagine and plan for a project:

1. Assembly - imagine the manifold tasks necessary to perform the project, then work upward into a grander purpose.
2. Work backward - have a grander purpose, then work backward into the necessary manifold tasks.

When it's possible, the first is ideal.

- It needs to have been proven elsewhere.
- The project can't be beyond a humanly comprehensible amount of complexity.
- The tasks need to be clearly defined.

The second, however, can be used universally.

- All you need is a vision, even if it's not possible.
- When the situation proves the project impossible to achieve, you *will* need to move the project goals.
- Moving project goals requires both [mental flexibility to change](people-changes.md) and the social skills to [influence others](people-3_boundaries.md) to new truths unveiled as the project carries forward.

## A. Have a vision

Before even *beginning* to dive into projects and [forming teams](mgmt-3_teams.md), build a clear [vision](imagination.md) of what the team will need to do:

- Will the project have many interconnected tasks (and require more [communication](language-speaking.md)), or are each of the tasks relatively independent of each other?
- Is the task relatively straightforward, or more abstract?
- What qualitatively or quantitatively defines if the project is a success or failure?
- What rewards will the members receive if they do well at the project?
- What other projects will likely arise if the project is successful? How about if it fails?

Reflect your vision with your lifestyle.

- Your own way of life should reflect on the projects and goals you're aspiring to achieve.
- Associate with other people who constantly [challenge](people-conflicts.md) your ideas.
- Stay [creative](mind-creativity.md), and continually seek out new experiences and new ways to see the world.
- If you don't constantly seek new information and points of view, your group will [influence](power-influence.md) you enough that you'll become stagnant through a leader-member [cultural](people-culture.md) feedback loop.

## B. Establish values

With that idea in place, clarify the values you want to see with your team.

- These values are [philosophical concepts](values.md) that take precedence over other positive (e.g., kindness, strength, curiosity).
  - Often, a [personality](personality.md) which is strong in one area is also weak in another (e.g., bold people tend to be less compassionate).
- Your values will then resonate with the 3 R's:
  1. Recruit - selecting people who share those values.
  2. Reward - promoting people who reflect those values.
  3. Release - letting go of people who *don't* share those values.
- Closely consider the [story](stories.md) of the group and where it came from, since that determines where it'll go next.

Clarify any critical [customs](people-rules.md) or [habits](habits.md) that will reinforce those values.

- You're trying to foster a [culture](people-culture.md) which reinforces the values you believe should show themselves.
- If your team has any [creative](mind-creativity.md) people, the best cultural values you can introduce are *extremely* simple, with the expectation that they will find [meaning](meaning.md) in adding their own flair to it out of boredom.

## C. Pick a system

There are [a variety of existing project systems](mgmt-theories.md) to choose from, and even more if you draw inspiration from [logistics](logistics.md).

## D. Clarify constraints

Every project has specific purposes and constraints:

- You should know *why* every project, as well as projects connected to them, exist.
- Stay aware of the project's final deadline, along with what a perfect project completion would look like.
- Track how much everything will likely cost, the existing [budget](money-3_budget.md), and the consequences for going over budget.

After all that, examine the space you're working in.

- Consider the location and how it'll connect to the [culture](people-culture.md) and work environment.

Consider the project's necessary inputs and outputs:

- Money
- Hours
- Required research
- Ideas
- If it's a [creative](mind-creativity.md) project, the story points, outlines, and key ideas
- If it's [marketing](marketing.md)-based, sales strategies and closed leads
- If it's working with many people, required plans of action for specific events
- If it uses technology, whether it needs [tech management](mgmt-2_projects-cs.md), [existing code](computers-software-versionctrl.md) or [documentation](language-writing-documentation.md)

Make a thorough list of *all* the software, equipment, tools, and supplies everyone will possibly need for the work.

- You're trying to gather as much information as possible about what could possibly be needed.
- Be as cynical as possible to create the ceiling of the necessary resource load.
- If, for whatever reason, you don't expect you'll be able to easily acquire everything, make a note for later in the project to pay closer attention to more scarce resources.

## E. Make plans

[Make goals](success-3_goals.md) that clearly indicate *exactly* what you want.

- The goals should have a clear [logistical methodology](logistics.md) and be legitimately attainable.

Consider all available resources, including more abstract ones:

- Available people
- Ideas
- Positional and temporary advantages
- From a [different perspective](mind-creativity-how.md), most risks can actually be advantages in a different framing (e.g., [unemployment](hardship-unemployment.md) creates available free time).

Start with the larger [goals](success-3_goals.md), then split them into smaller ones.

1. Clearly get your mind around the goals.
   - Write out each objective and what you expect of it as a 250-word paragraph.
   - Set measurable numbers to track each objective.
2. Divide the goals into future periods.
   - Annual objectives are *extremely* large-scale and necessary for long-term planning.
   - Quarterly objectives divide out annual objectives.
   - Monthly and weekly objectives are focused on accomplishing quarterly results.
   - If you have a difficult time imagining 12 months in the future, simply think 3 months out and then extrapolate it 4 times.
3. Make schedules for both a worst-case and best-case scenario.
   - The actual schedule will likely be near the middle.
   - If you're reporting to someone else, give the worst-case projection first, then [negotiate](people-conflicts-negotiation.md) from there.
4. At each interval, update the short-term goals and timing for all future objectives.
   - It can help to track previous periods' projections versus results to better estimate the numbers.
5. Every quarter, compile a summary of achieved objectives.
   - For each objective, write a paragraph articulating whether you achieved it any what everyone learned.
   - Include metrics that most clearly indicate where the group struggled or thrived.
   - Describe precisely how the events happened, as well as how the organization could have done better or continue succeeding.
6. Every year, estimate the next year.
   - The outline of next year's annual report are the previous year's objectives.

## F. Take extra time For human resources

A team of people is more like a small community than any type of system.

- Each person will interact with other people, creating a [group culture](people-culture.md) that frames it as a unique entity.
- Across teams, an organization is more like an ecosystem than a formal structure.

The team's composition adapts further constraints and opportunities:

- Look at everyone's roles and responsibilities, including what people believe about [who is *really* in charge](power-types.md).
- There's usually a maximum [logistical](logistics.md) limit for how often each member is able to meet.

If you've inherited a prior project and team, you're walking into a new culture and your presence will ripple through the entire team.

- Have a transition [speech](language-speaking.md) prepared that will quickly and precisely articulate how you're similar and different from the prior manager.
  - If you don't *know* how the prior manager was, openly ask the members how they and the manager used to do everything.
  - Do *not* presume that the way you did things elsewhere applies here: even highly rigid systems can easily have permutations in [how things get done](habits.md).
- Workplace politics are guaranteed, simply because your [natural disposition](personality.md) will favor people in differing proportion than the last manager.
- Most of the group will *not* adapt quickly to your approach, but the ones who do may simply be [power-hungry](power.md).
