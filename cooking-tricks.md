- Clean large amounts of fruit all at once in the sink:
  1. Fill the sink with water
  2. Add 1 cup (1/4 l) of vinegar and stir.
  3. Add all your fruit (including berries) and let it soak for 10 minutes.
  4. The water will be dirty, the fruits will sparkle without any wax, and they will keep for longer.
- Run a multitude of fruits in the dishwasher without soap.

## Dairy

Refrigerate butter so you can grate it.

Melt margarine or butter for a minute in the microwave instead of burning it on the stove or waiting for it to soften on the counter.

To test if butter is real or artificial, spread it on a piece of paper and light it on fire. While real butter will smell pleasant, artificial butter will smell horrible.

## Meat

Slow cookers can cook anything to tenderness, even tough cuts of meat.

Chicken thighs are typically easier to cook than chicken breasts because they don't dry out.

When scalding a chicken, add a teaspoon of baking soda to the boiling water for the feathers to come off more easily.

When cooking wild game, add baking soda to the water to remove the "gamey" taste from the meat.

Make a marinade by mixing mayonnaise into a spice mixture, and the mayo flavor will disappear when you bake the meat.

## Restoring food

Thoroughly reheat the food to prevent further decomposing:

- Reheat all leftovers to at least 165 °F
- Make a circle in the center of the food when reheating it in the microwave to heat it evenly.
- Cover foods while reheating to ensure they retain their moisture and stay consistently hot.

Frozen foods weighing 5 pounds (2 1/4 kg) or less will typically thaw within 24 hours in the fridge.

Warm plates with a toaster oven instead of a conventional oven:

- Standard ovens have a typical minimum heat setting of 200° F.
- Toaster ovens heat at lower temperatures than most standard ovens.

### Breads/Starches

Frozen sandwiches and baked goods: wrap in a dry paper towel when microwaving to ensure they won't get soggy.

### Meat & Nuts

Casseroles: reheat by cutting vents into wax paper and covering the dish in a microwave.

Seafood: reheat over a long time at a low temperature in an oven.

Lobster: test its freshness by pulling back the tail.

- It's fresh if it snaps back, but it was kept for a few days if it goes back slowly.
