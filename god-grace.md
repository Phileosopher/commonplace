# List of how God is graceful and merciful

This is a list of ways that God is broadly graceful.

- People often aren't creative enough to realize the *many* ways that God would have every right to be more severe.
- To that end, we frequently misinterpret what is happening around us, as if God is delivering His full and readily-delivered wrath on us.

## The Fall

When mankind sinned, God could have destroyed us entirely.
