# Oceanography (cean science) explained

The earth is ~70% covered in water, with the oceans having vast unexplored territories. The deepest place, the Mariana Trench, is over 10,000 meters below sea level!

Generally, scientists as a whole aren't often as interested in oceanography compared to the other sciences, for several reasons:

- Even though there are plenty of sunken ships and fun deep-sea life in it, the oceans as an unexplored territory don't *nearly* capture the [imagination](imagination.md) as much as space exploration (i.e., possible life on other planets is often more interesting than life in high-pressure underwater environments).
- The biodiversity of the oceans is rather samey compared to the earth's land, so it only has ~15% of the species on earth.

Obvious questions that remain unanswered:

- How long are *any* of the coastlines?
- What's at the bottom of the deepest parts of the ocean?
