because of the opinions and preferences of the majority who are NOT [specialized], major market movements always hit the lower-priced parts of the market worse than the boutique range of products

Employment requires a fixed minimum

## Black markets

it's a difficult battle of tradeoffs with illegalizing things

if you make it illegal, it takes resources to enforce
- insufficient enforcement creates a black market
- too much enforcement creates a riot
- giving bounties and rewards gets thr citizens involved, but makes the harmony of the people in general drop (dince everyone becomes a narc)

if you legalize and financially charge for it, other govt departments depend on it for financial solvency
- further, it gives every incentive for a government to market more consumption of that product

attacking its (supply chain) is good, but the black market will rise up elsewhere
