when you want a better service

1. bring the price it reasonably should be
2. they'll ask to bring it down
3. have things you can do already in mind to lower the price
  - less quality parts
  - longer deadline
  - simpler design

## mindset

For sole traders and very small companies, the distinction between innovation and day-to-day delivery is barely noticeable and unimportant. It's all just business, and creative, responsive, flexible business comes easier to you the smaller your operation.

Faced with a choice of doing a job for the money or doing a job for the
fun of it, take the fun one whenever you can.
You'll rarely enjoy the work you do for money.

If the first commercial version of your work excites no one to action,
it's time to move on to something different. Don't be fooled by the
opinions of friends and family.

If your work inspires some excitement and some action from customers,
get ready to chew through some walls. You might have something worth
fighting for.

## pricing models

Don't advertise the free model, but provide it anyway:

- allows for monetizing and free at the same time
- Discussion by dang in thread:

A financial planner raised his fees by 40%. The first year following
that increase, his income increased 65%. Today it's up 150%.
A Canadian decorator charged $75/hr for years. Raised her fee to
$125/hr, and the effect was immediate. Inquiries increased, from people
eager to work with the region's "premier interior decorator". Her
conversion rates improved. Once prospects believed they were dealing
with the area's best decorator - the conclusion they came to from her
fee - they were more apt to say, "When can we start?" Sales took less time.
The fee increase also meant her more affluent clientele paid faster,
more willingly, and without fail.

## selling a car

Tips for private sales of a car:

Always set a time for ALL interested parties: "You can come see the car Saturday between Noon and 3PM. Text me when you are at the parking lot" (it's like an sales showroom open house listing, instead of making 5 random scattered appointments. "First come, first served")

"Any test drives require proof of drivers license and proof of auto liability insurance, no exceptions. Otherwise you can be a passenger while i drive, and i reserve the right to have an security escort". (this dissuades car jackers)

"Yes, you can bring your mechanic"

"CASH ONLY, no trades, no checks"

"Car sold as-is, no warranties expressed or implied : i have listed the condition of the car to the best of my knowledge".

This makes all potential buyers arrive at same day, same place, you camp out there for a couple hours: if more than 1 arrives at a time, they might feel like they have to compete against each other.

And don't be afraid to refuse to negotiate a discount, but politely thank them for their interest. Let them know that you will immediately remove the listing when it sells, so if listing is gone, they lost out.

PS: don't list "OBO"/"Or Best Offer" in your price listing. This only invites sight unseen lowballers who waste your time. Q: "What's the lowest price you will accept?" A: "I'm gonna sell it for the price listed." "If you are interested, show up Saturday between Noon and 3PM. Have a nice day!" (Know what your car is worth beforehand, price accordingly, its a hot market for mid-priced used cars nowadays)

And remember: 'Money Talks, Bullshit Walks…'

EDIT: Was a car salesman for many years. Probably consummated over 500 deals.

2nd Edit: oops, yeah, the word 'consummated' subconsciously slipped out… That's ancient car salesman slang, the old-timer salesguys used to say that word because it meant someone got fucked …

Whenever anyone asks me "what's the least you'll take for it" I always respond with "what's the most you'll pay for it?" If they won't answer I just thank them for their time and tell them I'm not interested in selling for the least amount possible.

## work from home

NOTE: work from home is so ubiquitous that it will likely need to be a separate guide altogether
- will likely go to NAG somewhere
- move success-4 items there
- reference the idea from AL, NAG and TT

Zoom trick: split the video vertically and put your multitask item on the top, and you'll look like you're paying attention to the speaker
