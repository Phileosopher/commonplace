# How to operate an aircraft

Unlike the comparatively simpler task of operating an [automotive](autos.md), aircraft represent risks in more directions:

- With the exception of a glider, there is a very real chance of stalling and freefalling to the ground as soon as the [engine](engineering-engines.md) fails.
- Birds can damage the aircraft if you're not observing where you're going.
- Other aircraft represent collision hazards, which is why every aircraft and their flight path must be registered with the government, as well as comply with [communications](engineering-radio.md) standards.
- Mid-air collision is magnified by visibility and navigation factors from [weather](science-weather.md) (e.g., hail, fog, wind).

To that end, most people should never fly.

- It requires constant alertness and conformity to procedure.
- Further, it requires a proper education in operating an aircraft.

There are several vestibular [illusions](mind-bias.md) (i.e., dizziness) that every pilot must stay perpetually conscious they may be having (acronym ICEFLAGS):

- Inversion - a tumbling backwards sensation, comes from abrupt change from a climb to a level flight
- Coriolis - spinning effect, comes from abrupt head movements while in the middle of a maneuver
- Elevator - feel like being in a climb or descent, comes from abrupt vertical acceleration (i.e., updrafts/downdrafts)
- False horizon - incorrectly aligning the craft, comes from using incorrect objects to align to the horizon
- the Leans - feels like the craft is in a bank but is in level flight
- Autokinesis - a point in a dark and featureless background starts to move, comes from staring at it too long
- Graveyard spiral - not noticing a bank and atittude change, pulling up can cause a spiral
- Somatogravic - the nose feels like it's moving up or down, caused by rapid acceleration/deceleration
