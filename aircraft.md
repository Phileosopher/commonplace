# How to operate an aircraft

Unlike the comparatively simpler task of operating an [automotive](autos.md), aircraft represent risks in more directions:

- With the exception of a glider, there is a very real chance of stalling and freefalling to the ground as soon as the [engine](engineering-engines.md) fails.
- Birds can damage the aircraft if you're not observing where you're going.
- Other aircraft represent collision hazards, which is why every aircraft and their flight path must be registered with the government, as well as comply with [communications](engineering-radio.md) standards.
- Mid-air collision is magnified by visibility and navigation factors from [weather](science-weather.md) (e.g., hail, fog, wind).

To that end, most people should never fly.

- It requires constant alertness and conformity to procedure.
- Further, it requires a proper education in operating an aircraft.
