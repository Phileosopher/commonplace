# Commonplace

A repository of my public [commonplacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). It is a repo of my gathered notes along with supporting documentation for the following essays:

- [adequate.life](https://adequate.life/)
- [gainedin.site](https://gainedin.site/)
- [theologos.site](https://theologos.site/)
- [trendless.tech](https://trendless.tech/)

The following schema applies:

- (file_name).md: A "final" source of information
- (file_name).(image_extension): a "final" image that I can't distill to language
- (file_name)_.md: An old essay that hasn't been migrated yet
- (file_name)--.md: stray notes I found somewhere
- (file_name)--.(image_extension): a scraped image I found somewhere, recurses with additional dashes as needed
