# Commonplace

A repository of my public commonplacing. It is a repo of supporting documentation for the following:

- Adequate Data from [adequate.life](https://adequate.life/)
- Philosodata from [gainedin.site](https://gainedin.site/)
- Dumb Data from [notageni.us](https://notageni.us/)
- Spiritual Data from [theologos.site](https://theologos.site/)
- Tech Esoterica from [trendless.tech](https://trendless.tech/)

It has emerged once I realized my original vision for my websites have been misguided, egregiously so with the new trend of the arcanely verbose plagiarism generator we call "[machine learning](ai-machinelearning.md)".

So far, my first task is to simply migrate everything off those websites. That way, I can keep the commonplacing around while freeing up the websites for something more meaningful.
