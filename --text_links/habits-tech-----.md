(2018) Egoless Programming
> Egoless programming is a concept introduced by Gerald Weinberg in The Psychology Of Computer Programming. The idea is that programmers must fight the natural tendency to treat their programs as part of themselves, and therefore to reject all criticism. Rather, they should do their best to treat their designs & implementations as objects independent of themselves, and to view criticism dispassionately on its merits.

> every time you pick up a new Jira ticket or sit down to complete a new requirement, I suggest that you ask yourself the following questions: 
> * Who does this solve a problem for? 
> * What is the problem they’re trying to solve? 
> * How does this ticket solve it?
