## Ally message

Tips to protect yourself:

- Deny requests for a password. We'll never call you and ask for your Ally account password to verify your account. These scammers will.
- Ask questions. Asking questions like "When's the last time I called you?" may prompt the fraudster to hang up.
- Call us directly and [report fraud](https://click.alerts.ally.com/?qs=5af77452725c4636ed5637135eac1d6f130c488e054159f0689ec0c6573b837b1e6d26b2478ced8907c8136ec8a422dfc0e711f26d2745dc). If someone calls you for this information, hang up and call us at [1-833-226-1520](tel:1-833-226-1520) to report it.
- Stay aware. Fraudsters are constantly changing the ways they try to cheat you out of your money. Learn how to protect yourself against the latest [smishing and social media scams](https://click.alerts.ally.com/?qs=6c03eeac23189158b47e2ae67e25df5fb5a85d80a99b5c25b4f45d5350b97b903062f350307ab821879c8144b964fd25233847cedf175a51).
