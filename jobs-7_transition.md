# How to transition jobs

Only quit your current job after you know what day you're starting your new one, since *any* income is better than [unemployed](hardship-unemployment.md)!

If the job was at least decent, give at least two weeks' notice to leave:

- As soon as you put in your notice, expect the mood in the workplace to shift.
- If you were mistreated or abused, you're making a public statement and burning bridges by quitting without notice and are likely.

Write a formal resignation letter:

- Make it gracious and concise.
- Don't make promises, give too much information or mention your new workplace (which can *all* create [legal risks](legal-safety.md).
- Avoid phrasing anything negatively.
  - Vaguely say why you're leaving.
  - Share your gratitude and thankfulness for the new job opportunity.
- Turn your resignation letter into HR, your manager, or both.

Create a 1-2 minute "I am leaving" speech:

- Even if it's difficult, find *something* good to say about the company.
  - That company took a risk by giving you a job, a paycheck, and work experience.
- You can permanently ruin your reputation by [lying](people-lying.md), so be honest.
- Instead of vagueness about the role, clear state that you were only looking at one job or area.
- Genuinely thank each of your coworkers who helped you land the new job.
- Avoid negativity or boasting, and give more credit to your coworkers than yourself.

If you don't want a "going away" party, clearly tell your coworkers and manager up-front:

- If you do attend one, [stay gracious](people-3_respect.md) and be prepared to say some polite and broadly expressed words.
- If the event is outside work hours, restrain your [drinking](fun-alcohol.md) to avoid saying something offensive or for them to remember you as an alcoholic.

Your employer might present a counter-offer:

- Plan ahead on how to respond.
- Taking a counter-offer is usually inappropriate, so remember why you're leaving and what you're giving up.

To ease the blow from letting down your co-workers and manager, give a reference for a replacement.

To help them succeed, advise whoever takes over your work:

- Write a letter outlining suggestions and give it to your manager or a trusted co-worker.
- Note any critical details that you experienced the wrong way.

## Finish strong and leave graciously

Even if it's inconvenient, do the right thing to ensure a great reference and reputation.

Let any relevant clients know you're leaving.

Finish the work you were assigned:

- Once you've given notice, your manager will usually work you harshly or not give you any more work.
- Work hard all the way to the last day.
- Even if it's tempting, avoid any embarrassing or unscrupulous last days at your job.

Stay ethical and civil:

- Don't steal company property, including office supplies.
- Don't escalate any awkward situations.
- Don't make any last-minute company credit card expenses.
- Avoid any last-minute romances or public breakups during your transition.
- Delete any corporate passwords to avoid the temptation to use them.

Delete any personal files stored on the company computer.

Track any payments you're entitled to receive:

- Continuing [health benefits](insurance.md)
- 401(k) and other [retirement plans](money-investing.md)
- Accrued vacation and sick pay
- Bonus money or owed overtime pay
- Unreimbursed expenses

Turn in any company-owned property:

- Keys
- Computers, phones, electronics
- Product samples
- Tools
- ID badges
- Credit cards

Make decisions on workspace items you're taking:

- Take any evidence of your work you're permitted to take.
- Ask if you're uncertain on what you can take or leave.
  - Books
  - Whitepapers
  - Research reports
  - Awards
  - Personal items
- To avoid arousing suspicion, either pack them up after-hours or have someone else take them out for you.

Schedule a final debrief meeting with your manager to tie up loose ends:

- If you're uncertain, ask which trade secrets you're allowed to share.
- While it may not be possible in most situations, one of the more [rewarding experiences](mind-feelings-happiness-perma.md) in life is to leave a job on good terms.

Watch out for exit interviews:

- Be very, very careful about what you say.
  - If you speak vaguely or positively about why you left, you have nothing to lose.
  - By speaking out directly against the organization, the management may hate you and you could potentially get into [legal trouble](legal-safety.md).
- Of course, if you believe what you say will create change, and you already have a well-established [reputation](image.md) elsewhere, be as blunt as you want and don't expect anyone to care or change.
- The most useful thing to do with your experience is to clearly know what to *not* do in your own life and decisions in the future.
- Know beforehand what you want to say and how much information you want to share.

Old workplace contacts don't usually help later in your career, so cut connections with them unless you have other personal matters.

## Respect your old workplace

Even when it's tempting, don't talk badly about your old job.

If you feel unhappy with what happened, you can often state the concept in a roundabout way that politely delivers your point:

- "My manager was relatively new at his role, so it was hard for me to understand what he was aiming at."
- "The coworkers and I had uniquely different cultures, and the management favored them."
- "The environment wasn't conducive for the scale of career growth I was hoping for."
- "The company's culture wasn't tailored for the industry it was in."

Don't share your former company's secrets with your new job.

Create a "Who am I?" 1-2 minute speech for your new job:

- That speech will set the pace for your new workplace.
- Speak well of your last job.

## Make your new job better than your last

Analyze your failures as you start your new job:

- Look at what you did and didn't do correctly at your old job.
- Set goals to avoid those pitfalls in your new job.
- Consider what you liked and disliked at your old job and how you'll make it better this time.

Take full advantage of your new job's benefits and perks, which requires you to ask questions:

- What are all the company's reimbursed benefits?
- Is there a flex schedule/four-day workweek/work-from-home arrangement?
- Is there any paid time off for special circumstances (e.g., [maternity/paternity](parenting-1_babies.md) leave)?

During the workday, network with your *all* your new coworkers:

- Try to connect with the people beyond your current department or division.
- The secretaries, custodians, and tech support have most of the legitimate power in any workplace.
- Employers share wage information *constantly* with each other, so feel free to talk about your pay with your coworkers when your boss isn't around.

Take your new job *very* seriously:

- A new job is one of the most significant places where you can [succeed](success-1_why.md).
- [Listen carefully](language-speaking.md), [work hard](success-4_routine.md), [stay organized](organization.md), and [keep your workspace clean](home-housekeeping.md).

Stay mindful of your rights and responsibilities:

- You have the right to promptly receive wages promised by your employer, but also have a duty to do your best.
- You have the right to find a better job with better wages, but are also responsible to follow instructions.
- You have the right to speak up in the workplace, especially if you feel something is immoral, but are responsible to be [courteous about it](people-4_friends.md).
- You have the right to form employee groups (e.g., unions), but must respect your employer's property.
- You have the right to decide what goes into your own body (e.g., vaccines).

Build a relationship with your manager:

- Try to over-deliver what you promise.
- Consistently ask feedback on how you can improve.
- Thank your boss for what they do.
- Anticipate their needs and work on what they didn't ask you to do.

Understand the company's values and priorities:

- Work like you own the company and treat yourself as part-owner.
- Focus extra effort on high-value work, especially when the company values it.
- Observe whom the company promotes or rewards to discover the company's values.

Keep working outside your job for the long-term:

- Keep building on your more productive hobbies and interests, since they may become a career someday.
- Log your achievements on job social media like [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) or a portfolio website.
- Keep developing your soft skills (e.g., teamwork, [speaking](language-speaking.md), [negotiating](people-5_conflicts.md)).
- Make connections outside your current job for future work and opportunities.

Have an estimated period when you'll leave *that* job to take a promotion or another role:

- Document your meetings and [organize](organization.md) your knowledge so other people can review them and pick up where you left off.
- Unless you're having important role-specific meetings with your manager, include other people in events.
- Train people around you as you learn things, and identify someone who would make a good replacement for you.
- Essentially, try to [delegate as much as possible](mgmt-2_projects.md) to others who want to take the responsibility.

## You might discover your new job is terrible

Many people believe false promises, especially when they begin their career:

- [Go back to the job hunt immediately](jobs-2_goals.md) if your situation is particularly bad.
- Getting fired is worse than working only 6 months on your work history.
- [HR](business.md) is [legal protection](legal-safety.md) for the *company*, not for you.

If you're in consecutive terrible jobs, *you* might be the problem:

- If you've quickly transitioned between at least two jobs, consider professional career counseling or psychotherapy.
- Look at what's stopping your [success](success-1_why.md).

If you're frustrated and bold enough, stop trying to work as an employee and [run your own company](entrepreneur-1_why.md).
