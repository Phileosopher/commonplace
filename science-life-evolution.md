# Evolution explained

While the domains extrapolating across millions of years of life are simply unprovable in any scientific sense, natural selection is a known reality.

The process of natural selection is simple enough to understand:

1. A population will reproduce with offspring.
2. Each of the offspring has variations from its ancestor (e.g., eye color, hair color, etc.)
3. The traits will be most favorable for offspring that fulfill the following conditions:
   1. They survive long enough to reproduce.
   2. *Their* offspring are viable enough to reproduce.

This explains many things, such as skin color, speciation, and even aspects of [culture](people-culture.md).

However, there are some unspoken implications of natural selection.

- The entire mechanism is built upon [death](hardship-death.md), since the absence of death would mean there'd be no "selection", and it would simply be reproduction in proportion to fertility and availability.
- The environment itself changes due to natural selection in unforeseeable ways, so it is absolutely impossible to [predict](imagination.md) what can happen from it.

## Culture destroyer

In a human sense, evolution is a cultural destroyer:

1. Viable and strong people make a prosperous society.
2. That society fills itself with [professional victims](https://gainedin.site/victim/), [technical idiots](https://gainedin.site/idiot/), and other less-than-viable people.
3. The culture eventually develops enough [healthcare](body-health.md) that even insufficient stock is able to reproduce.
4. Eventually, the collective health of that society collapses under its own enablement of unhealthy individuals.

The only way to offset this is through legitimate [religion](religion.md) oriented towards the preservation of life.

- [Fascism](politics-systems.md) arose due to the invalidation of life due to [postmodern thinking](philosophy.md) oriented without restraint toward this reasoning.
