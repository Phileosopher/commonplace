# General education requirements for American children

Every state and precinct has unique requirements, which [you should be informed of](legal-safety.md).

- Each state has its own legal framework that allows homeschooling.
- If you move to another state, don't presume the prior state's rules apply.
- Research *precisely* by grade what you must teach your children.
- Keep records of the work your children perform, as well as any tests you've given them and how well they've done.
- Preferably, document the experience right after it happened, since you may not remember 4--6 months ago.
- Stay connected with a homeschool community, who will keep you informed about any changes to reporting requirements and standards.
- With the freedoms you'll likely give your children, keep an eye out for "Reasonable Childhood Independence" laws and where your state stands.
  - In places that don't have those laws, a terrified person calling the police could send you into a legal battle because you sent your 7-year-old a quarter-mile down the road to get some groceries.

Some states require tests and others don't regulate it at all.

- If you're doing a good-enough job, the children will be fine: the requirements are minimums for when a child sits neglected in a boring room for 5--6 hours a day.
- The larger risk is in *proving* they've fulfilled the criteria, not necessarily *doing* it, especially with more open-ended curricula.
- Most lesson-planning and advanced prep isn't necessary until around junior high and high school.

It's worth noting that these are all *approximate*. Your [culture](people-culture.md) will emphasize some and de-emphasize others, and the requirements are assigned by your region's culture.

## Pre-K

Since you're trying to raise your children instead of [acculturate](people-culture.md) them to a [learning-restrictive](education.md) classroom environment, keep working on [qualities that make moral, hard-working children](parenting-children.md).

You can teach small children as young as 3 years old to read:

1. Teach the most common phoneme (how it sounds) for each letter.
2. Teach them to blend those phonemes into simple words by saying the word fast.
3. Teach them to parse harder words: secondary phonemes, digigraphs (multiple letters making 1 sound), and silent "e" indicating a long vowel sound.
4. Intentionally practice 30--60 minutes a day through a text, *without* pre-reading skills and drilling specific words.

However, Pre-K children who learn to read will probably not retain most of their learning, so only teach it as far as they would like to explore it.

## Kindergarten

Most kindergarten schooling is simply creating the "standards" that will later become more in-depth studying. In many ways, kindergarten is more important for *you* as a parent to start the [habit](habits.md) of educating than for them to actually "learn" anything.

## High School

Generally, high school homeschoolers will diverge based on the situation.

There are *many* specializations in high school, but there's a wide range of educational requirements based on region, and an even *wider* range of the available options for the student.

- Most of the time, there are a wide variety of applied courses, including [auto repair](autos.md), [home economics](home-housekeeping.md), [cooking](cooking.md), or [communications](people-3_respect.md).
- Literacy can range from simply revisiting 8th Grade up to working with collegiate-level literature (e.g., British Literature).
- Math can range from a slightly more advanced algebra, all the way into trigonometry, statistics, and [calculus](math-calc.md).
- Science starts focusing on more specific domains like biology, chemistry, and physics.
- Humanities typically involves *much* more political discussion, as well as [economic theory](economics.md) and more details on how governments work.
- Arts branch out into a vast set of specializations which may include painting, visual arts, woodworking, or performance arts.

Depending on the situation, older students can try going to school online (e.g., [Khan World School](https://asuprep.asu.edu/khan-world-school/)). If they're self-determining and their lifestyle can still be balanced outside a classroom, it's worth considering.

## Graduating

They have several ways to graduate high school:

1. The culturally standardized route is to sit in high school classrooms, pass the classes, and pass the exit exam.
   - If you even marginally succeeded, they'll pass the exit exam before even starting the classroom sessions (it often requires an 8th-grade reading/math level).
2. Find a work-at-your-own-pace high school online, then pass the credits more quickly, without the social experience.
3. Get an unconventional certification (e.g., [GED](https://ged.com/)) or a diploma through a homeschool group.
   - They can convert a GED to a diploma later via college.
   - The homeschool group diploma won't have as much influence as a GED.
   - Either way, they can completely resolve any discrepancy with social status if they get an associate's degree from a community college (which is usually worth the time and money).

You won't really know the best approach until at least 8th Grade, since it all depends on them.

- A particularly intelligent can typically pass the high school exit exam by the time they're in 8th Grade.
- They may *really* want to explore high school for the social experience (e.g., prom, athletics).
- If they're not particularly focused on anything (which is typical), they should start considering their [career](jobs-1_why.md) and find classes that feed into their preferred specialization.
- Generally, [colleges](jobs-college.md) will care about a *diploma* (rather than a GED), but don't care that it was completed early.
- If they already know what they want or the home has started growing dysfunctional from their adolescence, send them somewhere else to complete their education (e.g., prep school, military school).

Many [colleges](jobs-college.md) don't necessarily look at early graduation as a positive thing.

- Instead, if they want college, they should use that extra time to accrue extra college credit via dual enrollment.
- While their academic achievement may matter, they should *also* spend time on personal development (e.g., [making friends](people-friends.md), [pursuing hobbies](fun.md)).

Their [coming of age](parenting-3_teenagers.md) involves several possible scenarios:

1. They move out to [explore their career](jobs-1_why.md) with what you've given them.
2. They adopt [something related](jobs-specialization.md) to *your* career.
3. If they don't like either of those two options, they'll have to find their path (which guarantees moving out if you [live somewhat remotely](home-homestead.md)).
4. If you can afford it, [send them](parenting-3_teenagers.md) on a journey:
   - Send them to [college](jobs-college.md).
   - Give them a few thousand dollars and a one-way ticket to somewhere they want to travel (e.g., Europe).
