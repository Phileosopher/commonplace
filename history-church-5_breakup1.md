# The summarized history of the Christian church 5: Breakup #1 - Different Catholic Churches

The issues with deposing Photius were among a vast range of [cultural](people-culture.md) differences between the East and West Catholic Church. The region we know as Russia had just come under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church ~950 AD, and they weren't too happy with some ways the centralized authority went back to Rome.

This all came to a conflict in 1054, where the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke apart in the Great Schism.

From the outside, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox are mostly the same, though the Orthodox priesthood tends to grow grandiose beards. Eastern Orthodox had some smaller adaptations to Ecumenical Council #6, and there was also a tremendous amount of contention over the filioque, which essentially argues over 3 words in [the Nicene Creed](church-creeds.md), and there were quite a few [political battles](people-conflicts-war.md) regarding the precise authority over the Pope.

**Eastern Orthodox** ended up freezing their cultural values around the year 800 AD or so, and hasn't changed much with Roman Catholic [trends](trends.md) since then.
