# How to have contracts with others

Always, *always* use [a contract](people-contracts.md), written at least, and preferably notarized.

- Even if it's a quick task or a project for a friend, a contract protects all parties.
- While it may seem obsessive or distrustful, you're protecting yourself against the worst parts of a dramatic minority of acquaintances and interactions (similar to [security cameras](safety-security.md)).

Always send a proposal in writing that outlines the scope of the project:

1. What you will do.
2. Any clear deadlines about when you'll do it.
3. Any clear things you will *not* do.
4. The rate you'll charge for any tasks outside the scope of what you're contracted to do.
5. A formalized contract they're required to sign.

If you expect continued business, send a master services agreement, along with a new scope of work for each new project.

- Keep track of anything relevant to the engagement, both in [paperwork](legal-safety.md) and in [accounting](accounting.md).

Whatever price that's been agreed-upon is non-negotiable.

- Do research beforehand about how much others charge for the service you're providing.
- When proposing your rate for a service, either increase your rate for a service with the expectation they'll push back, or make the rate reasonable and non-negotiable.

When you get a middle party, pay *very* close attention to what you are gaining from their existence.

- Many people find ways to get in the middle of things where they're not necessary.
- In the case of many long-term arrangements, they'll treat you very well on the first engagement, then ignore your needs on subsequent interactions.

When an agreement has adverse consequences for termination, watch for people performing strange behavior with it.

- They may try tempting you to breach the contract, then [lie](people-lying.md) that they didn't know it was a breach but need to enforce it.
- If the person who cancels the contract must pay, then they may try to get *you* to terminate the engagement.

Since anything can exist as a contract, many scams are also viable contracts.

Many contract provisions may be a violation of [civil rights](people-boundaries.md):

- Punitive non-compete agreements
- No-criticism agreements
- Usage of personal [intellectual property](legal-ip.md)

Stay on top of *any* changes to the contract.

- The provider may force binding arbitration.
- There may be new opt-out windows for added components or cancellation of a service.

The large print hides what the small print can take away.
