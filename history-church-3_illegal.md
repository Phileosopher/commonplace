# The summarized history of the Christian church 3: An Illegal Religion

Naturally, some believers were more [educated](education.md) or gifted than others, but the bar to join was relatively low. If you observe the [elders/deacons requirements](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1TI.5.WEB), anyone who is keeping themselves relatively pure morally would qualify to become a [leader](mgmt-church.md). The entire message of Christ, mixed with its culture, *heavily* attracted the poor, slaves, and women.

Politically, Rome didn't know what to do with them. They stubbornly honored their beliefs in God (which defied the [Roman pantheon](religion.md)), but they were *excellent* Roman citizens. Their general approach was to leave them alone, but heavily persecute them for *any* law they may potentially have broken.

In 62 AD, Rome had a massive fire, potentially set by the Roman emperor Nero, who blamed Christians for the fire. This forced *heavy* persecution on the Christians, and their response created *massive* influence as they were scattered across the Roman Empire.

The Christian Church was *not* popular with Rome, and had been at least partly attributed to why Rome had fallen as an empire. This became *especially* toxic for Christians between the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 and the rise of Diocletian in 284.

Philip the Arab was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 244 to 249. He was implied to be Christian, but was still Pontifex Maximus (i.e., a god who had the right to go to any temple). It is very likely the attribution of Communion/Eucharist being dangerous to the soul was directly tied to his attempt to enter a Christian Service of Thanksgiving.

The first incident of widespread, direct Christian-targeted persecution came through Decius in 250, though he spared Jews from it because he considered their religion to be more legitimate because it was older.

It's worth noting that the [sinfulness](morality-sins.md) of the Church was also present. Christian culture had adopted the practice of using girls for sexual activities, as well as a legitimate abortion issue.
