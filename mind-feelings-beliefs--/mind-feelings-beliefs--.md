## foreign words


Litost (Czech) - a state of torment created by the sudden sight of one’s own misery

Saudade (Portuguese) - A somewhat melancholic feeling of incompleteness; longing for something that might never return

Ti voglio bene (Italian) - The attachment for family, friends and pets

Hiraeth (Welsh) - A homesickness for a home to which you cannot return, or a home which maybe never was

Gezelligheid (Dutch) - The comfort and cosiness of being at home with friends and family, or general togetherness

L’esprit de l’escalier (French) - Usually translated as “staircase wit”, thinking of a clever comeback when it is too late to deliver it

Gigil (Filipino) - The urge to pinch or squeeze something that is unbearably cute


Ei viitsi (Estonian) - A feeling of slight laziness, and not being bothered to do anything

Waldeinsamkeit (German) - The feeling of being alone in the woods

Sgriob (Gaelic) - The itchiness that overcomes the upper lip just before taking a sip of whisky

Desbundar (Portuguese) - to shed one’s inhibitions in having fun

Shinrin-yoku (Japanese) - the relaxation gained from bathing in the forest, figuratively or literally

Gigil (Tagalog) - the irresistible urge to pinch or squeeze someone because they are loved or cherished

Yuan bei (Chinese) - a sense of complete and perfect accomplishment

Iktsuarpok (Inuit) - the anticipation one feels when waiting for someone, whereby one keeps going outside to check if they have arrived

Wabi-sabi (Japanese) – a “dark, desolate sublimity” centred on transience and imperfection in beauty

Saudade (Portuguese) – a melancholic longing or nostalgia for a person, place or thing that is far away either spatially or in time – a vague, dreaming wistfulness for phenomena that may not even exist

Sehnsucht (German) – “life-longings”, an intense desire for alternative states and realisations of life, even if they are unattainable

Dadirri (Australian aboriginal) term – a deep, spiritual act of reflective and respectful listening

Pihentagyú (Hungarian) – literally meaning “with a relaxed brain”, it describes quick-witted people who can come up with sophisticated jokes or solutions

Desenrascanço (Portuguese) – to artfully disentangle oneself from a troublesome situation

Orenda (Huron) – the power of the human will to change the world in the face of powerful forces such as fate

Viraag // Hindi

- Quarantine and social distancing are causing a lot of viraag, or the inner turmoil and pain we experience when we’re separated—not just metaphorically but also literally—from the ones we love.

Cwtch // Welsh

- With physical contact severely restricted, most of us will connect immediately with this Welsh word that means to embrace another person to give them a sense of safety. Basically, what everyone could use right about now.

Sielvartas // Lithuanian

- The literal translation of this Lithuanian word is “soul tumbling,” which itself is actually a pretty poetic, and accurate, way to describe the seemingly endless emotional tumult that is grief.

Fernweh // German

- When your circuit is the same almost every day—workplace or home office, supermarket, drugstore, bed—fernweh, the hunger to travel to faraway destinations, can be overwhelmingly strong.

Goesting // Dutch

- Yes, Can’t Hardly Wait is the title of a generic ’90s teen rom-com, but it’s also perhaps the closest translation in English for this Dutch word that sums up how we’re all feeling about the end of the pandemic.

Friluftsliv // Norwegian

- The literal translation of this Norwegian word, often attributed to playwright Henrik Ibsen, is “free air life,” or the appreciation of the restorative power of being outdoors and engaged with nature. The pandemic has curtailed most outdoor activities that involve close proximity with others, but solo or socially distanced pursuits—hiking, biking, walking, or just sitting quietly—offer the relaxation and reinvigoration most of us need.

Volta // Greek

- The Greek concept of volta—an early-evening communal stroll around town—is not only an excellent post-meal digestion aid but also an opportunity to get out of the house and get your body moving, in a leisurely, no-need-to-sweat manner.

Boketto (ぼけっと)// Japanese

- Working from home, eating at home, trying to relax at home—home is where a lot of us have been spending our waking, and sleeping, hours for the past seven months. That time has provided ample occasion to perfect the Japanese art of boketto, or staring blankly into space.

Donaldkacsázás // Hungarian

- When you’re confined to the house, what’s the point of dressing up … or even getting fully dressed, for that matter? Maybe it’s time to follow Donald Duck’s lead and Donaldkacsázás—slang for “Donald ducking,” a.k.a. meandering around your home wearing a shirt but no pants. Just don’t forget to remain seated during that Zoom conference call.

Waltersobchakeit // German
- When someone else is correct, but they are being a pretentious jerk

Exulansis - the tendency to give up trying to talk about an experience because people are unable to relate to it

Jouska - a hypothetical conversation that you compulsively play out in your head

Lachesism - the desire to be struck by disaster: to survive a plane crash, or to lose everything in a fire

Liberosis - the desire to care less about things

Mauerbauertraurigkeit - the inexplicable urge to push people away, even close friends who you really like

Opia - the ambiguous intensity of looking someone in the eye, which can feel simultaneously invasive and vulnerable

Rubatosis - the unsettling awareness of your own heartbeat

Vellichor - the strange wistfulness of used bookshops
