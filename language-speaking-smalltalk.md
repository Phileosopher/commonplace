# How to make small talk

Small talk is the most frequent, necessary communication skill, even though quite a few people [are disposed to](personality.md) always hate small talk:

- Detail-oriented people often want to discuss more in-depth about their interests.
- Intelligent people often want to discuss more profound or meaningful subjects.
- Introverts may be more accustomed to silence than most people.
- Ambitious people don't like it because it doesn't get to the point.
- Emotionally secure people tend to hate circumventing topics.
- Introverts don't like it because it pads out the time spent in a public setting with others.
- Socially awkward people tend to face rejection and have [past trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) from small talk.
- Highly successful people in non-social disciplines hate small talk because it circumvents legitimate [conflicts](people-conflicts.md).

While small talk is shallow, it's critical:

- Small talk lets people "test" others in a safe environment that doesn't offend or cross boundaries.
- People are uncomfortable with silence, and small talk is mindless information that easily fills it.
- Everyone can learn about others without having to trust people with personal information.
- People who professionally use small talk will match the tone and style of behavior they're reading from others.
- Some of the most common "small talk only" zones are while eating, [parties](fun-parties.md), and most public events.
- At the same time, the "big talk" often comes out during dessert or when the check comes, in a side discussion at a party, or after most people have left the event.

Successful small talk can filter out the worst of humanity:

- Someone sharing harsh convictions, dogmatic behavior or extreme negativity in public will be more difficult in private.
- Gossips will talk poorly about other people *before* they learn anything about you.
- Someone who complains and blames isn't trustworthy with responsibilities.
- A person's exaggerations show they're unaware how their words make others feel.

## Unacceptable topics

Some subjects are never, *ever* small talk:

- Intimate relationships and sex
- Death, morbidity, and significant medical problems
- Personal gain that outpaces anyone else's
- Business opportunities, especially sales or small business affairs, including [MLM](marketing-mlm.md)
- Secrets, especially about others who aren't in the conversation
- Negative remarks about anything, especially about others

Depending on culture, other topics may be off-limits for small talk:

- Age and weight
- Ethnic origin
- Family or marital status
- Salary, income, financial information or money/career problems
- Politics and controversial social issues
  - Sometimes you can't criticize what others openly condemn (such as race or financial status)
- Religious views or philosophy
- The [economy](economics.md), the stock market or current events
- Anything that can offend someone's nationality or criticize royalty
- Any compliments that may look like [flirting](relationships-dating.md)
- Intimate details about love life or sex life
- Alcohol or drug consumption
- Inappropriate humor (which is *highly* contextual) or no sense of humor
- Obesity, which varies from a sign of health to a public shame
- Culture-contextual, it might be rude to share or *not* share personal details

## Acceptable topics

Introduce yourself and ask about them.

Ask about their day or week.

Introduce someone you know to a new person:

- Don't introduce someone you've just met unless your introduction can legitimately benefit them.

Give a compliment:

- Everyone loves legitimate, specific compliments so much that they associate positive feelings toward the people who give them, even when those compliments are *not*sincere!
- Every affirmation is a variation of a few statements:
  - I love/appreciate you.
  - I'm proud of you.
  - You are important.
  - You are special.
  - You have worth.
  - You are unique.
  - You look great.
  - What you're doing matters.
  - You've performed well.
- Try to insert compliments into the flow of the conversation as a presumed fact.
- Make your compliments incredibly specific.
- Give compliments as if you've heard them, not simply that you've observed something.
- Only compliment in a way that they can't misunderstand your statement as insensitive, discriminatory or flirtatious.
- Only use self-effacing compliments if the person you're talking to sees themselves as *lower* in social status than you.
- If someone accomplishes anything, immediately praise them.
- When you *receive* compliments, don't dwell on them and simply say "thank you, that's very kind of you."

Ask general topics:

- School or work
- Workplaces and places traveled
- [Career or job](jobs-1_why.md) aspirations
  - If that person is [unemployed](hardship-unemployment.md), don't ask how their job search is going unless they're starting a job soon.

Compare and contrast lifestyles:

- Hobbies and interests
- Family
- Friends and shared connections
- Cultural or political differences (if you're speaking without judgment)

Share small pieces of your personal life:

- Likes and dislikes
- Childhood aspirations
- Hometown
- Plans, hopes, and dreams
- Goals and accomplishments that are appropriate to the listener

Talk about things beyond the conversation:

- Current news stories, if they're not controversial
- Other people, as long as you keep it positive
- The current situation or venue
- Holidays in the near past or future
- Weather

Discuss entertainment:

- Music
- TV and movies
- Books and magazines
- Sports
- Fashion and trends
- Celebrities

Tell jokes or [funny anecdotes](humor.md).

## Build a sense of humor

[Humor](humor.md) is intimately connected to your ability to have [fun](fun.md).

If you have trouble finding humor, think of the opposites of what everyone expects, how people think or behave, or how anyone would typically react.

Do *not*, however, make a joke at someone else's expense:

- If your joke is even slightly offensive, [influential](power-influence.md) people may find a way to get revenge later.

Since most humor involves pain and some people have [unresolved trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) about certain subjects, be careful about [offending](hardship-ptsd.md) anyone listening.

If you're *not* funny, it's not as hard as it seems:

- Most professional comedians are only funny half the time.
- People remember a great joke far more than several bad ones.
- Most of the skill in delivering good humor comes in timing, which comes through practice with well-placed pacing and silence.
- To make a punchline work, don't laugh at it.

Allow a pause for laughter unless you're not expecting it or don't want silence to set in.

Make an inside joke with someone by recalling a silly part of the first time you met them.

If your joke misses, make a self-effacing joke about your bad joke.
