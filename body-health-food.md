# How to eat healthy

Always drink at least 1-2 liters of water every day, preferably filtered.

Modern manufacturers want foods and drinks to be more [addicting](addiction.md) (and thus, more [marketable](marketing.md)), so they'll increase the ratio of unhealthy-but-tasty things:

- Adding more sugar, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), or any other form of natural sweetener.
- Adding more salt.
- Removing dietary fiber.
- Adding oil or fat, especially saturated and trans fat.

To lower costs, lengthen shelf life, and [stay competitive](economics.md), many foods can remove or substitute healthy options for not-so-healthy ones:

- Adding preservatives and colorants that can cause liver damage (e.g., most canned foods contain at least some BPA).
- Adding allergens like soy-based derivatives (soy lecithin, soy protein isolate) or Red 40 colorant instead of something else.

Another cost-saving method is to pull off useful elements for *other* products or use leftovers to create entirely new products:

- Pulling fat out of dairy products (low-fat/non-fat/reduced fat) to use for products like butter.
- Ground-up foods (e.g., hamburger, peanut butter) are generally using the lowest-quality "meat" possible (e.g., organ meat, nostrils) since nobody really knows otherwise.
- [Tea](fun-tea.md) bags are the remaining parts of tea leaves (and stems, and branches sometimes) that didn't go to the leaf-based product.
- Taking out bones from meat (which normally makes a healthy bone broth) to go to pet food companies.

## The diet/health industry has advertised *many* myths

The modern approach to [diet](body-diet.md) and [exercise](body-exercise.md) complicates an otherwise straightforward topic to [sell things you don't need](art.mdmarketing).

Fat is a necessary, healthy part of the body.

- Too many carbs or protein will make someone fat more than *eating* fat, typically because fat satisfies us more.
- Animal fats are healthier than processed vegetable oils, mostly because foods like butter and meat have many rare nutrients that are difficult to substitute.
- Eggs (including yolks) have been scientifically proven to have many health benefits.
- There is no direct link between cholesterol and heart disease.

The body needs more proteins and fats than carbohydrates.

- Generally, people crave a variation of what their body needs (which is rarely bread or candy).
- Carbohydrates are our body's energy, but are unhealthy when they spike blood sugar levels.
- Generally, food with a high glycemic index is full of quickly digested simple sugars.
- Empty carbs (e.g., candy) are the easiest food and snacks to grab, which is why you'll need a *ton* of impulse control to survive it.
  - Further, modern society *bombards* you with [advertisements](marketing.md) to erode your willpower.
  - Even when you've turned down fast food, candy, and a can of soda, you might relent near the end of the day with a bag of chips.
- A body that works with too many carbs for long enough will suffer an insulin production disease (i.e., diabetes), though it can often be offset by [exercise](body-exercise.md).
  - A growing body of scientific data has demonstrated that the largest contributor to most sugar-based afflictions comes through the body's over-production of insulin, which means the body creates a type of insulin resistance over time.
- The most significant measure for healthy carbohydrate intake is glycemic load (GL), which is a relatively simple calculation:
   1. Measure the food's glycemic index (GI), which is the food's carbohydrate density.
      - Low GI is 55 or less, and high GI is 70 or higher.
   2. Multiply the GI by the grams of carbohydrate in the food you're consuming, then divide by 100.
   3. The result will be the GL:
      - Low GL is 10 or less, high GL is 20 or higher.

Healthy dieting is about balanced nutrition more than consuming anything specific.

- There's no cure-all food that will resolve many problems, though the [placebo effect](mind-bias.md) works well for those people.
- A full diet requires variety to provide trace amounts of various fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.
  - Fruits and vegetables should "fill in" the bulk of what we eat to give us enough dietary fiber and hydration.
- A steady routine of consuming in moderation is more effective than following rules or eating specific foods.
  - Artificial food products (e.g., Soylent, shake diets) won't account for the body's need for trace nutrients.

Health [trends](trends.md) mean something is often marketed as "healthy", but where the vendor added something else:

- Low-fat usually means the vendor added sugar to compensate for the unfulfilling feeling.
- "Diet" and low-carb foods usually add artificial sweeteners that taste (mostly) like sugar but are indigestible, so the body produces an excess of insulin to break the artificial sweeteners down.
- Gluten-free food only benefits people with celiac disease, and usually uses higher-sugar flours to compensate for the lousy consistency.

One solution won't work for everyone, since it varies heavily on lifestyle and body type.

- The popular diet standard of 2,000 calories a day depends heavily on *what* that person is consuming.
- Further, over years, [different cultures](people-culture.md) can often adjust to high or low quantities of certain food types.

Self-disciplining ourselves with food and feeling well *requires* including consistent exercise.

While the fluoride in toothpaste *can* help with healthy teeth, living in a major metropolitan area that fluoridates the water means you do *not* need toothpaste when you brush.

- In large quantities, too much fluoride is dangerous.
- Any abrasives in toothpaste aren't nearly as effective as directly using baking soda.
- The best improvement to dental hygiene is to get a mechanical toothbrush.
- With any dental issues, worry more about sugar intake than frequent brushing.

The Standard American Diet (SAD) is *filled* with risks, on several levels:

1. Too many additives and preservatives, which often demonstrates in products that can last on a shelf for over two years without spoiling whatsoever.
2. Enormous portions, which guarantee obesity simply from raw calorie count irrespective of the food itself.
3. Too many carbohydrates in the food, irrespective of being simple or complex, or whether there's enough fiber in it.

While [Big Medi/Pharma](https://gainedin.site/here-2/) may prolong your life, they would prefer your dependence on them.

- One of the [cultural](people-culture.md) results of the industry is excessive over-diagnosis that creates unnecessary health scares:
  - Chickenpox is typical in children, and doesn't typically pose any legitimate health risks.
  - Pink eye is irritating and highly infectious, but doesn't typically pose any legitimate health risks.
  - After the first wave of COVID-19, herd immunity has meant that it doesn't typically pose any legitimate health risks.
  - However, the culture often obsesses about the <1% likely event that *could* pose a health risk.
  - The culture can also be magnified in unhealthy ways if the focus shifts more toward [transhumanism](computers-biological.md) than [fixing things](https://adequate.life/fix/) to preserve the quality of life.
- The ideal arrangement is to rely on them as little as possible, for as long as possible.
- However, as you [age](maturity.md), you will likely depend on them more, and that dependence may save your life.

## The right food to eat

[Lose weight](body-diet.md), since any gains from eating healthy things can't offset the risks of being morbidly obese.

Take controversial advice carefully, since those things *might* be bad for you, but you'll need to feel it out with your body:

- Soy-based products, though it's even more debatable on how and what form of refinement is acceptable.
- Whole-grains, though it's debatable which ones and how much.
- Egg yolks and red meat, especially beef.
- Dairy, especially refined dairy like cheese and butter.
- Fermentation is simply more microorganisms (which is how we get spoiled food), so not all fermented food is inherently healthy.

Generally, aim for enough nutrients:

- Vitamin A maintains eyesight.
- Vitamin B has many benefits.
  - Deficiency in Vitamin B6 can cause aggression.
- Vitamin C maintains the immune system.
- Vitamin D combines with calcium to rebuild bones.
- Vitamin E has antioxidant (general health) properties, and almost anything with antioxidants is healthy (though there's not much [science](science.md) around why).
- Electrolytes are salts that help muscles work better.
- Focus on eating and supplementing what your body *can't* synthesize itself:
  - Omega-3 fatty acids
  - Potassium (found heavily in bananas)
- If you have any concerns about not getting enough nutrients, take at *least* a daily multivitamin every once in a while.

Most food is only a *little* unhealthy:

- Eating a piece of cake doesn't kill you, but eating a piece of cake every day for 10,000 days might.

Avoid concentrated sugars, in everything.

- This is by far *the* hardest diet decision you can ever make in a civilized society with a [free market](economics.md) because they stick sweetener in *absolutely everything*!

Generally, avoid saturated fat (especially trans fat) and lean heavier into unsaturated fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated).

Try to improve your gut bacteria:

- There is at least some scientific correlation between gut microbiota and Alzheimer's disease.
- Alcohol ethoxylates in dishwasher detergent cause heavy damage to gut bacteria.
- Probiotic supplements and foods add to your microbiome with fermented cultures (though it'll cause discomfort at first):
  - Certain cheeses (e.g., raw cheese)
  - Fermented fish
  - Japanese natto
  - Kimchi
  - Sauerkraut
  - Sourdough bread
  - Sour pickles
  - Tempeh
  - Yogurt (e.g., kefir, coconut yogurt)
- Prebiotic supplements give more opportunity for healthy microbes to thrive:
  - Asparagus
  - Bananas
  - Cabbage
  - Cocoa
  - Flaxseeds
  - Garlic
  - Mushrooms
  - Onions

Avoid processed meats like ground hamburger, hot dogs, and sausage, since they're "miscellaneous" meat products and usually have added hormones, antibiotics, and veterinary drugs.

If a food product can keep for months, it's usually less healthy than an equivalent that will spoil within a few days or weeks.

In general, avoid modern synthetic food:

- Most government agencies simply give animals 1000x the designated dose of a potentially harmful chemical, then watch what happens, which means most *chronically* harmful chemicals are perfectly legal.
- Wheat with the germ removed (e.g., white bread) is mostly empty calories.
- Margarine and vegetable oils (including when used for fried foods) have *tons* of trans fat.
- Pre-made foods like microwave popcorn and prepackaged dinners have preservatives and additives.
- Caffeine (even in coffee and tea) can run the risk of low dopamine, which has some links to Parkinson's Disease.
- Avoid high-sugar drinks:
  - Fruit juice without the pulp has *much* more sugar and far less fiber than the fruits themselves.
  - Sports drinks are only good for athletes in the middle of a workout for quick energy, and only when diluted.
- Non-organic vegetables, especially potatoes and apples, often absorb pesticides into the food.
- Unfermented soy products have a host of risks.
- Most fast food adds much more salt, fat, and preservatives than store-bought alternatives, and they often deep-fry them.
  - In restaurants, be careful asking a waitress' recommended dish, since it's usually what the kitchen is trying to get rid of.

With vegetables and fruits, try to "eat the rainbow" to get all you need (red, yellow, blue, purpose, orange, green, etc.).

### Healthy food protects you

Drink more water and less flavored beverages (including [coffee](fun-coffee.md) and [tea](fun-tea.md)).

To avoid cravings as you go about your day, keep prepared food available to [recondition](habits.md) your bad habits (e.g., grilled chicken, nuts).

Any food with antioxidants can help your body heal.

- Apples
- Artichokes
- Avocadoes
- Beans
- Berries, especially blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, and strawberries
- Cherries
- Plums and prunes
- Potatoes

Tea and coffee has health benefits:

- Coffee aids digestion.
- [Drinking tea](fun-tea.md) has antioxidants that prevent stroke.
- Green tea has L-theanine and reduces the risk of cavities, strengthens bones, and strengthens the immune system.

Fruit is generally healthy:

- Fruits (especially citrus, melons, and kiwifruit) have Vitamin C that increases metabolism and strengthens the immune system.
- Avocados lower cholesterol.
- Berries, cherries, and plums are filled with antioxidants.
- Cranberry juice prevents bladder infections.
- Squirt some citrus juice into water to stay hydrated *and* enjoy a non-water drink.

Vegetables are rarely a bad decision:

- Vegetables, especially dark green and orange ones, have Vitamin E and decrease lung cancer.
- Vegetables like peppers, leafy vegetables, sprouts, broccoli, cabbage have tons of Vitamin C.
- Some vegetables like spinach, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and beets are high in antioxidants.
- Broccoli balances the blood sugar.
- Cabbage decreases the risk of breast cancer and ulcers.
- Onions lower blood pressure.

Don't neglect high-fat vegetables:

- Avocados are high in monounsaturated fats and Vitamin E.
- Olives and olive oil has polyunsaturated fats.

Consider certain herbs and seasonings:

- Apple cider vinegar strengthens the immune system.
- Cinnamon regulates blood sugar.
- Coconut oil reduces inflammation.
- Garlic lowers cholesterol.
- Ginger or ginger tea maintains digestive health.
- Habanero peppers improve blood flow.
- Horseradish root increases heart health.
- Oregano and olive oil lower blood pressure.
- Pepper reduces inflammation.
- Turmeric reduces inflammation.

Legumes can help regulate the body:

- Nuts have lots of Vitamin E.
- Nuts like almonds, cashews, and pistachios provide monounsaturated fats that help with brain and heart health.
  - Nut oils tend to still have monounsaturated fats (rapeseed/canola oil, peanut oil).
  - Macadamia oil is very healthy.
- Peanuts balance blood sugar, though peanut butter uses the lowest-quality nuts available.
- Unsalted sunflower seeds reduce cholesterol.
- Walnuts help boost testosterone.
- Chia seeds are particularly nutrient-rich.

Some meats are good for you:

- Salmon boosts testosterone and has polyunsaturated fats.

Dairy and eggs can be healthy:

- Milk products have plenty of calcium and Vitamin E.
- Egg yolks have lots of Vitamin E.
- Yogurt prevents yeast infection and has probiotics to improve digestive health.

Not all grains are unhealthy:

- Whole grains (with the germ included) increase testosterone output.
- Grains have Vitamin E, especially inside the germ.
- Pizza decreases the risk of esophageal cancer.
- Pinole grain (within the maize family) is particularly nutrient-rich.

Not all "natural" produce is healthy:

- Often, bugs and diseases can get into organic food *more* than food that was genetically modified or without pesticides.
- If you don't know where dried figs are sourced, watch for the carcinogen Aflatoxin B~1~, a dangerous carcinogen from fungi (you can check by seeing if they shine under ultraviolet light).

## Take supplements

Supplements aren't "natural", but neither are typical food products in a non-agrarian society, so it offsets the refined foods that come with civilization.

But, watch for *which* supplements you take:

- Most health supplements are completely unregulated cocktails of ingredients, so you can't always trust the honesty of what the label says.
- Weight-loss supplements promise unrealistic results, and many of them that *do* create results are terrible for the body.

Daily multivitamins are usually unnecessary.

- If over-consumed, vitamins can be dangerous.
- Most vitamins can't cure or help a cold, so any results are simply the [placebo effect](mind-bias.md).
- Some specific vitamins can help certain issues (e.g., Vitamin D if indoors all the time), but they should be on an as-needed basis.

Every time you eat something extremely sweet, consume fiber powder with it to prevent a "sugar crash".

Spirulina powder is high-protein, has many vitamins and minerals, has antioxidants, and improves blood flow.

A few supplements have many scientifically proven benefits:

- Omega-3 fatty acids (which are very difficult to get into a diet) can be supplemented with krill oil.
- Fish oil (~2 g/day) is critical *and* affordable, and difficult to get otherwise unless you eat fish every other day.

Consider other supplements that have been scientifically proven to be beneficial (especially once you're [aging](hardship-aging.md)):

- High-dose B vitamins:
  - Folate: ~400 mcg/day
  - B12: ~500 mcg/day
- Acetyl-L-carnitine: ~500 mg/day (assuming your body isn't producing enough naturally) to increase energy and slow aging
- Alpha-lipoic acid: ~100 mg/day or add more spinach, broccoli, potatoes, and organ meats to your diet, increases the potency of antioxidants
- Phosphatidylserine: ~200 mg/day or add more fish, green leafy vegetables, soy products, and rice
- Coenzyme Q10: a powerful antioxidant that reduces certain issues such as heart conditions, diabetes, and physical performance
- L-theanine: 50-200 mg/day or add more green tea to your diet
- Vitamin C: ~500 mg/day (or more if you're at risk of getting sick)
- Vitamin E: ~100 mg, 2x/day (has a relatively short action duration of 2--4 hours)
  - Alpha-tocopherols are the most common form sold in stores, but mixed tocopherols (e.g., alpha and gamma) are more effective.
- Magnesium: ~500 mg right before bed (helps with [sleep](sleep.md))

Other supplements have very limited scientific information about their health benefits, but taking them isn't likely a bad idea because of the [placebo effect](mind-bias.md):

- Ginkgo biloba: 120-240 mg/day
- Geranium extract (or simply grow the plant yourself)

Don't easily trust things that have *severe* risks associated with them:

- Cannabis (marijuana) has been proven to bring some cancers into remission, but is also linked to *severe* brain damage and mental disorders.
