# Business plans for the tech industry

While most [business plans](entrepreneur-3_plan.md) require plenty of assets, the assets tech always needs are computers and tools.

- For things like [distributed hosting](computers-distsys.md) or far-reaching [telecommunications networks](networks-computer.md), you will need a *lot* of hardware.
- If it's a technician or maintenance role, you'll need a wide variety of tools beforehand.
- However, for something like [software development](computers-software.md), you'll only need software tools besides a few computers, and most of them have [open-source](legal-ip-floss.md) alternatives.

One of the most distinctive domains of business plans that contrasts with almost any other business is the freedom of version control. By releasing products to the public in alpha or beta, you have the luxury of selling a product that's *not* complete and *not* tested, but you can start making revenue on it while receiving a wealth of information via bugfix and feature requests.
