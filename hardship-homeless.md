The 1889 Hobo Code of Conduct is applicable to anyone in a survival situation:

1. Decide your life; don't let another person run or rule you.
2. When in town, always respect the local law and officials, and try to be a gentleman at all times.
3. Don't take advantage of someone in a vulnerable situation, locals or other hobos.
4. Continually try to find work, even if temporary, and always seek jobs nobody wants. By doing so, you not only help a business along but ensure employment should you return to that town again.
5. When you can't find employment, create work by using your added talents at crafts.
6. Don't allow yourself to become a stupid drunk and set a bad example for locals' treatment of other hobos.
7. When camping in town, respect handouts, do not wear them out, another hobo will be coming along who will need them as much, if not worse than you.
8. Always respect nature, do not leave garbage where you are camping.
9. If in a community camp, always pitch in and help.
10. Try to stay clean, and wash up wherever possible.
11. When traveling, ride your train respectfully, take no personal risks, cause no problems with the operating crew or host railroad, act like an extra crew member.
12. Don't cause issues in a train yard; another hobo will be coming along who will need passage through that yard.
13. Don't allow other hobos to molest children; expose all molesters to authorities. They are the worst garbage to infest any society.
14. Help all runaway children, and try to inspire them to return home.
15. Help your fellow hobos whenever and wherever needed, you may need their help someday.
