## being productive - optimizing workspace

fonts are VERY important, since they're staring at code all day

## exploring

Sight reading:
download the source code for the software, and start exploring.
How do you know where to look?
What tricks do you use to find your way around a significant body of code?

## finding a mentor

Always try to be the worst musician in the band.
Find a "be the worst" situation for yourself.

Ask old-timers to review your code and make suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct.

A mentor is someone you can trust enough to ask, "What should be different about me as a professional?"

Not only do you create a personal attachment and responsibility to your mentor, but the reverse happens as well. If my role in a relationship is to help someone, I become invested in that person's success.

Nobody has to explicitly ask someone to be their mentor.

Your mentor may not even know they are serving that role for you.

Think of the person in your field whom you admire most.
List the ten most important attributes of this role model.
Choose the attributes that are the reason why you have chosen this person to be your role model.
Rank those qualities in order of importance.
You have now created and distilled a list of attributes that you find admirable and important.
These are the ways in which you should strive to emulate your chosen role model.

For each item on the list, imagine how your role model would rate you on a scale of 1 to 10
Subtract your rating in each row from the importance level you gave it.
That gives you a final priority score

He was just a high-school kid. But, he was already playing gigs, substituting for Little Rock's most respected jazz pianists. Chris was pretty good - especially for his age - but he wasn't that good. It didn't take me long to understand what was happening. When the band we were watching took a set break, Chris would break mid-sentence and just walk away from me to go talk to the band members. He was pushy as hell and would always ask if he could sit in with the band, no matter how inappropriate it seemed to me. He would also ask the musicians for lessons, which meant that he would go to their houses, listen to music, and chat about jazz improvisation with them.

I've seen the same pattern in people I've met in classical music, the American Tibetan Buddhist community, software development.

Really good people won't mind if you want to know them. People like to be appreciated, and they like to talk about the topics they are passionate about. The fact that they are the professional or the guru or the leader or the renowned author doesn't change that they're human and like to interact with other humans.

The gurus are the supernodes in the social and professional network. All it takes to make the connection is a little less humility.

## learning by writing and teaching

Martin Fowler said that whenever he wants to really learn about something, he writes about it.

To really learn something, try teaching it to someone else. There's no better way to crystallize your understanding of something than to force yourself to express it to someone else so that they can understand it.

We internally work through the reasons why one analogy seems to work but doesn't and another analogy would seem not to work but does. When you teach, you have to answer questions that may have never occurred to you.

Helping someone is a job you can't be laid off from.

## learning elsewhere

the best programmers are the ones who have hobbies and interests that are NOT within the domain of software development
- this allows them to be much more [creative], meaning they can frame better logic

## learning from others

How do others strategically use variable, function, and structure naming?

There is no hidden source code for a painting or a piece of music. If you can hear the music or see the piece of art, you can learn from it.

As you look at this code with a critical eye, you will start to develop your own tastes, just as you would for music, art, or literature. Various styles and devices will amuse you, amaze you, anger you, and (I hope) challenge you.

You will learn more about what already exists.

Pick a project, and read it like a book.
Make notes. Outline the good and the bad.
Write a critique, and publish it.
Find at least one trick or pattern that you can use from it.
Find at least one bad thing that you observed that you will add to your "What not to do" checklist.

You should read good code.

You have to actively copy, widely and unashamedly. This applies to a lot of things, of course. Hunter S. Thompson didn't just read good books; he typed out Hemingway and Fitzgerald.

Copying builds muscle memory. You get a feel for the nuance and form of the original - the kind of detail that's lost in a quick scan.

## Learning

NOTE: the content references and merges w/ AL Memory

## loving programming

Programming: I was addicted, but in a good way. My drive to create had been ignited in much the same way that it had when I started writing classical music or playing improvisational jazz. I was obsessed with learning anything and everything I could. I wasn't in this for a new career. In fact, many of my musician friends thought of it as an irresponsible distraction from my actual career. I was in it because I couldn't not be.

This was the difference between me and my overeducated, underperforming colleagues at work. Passion.

The greats in various fields, this same pattern of addictive, passionate behavior surfaces. Jazz saxophone great John Coltrane reportedly practiced so much that his lips would bleed.

## practicing

When you practice music, it shouldn't sound good. If you always sound good during practice sessions, it means you're not stretching your limits. That's what practice is for.

Can you imagine a professional musician getting onstage and replicating the gibberish from my university's practice rooms? It wouldn't be tolerated. Musicians are paid to perform in public - not to practice.

I started experimenting with programming exercises modeled after my musical practice sessions.
Rule number one was that the software I was developing couldn't be something I wanted to use.
I didn't want to cut corners, rushing to an end goal.
So, I wrote software that wasn't useful.
I cut no corners but was frustrated to find that a lot of the ideas I had while practicing weren't working.
Though I was trying to do as good a job as possible, the designs and code I was creating weren't as elegant as I had hoped they'd be.
Looking back on it now, I see that the awkward feeling I got from these experiences was a good sign.
My code wasn't completely devoid of brilliant moments. But I was stretching my mental muscles and building my coding chops.

Practice at your limits.

Got any favorite pieces of open source software? How about trying to add a feature?
Go look at the to-do list for a piece of software you'd like to practice with, and give yourself a constrained amount of time to implement the new feature.

This is an exercise you can practice often and in short periods of time. You don't actually have to implement the feature. Just use it as a starting point. The real goal is to understand what you're looking at as quickly as possible. Be sure to vary the software you work with. Try different types of software in different styles and languages. Take note of issues that make it easier or harder for you to find your way around.
What patterns are you developing that help you work through the code?
What virtual bread crumbs do you leave for yourself to help you navigate as you move up and down the call stack of a complex piece of functionality?

A great way to sharpen the mind and improve your improvisational coding skills is to practice with self-imposed constraints.
Pick a simple program, and try to write it with these constraints.
My favorite exercise is to write a program that prints the lyrics to the tired old song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
How could you write such a program without doing any variable assignments?

How fast can you code this program?
How about practicing small, difficult problems with a timer?

Code Kata, which are small, thought-provoking exercises that programmers can do in the language of their choice. Each kata emphasizes a specific technique or thought process, providing a concrete flexing of one's mental muscles. Work through all twenty-one kata.

Listening to music, therefore, is not a passive activity for a jazz musician. It is study. Furthermore, the ability to understand what you're hearing is a skill that you develop over time.

Studying the work of masters is an essential part of becoming a master.

## practicing with time constraints and the present

"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

The sad thing is that even when you don't want it to be this way, you can fall into the trap, especially when there are tasks you don't really want to do.
In the case of a weekend coding race, you don't have time to put tasks off, so you don't.
You can't delay making a decision, so you don't.
You can't avoid the boring work, and you know that you have to do it so quickly that nothing can get too boring.

A sense of urgency, even if manufactured, is enough to easily double or triple your productivity. Try it, and you'll see. You can do it faster. You can do it now. You can get it done instead of talking about getting it done. If you treat your projects like a race, you'll get to the end a lot faster.

Keeping your mind focused on the present will get you further toward your goals than keeping your mind focused on the goal.

If you're always walking around with your head in the clouds, You'll always be waiting for the big one while ignoring the little things that happen every day.

What if you tried to do the boring stuff perfectly?

Martin renamed forty-hour workweek to "eight-hour burn." The idea is that you should work so relentlessly that there is no way that you could continue longer than eight hours. When you have too much time to work, your work time reduces significantly in perceived value. If you have seventy hours available, each hour is less precious to you than when you have forty hours available. Eight-hour burn places a constraint on you and gives you a strategy for dealing with that constraint. You get to work and think, I've only got eight hours! Go, go, go!

If you work intensely every day, you'll find that the work doesn't follow you home. Not only are you deliberately stopping yourself from working after-hours, but your mind will actually allow you to stop working after-hours.

Chris would actually plan down to how he was going to use the fifteen minutes between classes to fit in practice routines that could be done quickly.

## prototyping

A prototype is worth a thousand meetings - Mike Davidson

## Staying Sharp

## from former TS webpage

To stay employed, you must be seen as a vital part of the company. This comes by your fulfilling several things at once:

1. Your skills are relevant to your manager's needs.
2. Your manager thinks you're a better alternative than anyone they could interview in the wild.
3. You're too important to lose.

Many tech workers try to satisfy #3 at the expense of #2 by making it arbitrarily difficult to follow what they're doing, such as making overly complicated [algorithms](https://icould.fail/algorithms/) or maintaining an inferior platform or codebase instead of using something easier.

However, the wiser way to keep yourself employed is to do what nobody else _wants_ to do. It's higher-risk and sometimes more unpleasant, but making your boss happy with your willingness to take on hard challenges will also make your boss afraid of losing you.

Some of these unpleasant things will never be fashionable to tech workers:

[Software automation](https://icould.fail/prog-habits/)
is _amazing_, but it's not possible to entirely automate everything, and some things are destined to be difficult.
- One of the more crucial components of working on a team is being able to handle [conflicts](https://adequate.life/conflicts/) with your peers and managers well, _not_ just being "really good" at something.

Most people won't want to make the changes because they're often uphill. But, for the rest who take that road, it [builds character](https://gainedin.site/morality/) and makes life more [meaningful](https://gainedin.site/meaning/).

Don't let yourself just be the best in the bunch. Be the person and do the things that people can't not talk about.

## tracking trends

Carve out weekly time to investigate the bleeding edge.

Research new technologies and to start to develop skills in them. Do hands-on work with these new technologies.

Watch the alpha geeks.

Rigid values make you fragile.

The big problems I have successfully solved in my life. The secret is to focus on making whatever it is you're trying to improve better today than it was yesterday. That's it. It's easy.

## trying projects again

Try a small project, twice. Try it once in your home base technology and then once, as idiomatically as possible, in a competing technology.

It is the subjective idea that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality—that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

> * It seems ridiculous that a surgeon needs to write her name (with a Sharpie) on the limb that she’s about to operate on, but this simple system adjustment means that errors involving working on the wrong limb will go to zero.

> * Life is too short (really) to zoom past it.
> * People who survive (and grow) are the ones who stay in the moment, concentrate and strive to deliver their best.
> * Quality never comes from rushing through things.
> * Just because you can do so many things doesn’t mean you should attempt all of them.
> * Rushing too fast through these is a risk, it is a killer. You never savor the moment, be in the present and enjoy the process. You end up ‘doing’ so much that there is no time to ‘ruminate’

### Slow programming principles

* No broken window. A repo should always be in a clean and working state, i.e the last commit should always build successfully.
* If you broke it, take ownership for the repair. If you break something, you are responsible of the situation, fix it (it's ok to ask for help).
* Avoid branching/batching your changes | Be careful what you batch. Changes and version bumps should be integrated continuously, not all at once.
* Don't hide your work, branch instead, and get it reviewed before creating a PR / merging it.
* If possible, don't branch, work on trunk/main. Branching/Feature flags can help.
* Use Peer code review, if possible pre-commit reviews. Peer code review is a key element in building a robust and egoless engineering culture of collaborative problem-solving ([source](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/cicd-pipeline))
* If you change the principles/systems/processess, do it incrementally. Developer productivity matters a lot. Minimize friction. e.g don't do a migration of all CI/CD Ecosystem in a way that breaks everything for a while. Do it step by step, phase the changes. Make it possible to rollback easily to previous working state.
* Quality first | Quality is always right. If you’re doing CI and for some reason the integration fails, that means the broken build becomes the highest priority to fix before continuing to add more features. System quality—not just velocity—is important. CI works in three simple stages: push, test, and fix. But despite this simplicity, CI might become challenging if only a few members of the team practice it. Consequently, CI also requires a change in culture and support from management. [source](https://stackify.com/what-is-cicd-whats-important-and-how-to-get-it-right/)
  * There is never enough time to do it right yet we find time to do it again and again. Jack Bergman?
* Refactoring can only truly begin once you've actually learned what a piece of code or some data structure did, the unique properties for which they were written or chosen. Anything else is setting yourself up for failure. [source](https://ferd.ca/lessons-learned-while-working-on-large-scale-server-software.html)
* It also means that when building systems, you should not assume that operators will do things correctly. Expect failure from people. Try to think about tools you can give them to undo their mistakes, because they will happen sooner or later. Have some dread. Be understanding. Know things won't be perfect. [source](https://ferd.ca/lessons-learned-while-working-on-large-scale-server-software.html)
* Study your tools, see how you work, understand how you can improve it. Don't rush. Before you run, you have to learn to walk. 
  * Whether you’re getting a lot of satisfaction from being busy or just feeling exasperated, don’t forget to occasionally stop and ask yourself: Is this the best use of time?
  * Improve systems : Improving systems helps remove busywork from an employee’s day, but it also makes things easier for the customer. 
  * See also: [Ref : How Being Busy Kills Productivity](https://www.hellosign.com/blog/busy-kills-productivity) on how doing less can help you be more productive
  * Focus on results; not time : Time tracking is unavoidable in some instances, but rather than the rule by which companies operate, it should be used as a secondary metric to the results they achieve. Rather than give an employee a 2-hour window to do a job, have her do it right the first time (bonus points for documenting the process), then review and adjust your future plans based on time tracking data.
* Do one thing at a time. Only one item under your name in the WIP. The rest will wait. You cannot fix all things.
* Test the crap out of everything you do before telling anyone you are "finished". See also [Ref : Being a slow programmer](https://shansvex.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/being-a-slow-programmer/)
* Use right tools for the job (email != todo list, PR and commits != code documentation, Jenkins != long term storage for releases/versions/build info/state of quality of your code)
* Love what you have. Using boring technology. Don't get distracted too often with shiny tools that reinvent the wheel.
* Write less code, read more than you write. Read more tips, manuals, blogs, articles, watch presentations and listen to podcasts about your programming craft. Learn from others prior to writing bugs. As with culture and and knowledge, you are the books you read, the films you watch, the music you listen to, the people you spend time with, the conversations you engage in. Choose wisely what you feed your mind with, and it's true with code as well. See also [Ref : Being a slow programmer](https://shansvex.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/being-a-slow-programmer/) and [Ref : Learn to Read the Source, Luke](https://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/)
* Learn how to write clean code, and repeat. So when you will have to rush, you will not forget to do your work right, and you will naturally provide more quality work. Also you will tend to detect issues earlier before they hit production, i.e during reviews, and writing better code will lead the whole team in getting a better codebase you can all be proud of, which mean work will become more agreeable. 
* Do your research, don't always rush in coding or in reinventing the wheel. You will learn a lot through research.
* Don't react yet. Take a little time before taking action / reacting to a task/request/message. It allows you to think more about your answer / action. Also, ask yourself if you really need to take action now for this task, or if it can wait later in the day/week. Check if you're not giving the task more focus/consideration than it deserves.
  * Wait before jumping immediately on every opportunity/request/problem. Don’t touch it / don’t (re)act too soon
  * :star: Respond rather than react
  * Before you write any code, think first about what problem this is solving and for whom. See also: [Ref : Think first about what problem this is solving and for whom](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2021/01/18/think-first-about-what-problem-this-is-solving-and-for-whom/)
  * The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often. [Ref : Give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) 
  * See also: [Ref : How Being Busy Kills Productivity](https://www.hellosign.com/blog/busy-kills-productivity) on how doing less can help you be more productive
* Reuse existing code. GitHub is your friend.
* Discipline / Consistency beat motivation and quality. 
* You don't want heroes, but you might benefit from experts / excellents colleagues / colleagues & managers that provide support and insights and who do not let you take everyting on your plate.
* Simplify. Become a minimalist. 
* Don't be overconfident | the fallacy of skipping the planning stage. Some tasks look simple at first glance, but it can hide some challenges. Take the time needed to run your analysis and estimate the effort after you have checked all possible impacts you could check. Overestimating is one thing, but underestimating the effort and challenge can really lead to getting cascade issues and mistakes that would add a lot of pressure on every team and lead then to rushing even more and causing even bigger mistakes. See also [Ref : Skipping the planning stage](https://www.caines.ca/blog/2009/12/13/code-slower/)
* Writing classes and functions that do a lot. 
* Be helpful not harmful, fix things and care more about your impact.  You have a big responsibility on your hands, and you should take it seriously. The world needs as much care and conscience as we can muster. Defend your users against anti-patterns and shady business practices. Raise your hand and object to harmful design ideas. Call out bad stuff when you see it. Thoughtfully reflect on what you’re sending out into the world every day. See also: [Ref : Move Slowly and Fix Things](https://m.signalvnoise.com/move-slowly-and-fix-things/)
* Comment.
  * More so than all other tools (issue tracker, code management system, etc.) comments in code have the greatest chance of still being around and easily searchable if they haven't been deleted. See also: [Ref : The case for comments in code](https://notes.eatonphil.com/the-case-for-comments-in-code.html)
  * Code can’t self-document if it isn’t there. If you decide to not write some code and don’t leave a comment explaining why, there will be nothing left to explain what you were thinking! Add comments that explain why the code is doing what it is doing, or is structured the way that it is structured. See also: [Ref : How to write readable code](https://jeremymikkola.com/posts/2021_02_02_how_to_write_readable_code.html)
* When you're done with your commit and push, just double check what you have just done. Sometimes issues or possible improvements appear obvious only when the work is already pushed. Next time, slow down and double check before pushing ;-) 
* Make your app fail fast in case of error. Ignoring errors will have side effects and can cause even more harm than if you just had the app crashing on first error.
* Focus on simplicity. The answer is always there. [source](https://blog.strategicedge.co.uk/2013/03/tidy-up-as-you-go-along-be-it-cooking-diy-or-selling-your-software-solution-remember-the-small-stuff-as-it-is-big-stuf.html)

### Slow programming Healthy tips / helpers
* Disconnect & Focus. Value your time, use it to focus. Put lot of non-meeting blocks in your agenda. 
* Stay positive. Focus on what is doing ok, what you have accomplished. Focus your brain attention more often on something that is stress free.
* Limit your coffee intake. 
  * Drinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight-or-flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. [source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140805002649-50578967-how-successful-people-stay-calm/)
  * Less caffeine. More hot water and sliced ginger. [source](https://blog.strategicedge.co.uk/2013/03/tidy-up-as-you-go-along-be-it-cooking-diy-or-selling-your-software-solution-remember-the-small-stuff-as-it-is-big-stuf.html)
* Get enough sleep. 
  * When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Stressful projects often make you feel as if you have no time to sleep, but taking the time to get a decent night’s sleep is often the one thing keeping you from getting things under control. [source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140805002649-50578967-how-successful-people-stay-calm/)
  * The alarm clock is for back-up. Not wake up: get enough sleep. [source](https://blog.strategicedge.co.uk/2013/03/tidy-up-as-you-go-along-be-it-cooking-diy-or-selling-your-software-solution-remember-the-small-stuff-as-it-is-big-stuf.html)
* Look for help | Use your support system. It’s tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by yourself. To be calm and productive, you need to recognize your weaknesses and ask for help when you need it. This means tapping into your support system when a situation is challenging enough for you to feel overwhelmed. Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as talking about your worries will provide an outlet for your anxiety and stress and supply you with a new perspective on the situation. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation. Asking for help will mitigate your stress and strengthen your relationships with those you rely upon. [source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140805002649-50578967-how-successful-people-stay-calm/)
* Breathe. The practice of being in the moment with your breathing will begin to train your brain to focus solely on the task at hand and get the stress monkey off your back. When you’re feeling stressed, take a couple of minutes to focus on your breathing. Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in a chair and breathe. The goal is to spend the entire time focused only on your breathing, which will prevent your mind from wandering. Think about how it feels to breathe in and out. This sounds simple, but it’s hard to do for more than a minute or two. It’s all right if you get sidetracked by another thought; this is sure to happen at the beginning, and you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. If staying focused on your breathing proves to be a real struggle, try counting each breath in and out until you get to 20, and then start again from 1. Don’t worry if you lose count; you can always just start over. [source](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140805002649-50578967-how-successful-people-stay-calm/)
* Drink / eat well.  
  * Don’t forget to drink water, get sunlight, and that we are basically a house plant with complicated feelings. [source](https://twitter.com/TheWeirdWorld/status/930155807651528706)
  * Often when we think we are hungry we are simply thirsty. Drink water first. [source](https://blog.strategicedge.co.uk/2013/03/tidy-up-as-you-go-along-be-it-cooking-diy-or-selling-your-software-solution-remember-the-small-stuff-as-it-is-big-stuf.html)
  * Drink decent tea and coffee. Do the simple pleasures properly. [source](https://blog.strategicedge.co.uk/2013/03/tidy-up-as-you-go-along-be-it-cooking-diy-or-selling-your-software-solution-remember-the-small-stuff-as-it-is-big-stuf.html)
  * Eat slowly
* Let things blow up from time to time, you're not your work, don't feel you are not responsible for everything within your employer's company, and your employer is more resilient than you think.
* Check your posture. It will reflect how you are treating your body. [source](https://blog.strategicedge.co.uk/2013/03/tidy-up-as-you-go-along-be-it-cooking-diy-or-selling-your-software-solution-remember-the-small-stuff-as-it-is-big-stuf.html)
* [Unix Sheikh](https://www.unixsheikh.com/about.html)
    software engineering principles
> * Simplicity: The system should always be as simple and small as possible. When software projects grow, so do errors and bugs. Techniques such as line-by-line inspection of software, relevant unit testing, and physical examination of hardware that implements protection mechanisms are great. For such techniques to be successful a small and simple design is essential. This is sometimes described as the KISS principle and YAGNI.
> * Least privilege: Each user and program should operate using the fewest privileges possible.
> * Open design: In order for a system to be secure it must never depend on attacker ignorance. Instead the design should be based upon technology that depend upon public scrutiny - whenever possible.
> * Complete mediation: Every access attempt must be checked and validated.
> * Easy to use: The human interface must be as easy and intuitive to use as possible. Easy and simple is always better than smart and fancy. Simple user testing is a great way to get valuable feedback.
> * Usability: Well known usability standards should be met if required.
> * Discrimination: User discrimination is never good. User discrimination is when an application only works for a very limited amount of systems, like when a website only works with JavaScript enabled even though it doesn't provide any functionality that really requires JavaScript.
> * Documentation: Lacking or inadequate documentation is a bug. Everything needs to be adequately documented from the very beginning, it is an integrate part of software development. I strongly abhor poor or lacking documentation.


[Jeremy Mikkola](https://jeremymikkola.com/posts/2021_02_02_how_to_write_readable_code.html)
(2021) How to write readable code
> * Prioritize Clarity : The first step to writing clear code is to make it a priority.
> * Develop a sense for clarity : requires knowing what clear code looks like.
> * Edit : Reading back over what you just wrote will help give ideas for how to improve it.
> * Start by explaining : start by explaining what needs to be done as though you are telling it to another person (or rubber duck). Write it down. Take that explanation and transform it into code.
> * Comments : Code can’t self-document if it isn’t there. If you decide to not write some code and don’t leave a comment explaining why, there will be nothing left to explain what you were thinking!
> * Don’t mix levels : Mixing levels of abstraction makes the reader jump between thinking about what is being done and how it is implemented.
> * Break out functions - :duck: self-comment here : It's true to some extent, but breaking a code in too many functions can also force jumping a lot between code locations. So I would say it depends on the semantic and scope distance between those functions. 
> * Don’t break out functions : DRY starts to go too far when two functions that happen to share a handful of lines become a target for deduplication. The test for whether some pieces of code should be deduplicated is simple: would anything bad happen if one was changed without also changing the other? If the answer is yes, then make a single source of truth for it. If not, consider leaving it alone. - :duck: self-comment : exactly... what I just wrote above :-) 
> * Avoid configurable functions : Prefer many functions to a few, configurable functions, i.e It’s much better to have multiple functions, each of which does just one thing.
> * Don’t prematurely optimize

> When dealing with build tools, a few things become apparent:
> * if you make the build tool simple, it won't handle all the weird edge cases that exist out there
> * if you want to handle the weird edge cases, you need to deviate from whatever norm you wanted to establish
> * if you want ease of use for common defaults, the rules for common defaults must be shared between the tool and the users, who shape their systems to fit the tool's expectations
> * if you allow configuration or scripting, you give the users a way to specify the rules that must be shared, so the tool fits their systems
> * if you want to keep the tool simple, you have to force your users to only play within the parameters that fit this simplicity
> * if your users' use cases don't map well to your simplicity, they will build shims around your tool to attain their objectives

[Ben Hoyt](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)
(2021) The small web is beautiful
> * Fewer moving parts. It’s easier to create more robust systems and to fix things when they do go wrong.
> * Small software is faster. Fewer bits to download and clog your computer’s memory.
> * Reduced power consumption. This is important on a “save the planet” scale, but also on the very local scale of increasing the battery life of your phone and laptop.
> * The light, frugal aesthetic. That’s personal, I know, but as you’ll see, I’m not alone.
