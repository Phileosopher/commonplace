# List of specific data visualizations

This is a list of various types of specific data visualizations.

## Bar chart

A *very* simple representation of several specific values in comparison to one another.

- This can sometimes present with multiple groupings across time, but require very little data.

## Fishbone diagram

A type of diagram that attempts to demonstrate cause-and-effect within a complex system.

- It is generally unwieldy to look at, so use it carefully.

## Funnel chart

A funnel-shaped chart meant to represent stages or processes.

- It tends to be a graphical enhancement more than adding specific value to the observer.

## Flowchart

A flow chart represents a flow of [logic](logic.md) (especially across time) or [decisions](https://gainedin.slite/decisions/).

It represents as the following:

1. Indicate an element
2. An arrow points to the next element
3. Indicate the second element
4. An arrow points to the next
5. Repeat

This can represent diverging paths (e.g., [decision-making](people-decisions.md)), or can repreesent a sequence of events.

The general appearance of flow charts allows a visual representation of complexities that would otherwise be difficult to show via text.

## Gantt chart

A Gantt chart is highly valuable within the scope of [project management](mgmt-2_projects.md). It essentially captures the estimated duration of various project phases, which allows managers to know how much time a project will take.

## Line graph

A representation across time, with each data point in fixed intervals connected by a line.

- Sometimes the line can be curved if it's meant to represent a trend, but would more effectively work on a scatter plot.

## Mind map

Less of a data visualization and more of a visual representation of ideas and their connections between each other.

## Pie chart / circle diagram

A visual representation of the percentages of a collective amount.

- The only data requirement is that the information derives to a percent value.

## Sankey diagram

A Sankey diagram is useful to represent flows of varying information within a sequence of stages. It is visually reminiscent of a [circulatory system](body.md).

The diagram is composed of a "web" of mostly parallel labeled elements and "blocks" where the elements congregate.

The easiest way to understand Sankey diagrams is through the source data:

1. Have a cohort of various types of groups in a
2. Show their convergence into a solid block
3. Show a separate and independently different cohort departing the block

## Scatter plot diagram

A visual representation of the relationship between two variables with many bits of data dotted on it.

- Often, an approximate line passes through the scatter plot to represent a [trend](trends.md).

## Swimlane diagrams

Visualization of multiple phases and their connected elements to show how different phases connect with smaller components.

- It is often a block diagram embedded behind a flowchart.

## Tree diagram

A visual demonstration of multiple branching paths.

- It requires multiple tiers, with V-shaped connections to show how two elements have a relationship to a greater one.
- A subdomain of tree diagrams is the organizational chart (or "org chart").

## Venn diagram

A semi-overlapping diagram that shows the relationships and exclusive elements between things.

- This is one of the few diagrams that works on *all* forms of comparative data, even when non-numeric.
