# Why job hunting skills matter

What you do today ripples onto the rest of your life.

Since you spend almost half your waking hours in a full-time job, even some thought about it will dramatically [improve your life](success-1_why.md).

The average person goes through 12-15 job changes in their lifetime, so job-seeking is nearly inevitable.

The first 5 years of your career often sets the pace for the rest of it:

- You can recover from some mistakes relatively quickly, but others may haunt you for decades.

Changing jobs is usually worth the risk:

- You will *always* get more experience from something you haven't tried than something you have.
- People who take the plunge to find a better job are usually [happier](mind-feelings-happiness.md) from it.

To find the right job, you need a long-term goal:

- Your boss manages your job's goals, but *you* manage your career!
- Your career should combine your preferences and abilities to balance what you want and need.
- If you want a career with an unreliable wage (like a [creative](mind-creativity.md) line of work), have a backup career that makes a basic living wage.

At the same time, finding [happiness](mind-feelings-happiness-perma.md) *in* work is a broader problem than simply finding enjoyable work, so don't expect perfect satisfaction simply from the work.

## Many self-destructive career decisions sound good at the time

Don't overachieve:

- Pretending to have hobbies or expertise you don't have.
- Making decisions that only give more money.
- Overworking yourself and sacrificing your [happiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md).
- Prioritizing your work over your personal life.
- Micro-managing everything.
- Fearing mistakes and failure.

Don't settle or pursue laziness:

- Settling for mediocre.
- Making careless mistakes.
- Not giving your best.
- Wanting a remote-only job without counting the burden on your personal life.
- Working toward a promotion to [management](mgmt-1_why.md) to have an easier life.

Don't "follow your passion" if it doesn't pay:

- Many people quit jobs that could have served as great starting-points toward future jobs because they didn't like what they did.
- While it's great to find a job you enjoy, your current job should provide at least some sense of stability with a sufficiently livable income.

## Only leave a job for good reasons

Only move into something better, not away from something you don't like.

If you have a bad attitude, you'll eventually bring it to your new job:

- Dissatisfaction isn't always cynicism, but cynicism always creates dissatisfaction.
- With the [right attitude](success-2_attitude.md), you can learn to be [happy and satisfied](mind-feelings-happiness.md) anywhere!

Self-assess your feelings about your present and future job:

- [Write out](language-writing.md) the pros and cons from all possible career decisions you can make.
- Examine how you describe your work in conversations.
- Think ahead to the feelings you'll experience from making each choice.

### Some good reasons to find another job

The job ruins your personal life:

- You fear or dread going to work.
- Weekends make the first day of the next workweek unbearable.
- Your work makes you cranky and irritable off-duty.

You can't [identify](identity.md) with the organization:

- You don't feel your work adds value to anything.
- You don't feel others in your workplace hear your ideas.
- You don't like spending time with your coworkers.
- The company doesn't fulfill your life's purposes.
- You're the victim of verbal abuse, sexual harassment, or other illegal behaviors.
- The company's [culture](people-culture.md) has changed toward something you don't like.

You don't see your future with the company:

- Top management has made advancement impossible.
- You can't see yourself at the company in a year (about the maximum length needed to find another job).
- You don't see an opportunity to grow or learn from your work.
- Your career goals have changed and don't align with the company anymore.
- Your company will cease operations in the foreseeable future, or you may not be needed within 6-12 months.

The position obstructs one of your main life goals:

- You're prepared to [start your own business](entrepreneur-1_why.md).
- You're [getting married](relationships-3_marriage.md) or [having a child](parenting-1_babies.md) and want to be a homemaker.
- You're trying to [move](home-moving.md) to a region the company doesn't cover or won't authorize the transfer.

You've changed as a person:

- Your goals and values have adapted or improved.
- A different type of work fulfills you than when you started.
- You want a challenge or something new that your position can't give you.
- You're no longer happy doing the work you once loved.
- In the course of your duties, you've found something specific you would enjoy doing for hours at a time.

If you see anything unethical, you're risking your reputation every day you're there, so leave it as quickly as possible.

To stay [legally safe](legal-safety.md), carefully consider any [non-compete clauses](people-contracts.md) you may have signed for your current and recent roles.

## Job-hopping has pros and cons

You should stay in a job for at least fifteen months to ensure you don't invalidate prior work experience.

Moving frequently between jobs has some drawbacks:

- Potential employers see you as disloyal and uncommitted.
- Since most companies lay off their newest workers, you lose some job security.
- You can't add the long-term impact of your work to your resume because you won't see it.
- Every time you change jobs, you sabotage your network.
- Leaving a job means the company won't hire you internally elsewhere.

But, done right, rapid job-hopping has some hidden benefits:

- More work experience across various industries makes you more [creative](mind-creativity.md) and indispensable.
- If you know what you're doing, you can build a [potent professional network](people-4_friends.md).
- You can quickly upgrade your title, salary, and benefits after only a few years.

However, staying in the same position or the *wrong* position for a long time will make you look unambitious:

- Even if you're happy with your simple job, you should slowly migrate to positions with greater responsibility as you gain experience.
  - There are usually very similar jobs in other companies with a more embellished title (e.g., Customer Service Representative vs. Customer Care Specialist).
- On any entry-level job, most hiring managers expect you to move into another role within 3-5 years.
- To stay marketable and competitive, your career should *not* be a straight line.

If you keep job-hopping long enough, you *must* develop patience and stay in a stable job for a few years to "reset" your situation.

## Capture and measure all the work you've done

With all the changes you'll make, [organize what you have](organization.md) *before* you start looking.

Archive and save *everything* that shows the work you've done at that job:

- After you've given notice of leaving, it's possible you won't have access to your own work anymore.
- Download your contacts and customers lists from all company-owned devices.
- Save copies of documents you've made that highlight your accomplishments.
- Only save copies of things that aren't the company's [intellectual property](legal-ip.md).

When you're okay with others knowing, ask for reference letters from key coworkers who know you, and give them 3--5 items you want them to include if they don't have much time.

If you have one, closely research the exact restrictions of your non-competition or non-disclosure agreement (which may include legal counsel).

If you're losing your job soon, update your [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/) and [resume](jobs-3_image.md) while you're still employed.

Alert your references in advance about receiving a call from another employer and request for them to praise your past work.

## If you're starting your career

You won't get a glamorous job:

- Unless you're well-connected, expect to find work that's hard labor, in fast food, or tedious.
- Even when you find an excellent job, nobody in your workplace will respect you for months until you've proven yourself.

Make a list of any relevant volunteer experience, extracurricular activities or hobbies that could interest an employer:

- Clubs or organizations
- Team and individual sports
- Church involvement
- Plays and performances
- Volunteering in retirement centers, animal shelters, and homeless shelters
- Any hobbies that involved building something

Don't go to [college](jobs-college.md) to find a job unless you have a full-ride scholarship.

Your best chance of building a professional network comes through helping others succeed, not necessarily from becoming better at anything, so work toward benefiting others more than getting an education.

## If you were fired or laid off

When you'll be [unemployed](hardship-unemployment.md) soon, feverishly search to avoid a gap in employment.

If you don't promptly quit or get fired at least once in your career, you're not trying enough:

- This fast-paced world requires risks, and some will backfire in a job loss.
- If you have major mental issues or personal problems, getting fired is the wake-up call you may have needed.
- If you learn from your mistakes, your job loss can become your success story.

Many reasons for getting fired should provoke you to do some serious soul-searching:

- Extreme negativity
- Promising something you didn't deliver
- Trying to "sell" something unrelated to the company inside the company
- Insufficient [emotional intelligence](people-3_respect.md)
- Misusing company resources or supplies
- Speaking wrongly or presumptuously on behalf of the company
- Multiple back-to-back firings or quitting

However, some things are worth getting fired over:

- [Principles or values](values.md) you stand for
- An abusive work environment
- Unhealthy favoritism or family-style dysfunctional roles playing out in a company

If you've gotten fired, don't make any major life decisions for at *least* 3 months:

- Most dumb career decisions come through [depression](mind-feelings-sadness.md) and [anger](mind-feelings-anger.md).
- Let go of the anger and [find inner happiness](mind-feelings-happiness-stress.md).
- Focus all your frustrations on finding a new job as soon as possible.

As much as it may hurt and feel alienating, nobody will care about your unemployment as much as you:

- This world is harsh, and genuine empathy about unemployment is rare.
- Despite the circumstances, learn [satisfaction and gratitude](mind-feelings-happiness-focus.md), and try to be a better comfort to others in their situation than how you may have experienced.

Download your bank statement and figure out how much money you have left:

1. [Make a budget](money-3_budget.md) and find what you can cut to survive until the next job.
2. Make a general best-case and worst-case prediction about how long your money will last.
   - Consider alternative situations that could make your money last longer (e.g., [moving](home-moving.md) in with family, [government aid](bureaucracy.md)).
3. Treat the worst-case scenario as your deadline to start work, which, depending on the industry, takes 3-30 days to start after a successful interview.
4. If you go past that deadline, shift to a state of [prolonged unemployment](hardship-unemployment.md).

Even if you were let go, your work results at that company might still be useful:

- If you were terminated, do *not* use your boss as a reference: use a coworker you were [friends with](people-4_friends.md) at the time instead.
- It's not your fault for things you couldn't have prevented.
- However, if automation made your job obsolete, try to avoid looking for a similar future role.

While termination is the end of something, it's the beginning of something else, and it's impossible to lose if you don't give up!

## Brainstorm what you want

Finding a new job is a giant endeavor, so make sure you're ready for the experience.

When you're ready to consider another job, it's time to [start making plans](jobs-2_goals.md).
