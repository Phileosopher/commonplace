# Running a worship-based church

Technically, *all* groups of people serving in a ministry capacity are a "church".

- However, while [society](trends.md) and [technology](technology.md) has moved around quite a bit, most of the *worship-based* Church uses [a model that hasn't changed much in over 1,500 years](history-church.md).

From the exterior, it *looks* different, but those differences are largely cosmetic.

- Most Christian churches are conducting the exact same worship of Jesus, though the emotional thrust of the worship will vary dramatically.

The entire convergence on this page is *not* precise, but accurate-enough.

- It's important to note that the *order* of most rituals move around constantly.
- Denominations have been split over relatively minor aspects like placement of elements and choice of music.
- While the Catholic Church suppresses *all* dissent, Protestantism has a vast and immeasurable range of permutations to every single rite.

## How rituals/sacraments matter

Most of the conventions that make a "typical" church are borrowed from a few source traditions:

1. The Hebrew temple had many traditions established (many of them from [Levitical law](https://biblehub.com/bsb/leviticus/1.htm)).
2. After the Temple fell in [2 Kings 24:10-14](https://biblehub.com/bsb/2_kings/24.htm), the Hebrew people maintained their worship by adapting the rituals for synagogue "mini-Temples", which included many rituals *not* in Hebrew law.
3. New followers of Christ [imitated synagogue tradition](history-church.md) (mostly) and added their own adaptations.
4. As Gentiles arrived, some traditions were removed or permuted to accommodate non-Hebrews.
5. By approximately 200 AD, the Catholic Church later codified and standardized those traditions.
6. Within a few centuries, the Catholic traditions were practically the law, and the cultural assimilation meant pagan rituals merged into the practice.
7. Starting in 1517, the Protestant Church *removed* many of those traditions, but didn't add many.

The [Bible](bible.md) itself only has a few verses that indicate daily details on how to run a church:

- *Some* sacraments (i.e., communion/Eucharist and baptism), though on a more personal level and without many details.
- Specific qualifications necessary within people you wish to appoint as [leaders](mgmt-church.md).
- Almost every other Bible verse about the church are simply [patterned expansions](symbols.md) into a [corporate culture](groups-small.md) from living among [family and friends](people-family.md).

However, across a few thousand years, the Church *has* had some good ideas.

- Those ideas may or may not be good for your [culture](people-culture.md), and they're not necessary to run a church.
- The things you pick-and-choose should conform to [how that congregation is gifted](spiritual-gifts.md) and [how God designed them](identity.md).

While [Christian rituals](mgmt-church-worship-rituals.md) are *very* heavily inspired by Jewish and pagan tradition, the [redemption in Christ](jesus-gospel.md) makes the entire experience direct into a different form towards the [unknown](unknown.md).

- Further, *how* the rituals are performed can create a dramatic difference in how the congregants interpret it.

Each denomination derives a certain form of [meaning](meaning.md) over rituals by *their* interpretation.

- Over the centuries, many of the rituals have been expanded *far* beyond the Bible, and the biblical basis is either [nonexistent](theology-solae.md) or only partly applicable.

To that end, this is an attempt to indicate all the ways you *could* do church.

- You can, however, apply any Bible verses about living well on an individual level to make new rituals and sacraments, which will likely spin into [a different denomination](history-church.md) over time.
- A church should develop its own creativity in discovering new ways to live more like Christ ([Hebrews 10:24-25](https://biblehub.com/bsb/hebrews/10.htm)).

Therefore, while most of the essays here use Bible citations, this page doesn't call for an exhaustive listing.

- If a believer has read through the Bible at least once, they should be able to see what the pattern is and why it would make sense.

None of the following are technically "necessary" for any salvation-based matters.

- The Bible makes it clear that God saves us, not the way we conduct our rituals ([Ephesians 2:8-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/2.htm)).
- Instead, a ritual's purpose is the same as any other [spiritual exercise](spiritual-exercises.md): to create a [habitual rhythm](habits.md) that fosters [virtuous living](morality.md).
- Religious observance also creates a type of [group cohesion](values.md) through a [shared purpose](purpose.md).
- However, *not* everyone works the same way, and [each person must travel their own pathway](https://theologos.site/devotion-chaos/) ([1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/8.htm), [Romans 14:1-12](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/14.htm)).

## Statement of faith

The statement of faith is essentially a [philosophical assertion](philosophy.md) of all aspects that unite your church together.

- It can be long or short, but it *will* be [controversial](people-conflicts-christian-1_why.md), no matter what ([Matthew 10:34-36](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/10.htm)).
- Generally, the more details, the more controversial, but the more likelihood you'll find like-minded believers joining your church (if any).

The [sacraments and rituals](mgmt-church-worship-rituals.md) directly flow from the creeds and catechisms you choose to adopt.

You can draw from a wide variety of creeds and catechisms for inspiration.

## Implicit meaning

All Christian tradition older than 20 years is simply how the Church had adopted their culture of origin from the *past*.

- [The Catholic tradition](history-church.md) is how Europe combined with Christianity after the Roman Empire fell.
- [The Protestant traditions](https://theologos.site/the-west/) are derived components that mix modern thought with both Catholic tradition and anti-Catholic sentiment.
- Most modern (and any future) Christian tradition is assembled on a Protestant framework, but with *very* [modern views](trends.md).
- Your [culture](people-culture.md) will vary on practicing church, and no church model is ideal because each person [derives meaning](meaning.md) differently.

## Common failures

Weekly church gatherings tend to partially alienate the [motivational gifts](spiritual-gifts.md) from serving in a broader capacity:

- Encouragement will find the most satisfaction in the uplifting music and good news in the announcements.
- Serving will be satisfied when they see opportunities to help in the ministry's operations.
- Giving will be satisfied in supporting the group at large.
- Teaching will be most satisfied with the preacher's study and additional Bible studies, or a teaching role for themselves.
- Prophecy will be satisfied by the preacher speaking difficult truths.
- Mercy won't find any satisfaction in the main service, but often through off-topic discussions about personal issues during meetings.
- Administration finds satisfaction when they see everything well-organized, or if they're free to run a ministry.
- Faith will usually never find satisfaction outside of stories of missionaries, church plants, or new ministry opportunities.

One combined solution can accommodate *every* member's individual needs:

1. The weekly meeting is encouraged as a pick-and-choose experience:
   - Unless they're conducting it, each person can meet for any particular element of the service.
   - There's no requirement for them to attend the *entire* service.
2. Preaching and teaching *never* expand beyond crowds of ~150 people.
   - Above that point, people have [issues personally connecting](groups-small.md).
3. When sub-leaders are appointed to preach and teach, each group has its own autonomy.
   - If anyone discovers new [ideas](trends.md), *everyone* hears about them, even if they're bad.
   - Leaders are responsible to publicly address their decisions with the entire gathering.
4. If anyone has a divergent opinion from the group's [culture](people-culture.md), and it's more personal preference than morality, the leadership will be fully open to any changes from it.
   - This shoudl include sending a significant minority with that person to pursue other unrelated ministries.

## Denominational distinctions

Conformity to Christ is conforming to what the Holy Spirit dictates.

- Beyond [Scripture](bible.md), this will be *highly* personal, and won't apply to others.
- However, Jesus promised [conflict](people-conflicts-christian-1_why.md) was inevitable ([Matthew 10:34-39](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/10.htm)).

If you pull *anything* from existing denominations, you'll also often draw their added criticism because it was inspired from them.

- Many Protestants have generational [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) from their division with the Catholic Church, so they'll likely condemn any Catholic rituals as religiousness.
- Most Catholics believe their rituals *are* part of the journey to salvation (instead of a response that accompanies it) so to them removing the rituals is a lesser version of their faith or outright wrong.
- Big Eva has tailored the rituals and sacraments to maximize [engagement and appeal](marketing.md), but requires minimal involvement or requirement to change.

Expect [conflicts](people-conflicts-christian-1_why.md) with other Christians.

- God designed all good things, and using a good thing in its place with Him as part of it is just as spiritual as any long-standing traditions or denominations.
- Even extremely *non*-religious domains (e.g., [science](science.md), [engineering](engineering.md)) can be holy if Christ is at the center of it.
- By implication, this means all secular things can be holy, and that is [taboo](morality-taboo.md) among most Christians, even though the Bible indicates it clearly ([1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/8.htm)).

## Growth

Most pastors are territorial, but they sin when they do.

- God appoints each person to a job, and He grants the increase ([1 Corinthians 3:5-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/3.htm)).
- His Church is a vast variety of [cultures](people-culture.md) and [groups](groups-small.md), and anything you do is merely one of those groups.
- [Every denomination](history-church.md) is simply the result of [conflicts with other denominations](people-conflicts-christian-1_why.md), and [none of them will last indefinitely](https://theologos.site/millennium/).

### Organizational hierarchy

Most churches assemble as a hierarchy:

- The nonbelievers and Christians from other denominations are at the bottom.
- Once someone regularly attends, they're considered to be a more significant part of the ministry.
- In many denominations, someone can go through a set of rituals to become a member.
  - Membership might be a single class, or may have more elaborate public rituals involved.
- Lay-leadership are people who volunteer to assist in the church's activities.
  - Sometimes they're picked as the need arises, other times they're formally appointed or voted in.
- Pastors/elders are formalized roles ordained by the top-ranking leadership.
- At the top, there is typically a pastor/elder or a board of elders.
  - This individual or group dictates what the church will do on a grand scale.
- Above the ministry, the denomination may have further leadership and requirements.
  - Most denominations require adherence to a specific set of [theological values](theology.md).
  - In the Catholic denominations, many priests are subordinate to further leadership (e.g., bishops, cardinals).
  - Some denominations (e.g., Calvary Chapel) require giving all finances to a central control, and are then disbursed the funds according to need.

However, the Bible itself only refers to appointing "elders" and "deacons".

- In other words, there's not much regarding the hierarchy of [trust](trust.md) beyond whether someone is fit to [lead](spiritual-discipleship.md).
- The greatest spiritual leader will have [endured persecution](hardship-persecution-church.md) in Jesus' name.

Deductively, every church will have 3 different classifications of "believer" ([Matthew 7:22-23](https://biblehub.com/matthew/7.htm) and [13:24-30](https://biblehub.com/matthew/13.htm), [1 Corinthians 3:10-15](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3.htm)):

1. People devoted and on fire for the Lord, with apparent [spiritual fruits](identity.md) in their life.
2. People doing good things, but with selfish intent in *everything* they do, who will still enter God's kingdom.
3. People who publicly look good, and have done good things, but don't know Jesus personally, and will not enter His kingdom.

A church starts engaging in [cult-like behavior](culture-cults.md) when it starts mandating members attend something to achieve some form of status.

- In a culturally diverse geographical region, the vast range of lifestyles a person can have will mean they *can't* attend all the events even if they wanted to.
- Church leaders who survive on donations often underestimate how much working a full-time job can consume most of a week.

### Growth models

There are a few major models for churches built around routine meetings.

The **Traditional** model starts in a house, then transitions to a building.

- Usually minded to a specific [cultural group](people-culture.md) with a narrow vision for who they'll reach.
- Traditional churches often have a strong passion for [evangelism](evangelism.md).
- It balances resources well, and most people find them familiar.
- The lack of demographic diversity, however, often fosters complacency.

The **Launch Big** model is a high-cost growth strategy that reflects secular non-profit organizations.

- It has a consumerist, atheist angle that attracts non-believers.
- Launch Big churches give a verbal [Gospel](jesus-gospel.md) presentation that can potentially reach tens of thousands of people at once.
- Though it can grow enormous, it doesn't usually send many missionaries or church plants.
- They often create a secular culture and usually have weak [discipleship](spiritual-discipleship.md).

The **Organic House Church** model focuses on minimalism and removing extra elements of services.

- The original model expressed in the Bible ([Acts 2:46](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/act.2.46)).
- Since they usually don't advertise and stay small, most people are unaware of this model.
- While they attract self-starters who network to find them, they leave most of the Body oblivious.
- Organic House Churches keep an intimate connection with all the members, so everyone is motivated to serve each other.
- Unfortunately, the leadership is usually held unaccountable for [sins](morality-sins.md) and the [culture](people-culture.md) can often turn rebellious against larger churches.

The **Multi-Site/Satellite** model can split and reproduce into a separate campus at any time after reaching specific milestones.

- A network of churches creates an enormous pool of resources the whole string of churches can use.
- Unfortunately, they're often held together by a leader's personality, which creates a homogenous, fake culture if the plant isn't sufficiently [remixed](mind-creativity.md) in its [destination culture](people-culture.md).

The **Missional Incarnate** model is like the Traditional model, but stays smaller to focus on relationships.

- Missional Incarnate is a hybrid of Traditional and Organic House churches.
- The culture focuses on [discipleship](spiritual-discipleship.md) in its surrounding community, so they're constantly moving and shifting to environmental needs.
- While members keep room for outside growth, they encourage each other to get involved.

### Logistics

The simplicity and diversity of a church decays at least somewhat as soon as it buys real estate:

1. The extra overhead costs will require a minimum amount of contribution to pay the mortgage and utilities.
2. Eventually, some members would prefer a partition for crying babies.
3. Then, some members will want a separate children's ministry to keep the children from disrupting the service.
4. Then, that children's church will expand to a middle/high school group.
5. Over time, it'll start segmenting into other groups (e.g., college, singles, elder groups).
6. By this point, everyone has been demographically siloed and the church is no longer a unified body anymore.

Therefore, the best way to stay healthy is to never exceed 150 people, but preferably never surpass 60.

- At that point, the split should come through an intentional purpose (e.g., church plant, missionary venture, etc.).

### Correctly measuring success

Most measuring conventions create a perverse incentive ([Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law)):

- Attendance metrics motivate flashy, shallow performances to increase attendance.
- Conversion metrics motivate shallow presentations and high-pressure [sales pitches](marketing.md).
- Membership metrics motivates [high-pressure selling](marketing.md) for membership.
- Ministries or event metrics build a frenzy of unproductive activities.
- [Financial](power-types.md) metrics incentivize pushing people to give for the wrong reasons.
- Preparedness metrics (i.e., how "equipped" believers are) will often degenerate into a [bureaucratic system](mgmt-badsystems.md) of attending classes.

Some of the best measurements are *still* difficult to define:

- Measuring member satisfaction is difficult to trace and doesn't distinguish between legitimate issues and individual sins.
- Measuring spiritual growth is impossible because [religious people can imitate it](people-lying.md).
- Measuring fulfilled ministry needs often requires people to discuss things God told them to stay silent on.

However, missionary satisfaction and church plant success are worth tracking.

- Missionaries are the front lines and church plants are the supporting teams for fulfilling Jesus' great commission ([Matthew 28:19](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.28.19)).
- Outside of helping other denominations, missionaries and church plants are *the* most selfless possible ministry activities.
