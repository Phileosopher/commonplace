Higher-order math just uses fractions, NOT division, since division gets messy and vague

When you get into more complex formulas, implied multiplication is treated as higher priority than operators for multiplication. "6 ÷ 2y, y=3" would almost universally be interpreted as 1 even without parenthesis.

This is all a moot point because "÷" is almost never used in higher mathematics because it creates either ambiguity or very messy equations requiring a ton of parentheses. Fractions are used instead. See in this thread even calculators disagreeing on the answer.

Algebra is basically calculations by completing and balancing
