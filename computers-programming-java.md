# The Java programming language

Java was made by a committee, and has *tons* of unnecessary syntax. However, it's still the industry standard for many domains (such as Android apps).

It exists mostly because it's been existing, though it's waned in popularity somewhat now that other languages like Rust have become more powerful and easier to work with.
