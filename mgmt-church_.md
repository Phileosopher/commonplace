God may call you to lead in professional ministry.

The qualifications of elders are *more* severe than general [spiritual mentors](spiritual-discipleship.md) (i.e., "deacons") ([Titus 1:5-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/titus/1.htm), [1 Timothy 3:1-13](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_timothy/3.htm)):

- Has a clean [public reputation](image.md) through established [habits](spiritual-exercises.md) that reinforce their [beliefs](jesus-gospel.md).
- Clear with their [words](language.md), and not [dishonest](people-lying.md).
- Faithful to their [spouse](relationships-3_marriage.md), with their spouse also having a clean public reputation.
- Their [children](parenting-3_teenagers.md) are also believers that haven't been accused of being wasteful or rebellious.
- Slow to anger.
- Free of any [substance abuse](addiction-substances.md).
- Doesn't love power for its own sake, especially [money](power-types.md).
- Soundly [understands](understanding.md) the Bible as he was taught.

No matter *what* you do, prioritize your [family](people-family.md), especially your [wife](relationships-3_marriage.md) and [children](parenting-2_children.md).

- Your children will see your private life more than anyone else you lead, and how you treat them is the most controllable thing you can do for your ministry's [legacy](legacy.md).
- In any ministry, leaders' wives are the most vulnerable because others expect her performance, but don't tend to give her much support.

Don't assume a larger leadership role until you have experience [teaching and mentoring](spiritual-discipleship.md) ([1 Timothy 3:2](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm)).

* * * * *

## God should want it

Carefully evaluate why you want to engage in public ministry.

- The ministry will arise out of a perceived need within the Church ([Acts 6:1-6](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/6.htm)).
- Every inspiration comes from several possible sources:
  - [Your mind](understanding.md)
  - [Others' thoughts](power-influence.md)
  - [God's guidance](god-will.md)
  - [The devil's deceptions](spiritual-warfare-tricks.md)
- Make 100% sure it's God's guidance, since it takes His name in vain to start something in His name ([Exodus 20:7](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm)).
- There are a *lot* of bad reasons to start (or continue) a public ministry:
  - Projected hatred of anyone due to their [sins](morality-sins.md).
  - Desire to create [social change](trends.md) to fight [injustice](morality-justice.md) driven by *any* revenge.
  - Frustration at present Christian leaders who [lead believers wrongly](conflicts-christian.md).
  - [Feedback](power-influence.md) from others for doing well in a ministry setting.
- The reason should *always* be a straightforward desire to [follow God's will](god-will.md) and expand His Kingdom ([Matthew 6:10](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-10.htm)).
  - Ideas from Him are good, honorable, fair, pure, lovely, and reputable ([Philippians 4:8-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/philippians/4.htm)).
  - God doesn't speak vaguely, and He *will* confirm it's His idea ([1 Corinthians 14:33](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm)).
  - When you've been walking with Him for a while, [ideas you arrive at yourself](mind-creativity.md) are often directly inspired by Him.

Before taking the plunge, have the wisdom to count the cost.

- Consider the [relationships](people-4_friends.md) you'll likely gain and lose, your affiliations and [professional network](professionals.md), necessary lifestyle changes, and likely sacrifices.
- Examine the financial shift to your lifestyle.
  1. Think about all your likely future needs and research their costs.
  2. Make a budget that doesn't veer into extreme poverty or opulence.
  3. Even when it doesn't look like enough, ask what you already have (God can use anything).
  4. Consider whom to share your need with (asking money from others is an act of faith).
  5. Give the rest you [can't determine or don't know](unknown.md) to God.
- To serve the spiritual needs of others, you should have your own spiritual state sorted out.
  - While you don't need to [have your shadow completely integrated](personality.md), you should be at least *somewhat* aware of every aspect of your emotional state.
- God uses our inertia far more than our inaction, so look at what you can start now.

Your financial lifestyle will change, but if it's His plan He'll give [meaning](meaning.md) through that change.

- Live with a modest family [budget](money-3_budget.md), *especially* if your lifestyle will be funded by others' donations.
- Keep giving to serve His church as He leads you.
- God has promised He'll give many, many resources for your success by following Him ([Psalm 37](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/37.htm)).

Never live far above *or* below the lifestyles of the people you serve and lead.

- Your car, house, and lifestyle are tools to assist with [guiding people to Jesus](evangelism.md).
- Do *not* compare yourself to others.
- Learn satisfaction with Jesus ruling your finances.

* * * * *

## Ministry types

At its core, a [church](church.md) is simply a gathering of believers ([Matthew 18:20](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm)).

- The only major differences between churches are either [cultural](people-culture.md) or [legal](legal-safety.md).
- This definition is broad enough to include things people often do *not* [understand](understanding.md) to be churches:
  - House gatherings, including group [Bible studies](bible-study.md)
  - Charitable organizations
  - [Media networks](stories-storytellers.md) run by Christians
  - Thrift store chains
  - Christian music concerts
  - Parachurch and ecumenical organizations
- To put it another way, a Christ-like church is simply *any* gathering of people who have performed [Christ-like habits](spiritual-exercises.md) long enough that their shared [habits](habits.md) have [fostered](power-influence.md) a [culture](people-culture.md) to arise from it.
  - That Christian culture will be the hybrid of their culture of origin mixed with a sincere [Christian identity](identity.md).
  - The conventional term for "church" is more accurately a "*worship-based* church".

There are several ways to approach a new ministry venture:

1. Scope out [an articulated plan](entrepreneur-3_plan.md), inspired directly from [secular not-for-profit organizations](mgmt-npo.md), then adapt as things [change](people-changes.md) (a typical approach for [wealthy cultures](https://theologos.site/the-west/)).
2. Trust God entirely for the experience and act directly on what the Holy Spirit says (a typical approach for [persecuted churches](hardship-persecution-church.md)).
3. Attempt to rebuild everything from the ground up (typical for churches less concerned about engaging everyone in a community or with [trust issues](trust.md)).

If you must register your ministry with the government (e.g., 501(c)3 status), you should have a clear scope of what your primary activities are.

- You often have to classify it differently depending on what your primary activity is.
- Many times, it's the distinction between a "ministry-based church" or "church-based ministry", but it's all according to that government's requirements, and is somewhat arbitrary.
- Bear in mind any risks from [persecution](hardship-persecution-church.md) in how you indicate the ministry's activities.

* * * * *

## Leadership skills

Keep [working hard and consistently](success-4_routine.md), even when [you don't see results](success-5_persevering.md).

- Sometimes, for the sake of the ministry, consider [a side job](entrepreneur-4_freelancing.md), *especially* at the beginning ([Acts 18:1-4](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/18.htm)).
- A minister's work never ends, so enjoy any rest, even a few hours.

Get other believers to assist you in diligently [praying and fasting](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md).

Your necessary range of skills will change as you grow.

- At the outset, you will need [an entrepreneur's mindset](entrepreneur-1_why.md) because you're assuming as much or more [risk](safety-riskmgmt.md) as a new for-profit enterprise.
- If your ministry grows, you'll have to adapt [management skills](mgmt-1_why.md).

Don't over-reach your [specialization](jobs-specialization.md).

- If you're experiencing any fatigue, you're probably acting outside the range of your [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md).
- Ask for wisdom on what to do ([James 1:5-6](https://biblehub.com/bsb/james/1.htm)):
  1. Ask a believer more gifted in that capacity who can help you with it instead.
  2. Brainstorm a [creative](mind-creativity-how.md) way around it (e.g., avoiding a [specific project](mgmt-2_projects.md) entirely that's not mission-critical).
  3. If nobody can help, ask Him directly to grant you the power to perform the tasks you're trying to accomplish ([1 Corinthians 14:1](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm)).

Even when the [results](results.md) fail your [expectations](imagination.md), trust He will provide an increase when you need it.

- Your entire reason for working a ministry is for Jesus to be at the center of it.
- God wants your ministry to fit a *specific* group of people He planned out in advance, so don't concern yourself as much with results as what He wants.

* * * * *

## Working with people

Keep your long-term focus on the large-scale impact on the Body of Christ.

- The *first* priority of the Church is to [make disciples](spiritual-discipleship.md) everywhere, with all Christian organizations operating in various capacities to that end.

A spiritual leader's job has 4 components:

1. [Advertise](evangelism.md) and teach [the message of Christ](jesus-gospel.md).
2. Connect people with other people in the global Church.
3. Foster a culture for believers to [Love each other](people-love.md) inside the group as [spiritual family](people-family.md).
4. Perform [discipleship](spiritual-discipleship.md) of their own.

Every ministry leader is responsible to foster a [culture](people-culture.md) for believers to act in the world:

- Show the world's needs, especially the ones members can meet.
- Provoke *everyone* in the group to fulfill those needs.

A healthy ministry should heal and equip believers.

- Christians are susceptible to [false doctrine](conflicts-christian.md) *everywhere* ([1 Timothy 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_timothy/4.htm)).
- We're all in a perpetual [spiritual war with Satan](spiritual-warfare.md) ([James 4:7](https://biblehub.com/james/4-7.htm)).
- Believers experience far more [persecution](hardship-persecution-church.md) than the world would ever admit ([2 Timothy 3:10-13](https://biblehub.com/bsb/2_timothy/3.htm)).

Contrary to popular belief, the ministry system itself will *not* help believers grow.

1. Any ministry will provoke individuals to contribute their efforts to it.
2. Those individuals' efforts are the means of serving the needy.
3. To that end, all ministries should work to perform several possible objectives:
   - Magnify the [influence](power-influence.md) of individuals that demonstrate Christ-like behavior.
   - Give freedom for Christians and seeking non-believers to ask questions, with [mature Christians being able to answer them](spiritual-discipleship.md).
   - Give more opportunities for believers to informally [network](people-4_friends.md) with each other.

Play [political chess](groups-large.md) *very* sparingly.

- When you have [power](power.md), it's *very* easy to misuse it without meaning to.
  - Think of absolutely *every* person who could be harmed by your actions.
  - Sometimes, the wisest decision may involve coercion or deception, but trust God's wisdom for it.
- Using power itself isn't evil, but becomes evil as soon as it's [unloving](people-love.md).
- Leaders can often abuse core group members by forgetting that they're volunteers or have a life outside the ministry.

### *Constantly* communicate

Learn [effective communication](language-speaking.md).

- Your messages must share *both* God's love and His hatred of sin.
- Loving people starts with [respecting them](people-3_boundaries.md) and [their decisions](decisions.md).
- Most ministers must use [public speaking](language-speaking.md) and [conflict management](people-5_conflicts.md) skills multiple times every week.
- Expect *lots* of [written correspondence](language-writing.md).

Any spiritual leadership role conveys the power of Scripture, so [keep reading it](bible-study.md).

- Avoid jargon which alienates people from simple truths.
- Stay focused on Christ and the Gospel, no matter how much your [education](education.md) and [culture](people-culture.md) tell you otherwise ([1 Corinthians 2:2](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm)).

Beyond teaching, you and your wife will be openly mentoring everyone in the [group](groups-large.md) while also fostering [a smaller "core" group](groups-small.md).

Share your ministry's success with the members.

- To inspire members to continue serving, tell stories of [successful](success-1_why.md) missions and ministry work.
- Find the positive, inspiring side of stressful situations and tension.
- At the same time, be realistic, and *never* [lie or embellish](people-lying.md) the stories.

Avoid *any* barriers in communication between leaders and the congregation.

- The congregation should be as much or more involved in the ministry's operations as the leadership.
- Create opportunities for members, especially the [youth](maturity.md), to voice opinions, ideas, and concerns.
- Openly show the state of your ministry's [finances](money-accounting.md).

### Members' demography

Every ministry critically *needs* 4 specific demographics of people involved in running it:

1. Wage earners
2. Missionaries/ministers
3. Poor/needy
4. Manna people

A. Wage earners constitute the majority of a ministry's strength.

- Their careers in other [specializations](jobs-specialization.md) mean they're less involved in daily ministry operations, but will be more free to contribute to needs.
  - Individually, they don't appear to be a significant portion of the ministry, but their contributions are most of the driving force of the ministry's projects.
- Since vocational ministers live off donations, they have a cultural disconnect with wage earners:
  - They frequently overlook wage earners' [financial](money-1_why.md) and [career](jobs-1_why.md) needs.
  - Their increased [education](education.md) in theological/ministry matters frequently provokes them to believe their position is more important.
  - They tend to [distrust](trust.md) when the wage earners want to be more involved in ministry operations beyond donations.
- Ask them for funds without any pressure.
  - Tell them to ask God themselves about meeting the available needs.
  - Describe the events as they actually are right now, without embellishment.
  - Clearly articulate [what you want to see](power-influence.md), and how their donation is a means to that end.
- *Never* appeal to [the sin condition](morality-sins.md) through greed, fear, or donors' pride.
  - If you want to give them recognition, do *not* announce it to them beforehand.
- Appealing to guilt or pity *does* get money, but it invalidates any blessings God could have given them.
  - Further, while they'll contribute more, they'll grow to resent your ministry when they learn [healthy boundaries](people-boundaries.md) later.

B. Missionaries/ministers are financed, at least partly, by others' donations.

- Their income sources vary wildly from one to the next.
- However, they typically receive funding through a few specific routes:
  1. Annual salary, drawn from a collective ministry offering.
  2. Volunteer donations from the part-time work of making requests through calls, emails, and letters.
  3. Specific missionary/parachurch organizations that provide partial or full aid.
  4. Some of them have at least part-time day jobs ([Acts 20:33-35](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/20.htm)).

C. The poor/needy will *always* be with us ([Matthew 26:11](https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-11.htm)).

- Sometimes they're under [hardship](hardship.md) they couldn't have prevented, and other times they're suffering [consequences](results.md) of their [decisions](decisions.md).
  - How you treat them shows your priorities ([Matthew 25:31-40](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25.htm)).
  - While helping the poor against your better judgment can be challenging, God will still honor it.
- They need love and nurturing care, even if they brought the entire experience on themselves.
  - All throughout the Bible, God shows *tremendous* patience, and we are responsible to do the same ([Luke 13:34](https://biblehub.com/luke/13-34.htm)).
  - Jesus commands us to give to the poor, regardless of how they became poor ([Matthew 5:42](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-42.htm)).
  - We should only withhold aid to help *other* needy people, never to punish them.
- At the same time, we're also responsible to be wise with what we have.
  - If a minister isn't careful, their money will advance foolishness.

1. Ask if they have a crisis.
   - A genuine crisis means that any inaction will create severe adverse consequences.
   - If it's not a crisis, that person has time to act on their own.
2. Note how much they claim personal responsibility for their crisis.
   - Every crisis is a mixture of bad decisions and unfortunate circumstances.
3. Examine how much they can legitimately help themselves.
   - If they *can* help themselves, even partially, [empower](power-types.md) them to support themselves.
   - If possible, give them the means to work for themselves.
4. Never do for people what they can do for themselves!
   - It takes away from others who may need your help.
   - You rob them of the [meaning](meaning.md) they would have found through solving their own problems.
5. If helping them isn't within your power, ask their permission to share the need and publicly ask the ministry for help.
   - The Body of Christ needs giving opportunities to grow.
   - Ironically, as ministries grow larger they tend to give fewer public requests for help.
6. Prepare for backlash if you set *any* boundaries.
   - Professional beggars are very skilled at [influencing others](power-influence.md) to feel guilt and pity.
   - If you need, [stay legally safe](legal-safety.md) with a system that formally records the conversation involving their request.

D. God directly supplies some "manna people" without any reasonable explanation.

- These people receive God's daily provision from strange places.
  - Witnessing their lifestyle is a legitimately entertaining experience.
- God rarely gives without others' involvement because He wants to show how giving is better than receiving.
  - He wants members to trust each other and the Holy Spirit to heal and grow together.

* * * * *

## Working with things

Discipline yourself about money matters.

1. Don't worry about money issues, but [be aware of them](money-1_why.md).
2. [Set priorities](money-3_budget.md) with money you have and might have.
3. Diligently and responsibly take care of your needs first ([1 Timothy 5:17-18](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_timothy/5.htm), [2 Timothy 2:6](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm)).
4. [Invest money](money-investing.md) instead of hoarding it to see it grow character and God's kingdom.

Stay on top of any [logistical needs](logistics.md) to avoid wasting time for others or incurring extra costs.

Stay [legally safe](legal-safety.md) to make [persecution](hardship-persecution-church.md) more difficult for the government to justify.

- Unless they're asking for the names of each member, register and file your organization if the government expects it.
- Avoid *any* potentially questionable practices that don't honor the spirit of the law (e.g., tax evasion with cash receipts).
  - Remember that God rules us all, and He will repay any mistreatment of you if *you* were doing the right thing ([1 Peter 2:11-19](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_peter/2.htm)).
- Members of your organization *might* commit [sins](morality-sins.md) that are [culturally taboo](morality-taboo.md), so clearly establish a non-disparagement clause on any [contracts](people-contracts.md) with workers.
- Avoid complete submission to the authorities, since we still must use wisdom against [evil](morality-evil.md) ([Matthew 10:16](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm)).

Running a ministry requires the same [logistics](logistics.md) as most other [large organizations](groups-large.md):

- People who direct the crowds like ushers or greeters.
- [Technology](technology.md) managers like media and IT professionals.
- [Public speakers](language-speaking.md) to present God's message and share truths.
- Musicians and performers to lead everyone in group worship music.
- Recordkeepers like accountants and office workers.

### Distributing content

Distribute all public content with [open licensing](legal-ip.md).

- There is absolutely zero spiritual benefit in maintaining full copyright on everything you create.
  - If you wish to make money on a creative product, make that explicitly clear and avoid letting the for-profit motives interfere with your ministry's purposes.
- To prevent future licensing issues, release all documents as Creative Commons.
  - The [secular open-source community](legal-ip-floss.md) brings Christians to open shame with the generosity they give away their content.
- If you have overhead and distribution costs the organization can't easily absorb, give a "suggested donation" amount that's about twice the expected cost to manufacture.

Publicly show your financial statements.

- While it's often required by law, showing where the money goes generates trust with the donors and reduces risks of corruption with finances.
- Since donors *will* ask, keep close track as it happens on where the money goes.
- However, you will need to obfuscate any aspects where [persecution](hardship-persecution-church.md) may be a risk (e.g., distributing illegal Bibles).

* * * * *

## Conflicts

After becoming established, most leaders tend to [distrust](trust.md) new ideas.

- At that point, they've forgotten their role as a messenger and curator and see themselves as an authority on a subject.
- However, what they often find uncomfortable is a matter of personal preference or [theological semantics](theology.md).
- When leaders distrust, they inspire the entire group to become distrustful.
  - Unless it's [heresy](conflicts-christian.md), rejecting people with different viewpoints begins precedent that can lead to a [cult-like culture](culture-cults.md).

Healthy [conflict management](conflicts-christian.md) means you may have to exile some people from a group.

- [Disciplinary action in the Church](conflicts-christian.md) is very clear, and leads to 4 possible outcomes ([Matthew 18:15-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/18.htm)):
  1. Reconciliation among everyone in spirit and truth, which should be the ultimate aim ([John 4:24](https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm)).
  2. The leader is ejected/defrocked from their formal ministry status, which strengthens the Body through a public lesson on how [sinful behaviors](morality-sins.md) and [vices](addiction-substances.md) will destroy us.
  3. The leader is ejected/defrocked, but they *didn't* sin, meaning 50-70% of the group will leave with that leader.
  4. The situation was complicated, and the leader has gained allies, and 10-30% of the group will leave or back away from involvement in the church.
- If the heresy is bad enough, know ahead of time how to deal with it, and be prepared to create [a church split](history-church.md) if necessary.
  - The risks of social pushback mean most churches do *not* have plans in place on how to exile their members.
  - At the same time, some churches veer into the other extreme and exile people over [stupid conflicts](conflicts-christian.md).

Make sure you demarcate between God's opinion and yours.

- It's inevitable that your opinion will differ from God's, since [you don't see exactly as He sees](https://theologos.site/god-sight/).
- When you're a leader, people *will* weigh your opinion as having relevance, irrespective of whether God officially holds it or not.
- However, speaking on behalf of God about something He didn't overtly say is a very subtle form of [heresy](conflicts-christian.md), and can get you in trouble long-term.

At any time, be prepared to step down.

- You *should* step down from your role and release it to someone else for *any* of the following reasons:
  - Your family needs you.
  - Your children have shown themselves as rebellious.
  - You've become absolutely exhausted in your ministry role.
  - You've become [an addict](addiction.md).
  - You've found out you practice at least some [heresy](conflicts-christian.md).
- It may seem like you're still doing God's work, but you're sabotaging His plans when you do.
  - If you're not acting out of love, you're wasting your time ([1 Corinthians 13:1-3](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm)).
  - If you feel compelled to do it, it might just be a [habit](habits.md).
  - Even when we persevere indefinitely, it's our responsibility near the end of our lives to [pass the role on to others](legacy.md) ([2 Timothy 4](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/2ti.4)).

* * * * *

## Growth

Ministries [scale](jobs-specialization.md) like any other [secular organization](groups-large.md).

- They grow through an exponential pattern because each person is drawing from their existing social networks from before their involvement in that ministry.
- A two-minute once-a-month task can slowly adapt to a full-time job for one person.

Never try growing faster than [God has planned](god-will.md).

- The easiest, and most [unethical](morality.md), way to grow is by [generating fake hype](marketing.md) to create a nucleus of sincere followers.
- If you create many followers with a little [deception](image-distortion.md), it's not reasonable to assume He will be proud of your work, irrespective of the [results](results.md) it created ([Matthew 25:1-23](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/25.htm)).

### Social effects

Generally, a ministry loses its personal connection at around 60 members.

- Beyond that point, they will either segment into separate groups or the entire ministry model must adapt by splitting apart into autonomous entities.

If there isn't an intentional split, the most [influential](power-influence.md) members of a ministry will form into a core group.

- Core group members submit themselves under ministry leaders who lead by example, or they become their *own* spiritual leader elsewhere.
- Your core group are the only people who you can trust to be following Jesus, and they determine how much actual ministry service you can do.

Once a ministry has a core group, most leaders have *major* trust issues with "outsiders".

- They're not trusting the [unknown](unknown.md) that God requires them to accept.
- When they stop accepting new ideas and new believers into necessary roles, the ministry will start to decline.

### Logistics

Have a plan for your ministry outgrowing its venue.

- The Bible doesn't give much guidance on how to manage growth.
- Though you must trust God, not planning becomes management crisis through intentional ignorance.

Most conventional ministries move into progressively larger buildings.

- Moving into a larger building has risks:
  - Members (especially new ones) usually experience the ministry more impersonally.
  - As membership grows, leaders must learn new skills to adapt.
  - Scaling systems together in one building can stifle God's work.
- Growing together also has benefits:
  - Large ministry events are easier to coordinate.
  - The whole group can easily work together on ministries.
  - Leaders can thoroughly and quickly manage large-scale conflicts.

Some ministries split when their venue gets too small.

- Splitting has risks:
  - Restructuring the organization often has intense challenges and often causes permanent divisions.
  - Distributed systems always have points of potential failure.
  - Large-scale conflicts often lead to bitter, permanent divisions.
- Splitting off has profound benefits:
  - The ministry stays personal for every single member.
  - It prolongs staying small, which avoids the challenges from large organizations.
  - The added service variety lets the ministry reach more individuals.

### Bylaws & rules

Typically, once any ministry grows beyond a few dozen people, it'll need some bylaws to clarify the [rules](rules.md) for how to do everything.

A ministry's [formalized documentation](people-contracts.md) represents its [moral stance](morality.md).

- Take your rules *very* seriously, since God will hold you accountable for it ([Luke 17:1-2](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/17.htm)).
- *Never* accept or condone [sins](morality-sins.md), and *never* condemn loving actions or [Christlike behavior](spiritual-exercises.md).

* * * * *

## Enduring hardship

Like believers, ministries *need* hardship to grow.

Because we don't usually like discomfort or risk, the non-persecuted Church is often at risk for complacency.

- In countries with almost no persecution, most congregations are filled with moralistic non-believers.
- God lets conveniences occasionally fail to help His Body remember why they gather.
- A healthy ministry should make non-believers feel a distinct type of discomfort (John 13:35).

### Needs vs. wants

Draw a clear line between needs and conveniences.

Needs are whatever Scripture commands and necessary for the Church to operate.

- Music that sings praise to the Lord ([Psalm 33:1-13](https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/33.htm)).
- In-reach - Teaching or [discipleship](spiritual-discipleship.md) through preaching and [Bible study](bible-study.md) ([Titus 2:7-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/titus/2.htm)).
- Outreach - Opportunities for [evangelism](evangelism.md) and other ministries, sending missionaries and ministers, and minister elections.
  - In most conventional churches, this is the public weekly congregation.
- Communion/ Eucharist, public baptisms, marriages, and funerals.
- [Prayer](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md) to God, whether organization-run or with the core group.
  - Since prayer is a private experience, Scripture doesn't outline anything on prayer groups, but should always come as an overflow of desire.
- A [communication network](people-conversation.md), which could be formal (e.g., newsletter) or informal (e.g., sewing circle).

Conveniences have benefits but can sometimes impede the ministry's [purpose](purpose.md).

- Some conveniences simplify ministry operations:
  - Rooms for nursing mothers
  - Grade school and college ministries, separate Bible studies for specific age groups or demographics.
  - Contact cards and data collection.
  - Consistent weekly location in the same venue.
  - [Technology](technology.md) to show worship music, videos or ice-breaker content.
  - Advertisements about where and when everyone meets, a website as a hub of information, and signage that indicates locations.
- Some conveniences make the experience more pleasant:
  - Climate-controlled room, comfortable seats, interior design, and decoration.
  - Musical instruments and audio amplification [technology](technology.md).
  - Slideshow for lyrics and announcements, elaborate lighting.
- Some practices try to speed up conversions to Christianity and fellowship:
  - A few minutes to greet neighboring attendees or someone at the door greeting everyone.
  - Altar calls or in-service evangelistic efforts.
    - The original persecuted Church in Acts couldn't afford to let non-believers join their worship services.

### Leadership needs

More than anything, the most significant risk to the Church is leaven, or religiosity ([Matthew 16:11](https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-11.htm)).

- Religious thinking is a type of inward [bureaucracy](bureaucracy.md) that separates our [image](image.md) from [reality](reality.md).
- Without that authentic connection to reality around us, we have no hope of connecting our unseen [souls](humanity-christian.md) to an unseen [God](god.md).

It's far too common for members of a ministry community to fall into an unhealthy group pattern:

1. They're a volunteer or part-time worker for the group.
2. They fail at whatever external workplace environment they were in.
3. After a lapse in gainful employment, they find some sort of meaning out of a form of a religiousness.
4. They eventually come to believe that their other failures are because God is calling them to professional ministry.
5. They pursue a [Bible college degree](education.md), then become a sub-leader within a ministry capacity.
6. When other believers depend on them, they won't have [integrated their shadow](personality.md) far enough to provide spiritual guidance to them.
   - On occasion, they'll build a [church plant](mgmt-church-plant.md), but it'll look the same as its parent church because they're simply following what other people did instead of legitimately consulting God for help.

Poorly appointing leaders can create *tremendous* problems:

- If someone has a poor public reputation in a [specialization](jobs-specialization.md) beyond their church, they're in direct violation of Titus 1.
  - Formal leaders are [symbols](symbols.md) of their organization's [values](values.md), and they're *far* more responsible to represent the eternal virtues of Christ than anyone else.
- While it may seem unkind, it can protect them from a harsher punishment ([James 3:1](https://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm)).
  - It also protects everyone *else* who would otherwise have been harmed by their mismanagement of the truth.
- In short, not saying "no" to bad leadership candidates is a sin by enabling the Pharisees' leaven.

To find a good leader, look for qualities that define [*any* good leader](mgmt-1_why.md), combined with spiritual strength:

- They have experience with [direct hardship](hardship.md).
- They have joy and peace about [unknown possibilities](unknown.md).
- Even when under duress, they're at least *somewhat* [loving](people-love.md) and compassionate.

For any leader, ask God what He wants you to do.

- He won't mislead, and will make it *abundantly* clear who to appoint.
- If He doesn't say, it may be wise to rethink whether that leadership position is even [part of His plan](god-will.md) anymore.

Each leader needs plenty of [one-on-one time](spiritual-discipleship.md).

- The complexities of [teaching](education.md) a new leader can't be scaled to a classroom.
- Without that personal time, most new leaders will learn to "fake it 'til you make it", which creates religiousness and harms the Body worse than if they hadn't been taught.

### Financial struggles

Financial problems remind us of our limits, and the need for us to trust others.

Check your heart to make sure *you're* not [sinning or disobeying God](morality-sins.md).

- You might be reaping past sins or choices.
- Even if you can't find any sins, you might be too independent or conceited.

If the group is financially struggling for no apparent reason, check whether anyone in the group is sinning.

- God only provides for us when we obey Him.
- God wants us to be dependent on Him and interdependent with each other, *not* autonomous.

Make God more important than things.

- Materialism creeps in slowly.
- Observe whether you're more concerned with meeting needs or learning what God wants to teach you.
- Stay grateful and content for God's provision.
- Heaven's treasures are our relationships and what God teaches us.

Live by faith, not presumption.

- Stay in touch with God's presence and power.
- Observe how you're [faithful](understanding-certainty.md) with small things.
  - God gives us the responsibility for small things before big things.
- Give any [fears](mind-feelings-fear.md) about the [future](imagination.md) to Him.
- Ask God to supply your needs, even the smallest ones.
  - Look at God, not people, to answer those needs.

Since borrowing isn't ideal, only borrow with wisdom.

- Only borrow what you can reasonably expect to repay.
- Get items that have legitimate resale value to pay back your debt if you can't meet your obligations.

Consistently and regularly tithe your money.

- Don't tithe where it indirectly helps your ministry.
- Generously give beyond your tithing.

### Honor *all* the motivational gifts

A ministry won't function if the leaders don't respect the congregation's talents and [motivational gifts](spiritual-gifts.md).

Little or no teaching makes the ministry theologically vague:

- The ministry will dismiss strong doctrine as unloving or no longer relevant.
- Poor teachers won't give structure for members to [change](people-changes.md) and will foster complacency.
- Thoroughly study Scripture and provoke leaders to [study their Bible](bible-study.md) in-depth.

Little or no prophecy/declaration shifts the focus to good feelings and happiness:

- [Love](people-love.md) will only communicate as sentimental affection without considering others' long-term best interests.
- The ministry will often [look](image.md) loving, but none of the members will [change](people-changes.md) much, even while they're increasing [understanding](understanding.md).
- While the Church will do good works, the community won't notice because it lacks Christ's boldness and audacity.
- Invite more bold speakers to teach the congregation and discuss controversial issues.

Little or no encouragement/exhortation makes a ministry legalistic:

- The community will compel people to religious action and not consider God's grace.
- The ministry will become overly systematic and rigid to gain God's approval.
- Teach *much* more about God's grace and love and show by example with [authentic interpersonal skills](people-3_boundaries.md).

Little or no ruling/administration creates a chaotic mess of people that barely resembles a ministry:

- The community will fail to form a cohesive structure and won't organize well.
- Expect plenty of passion with little to no action.
- Give more responsibility to organizationally-minded people and consider more full-time staff positions.

Little or no serving fills a ministry with plenty of leaders and few volunteers:

- Most of the leaders will be overworked and dread plans, ideas, strategies, and [prayer meetings](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md).
- While the ministry will have many programs, they'll be constantly begging for volunteers.
- Emphasize the importance of serving and start ministry-wide volunteer events.

Little or no giving creates a ministry with a constant resource shortage:

- Because very few people will give freely, the ministry will constantly ask for money and donations.
- Over time, ministries without enough donors will become stingy about new programs and resistant to the Holy Spirit's prompts to serve.
- Inform the entire congregation about *specific* needs for *specific* people or circumstances.

Little or no mercy will make a harsh, callous ministry:

- The unloving community will reject first-time attendees and people in positions of weakness.
- Because of its disconnect with strangers, the group will stop growing.
- Expose the congregation to extreme suffering in the surrounding region.

Little or no faith will make a ministry reluctant to hear God's will:

- New programs will become rare because new ideas get assaulted by benefit-cost analysis and risk assessments.
- The only growth will come through attracting non-believers who like the comfortable atmosphere.
- [Pray](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md) for guidance and assume new risks that might backfire if God doesn't provide.

If the ministry has more than two of the above issues from deficient motivational gifts, it might not have enough hardship.

- Hardship brings out character and hope for groups *and* individuals ([Romans 5:3-5](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/5.htm)).
- In the absence of hardship, every ministry becomes a [dysfunctional system](mgmt-badsystems.md).
- Pray for God to bring hardship for spiritual growth and ask trustworthy leaders to do the same.

Watch for how believers' constant sin condition affects the group:

- If you want to address problems, be specific and avoid vague statements that apply to nobody.
- The Church should transform the world more than the world can change it.
- Magnify Christ more than condemning the world's actions.
  - Condemning trends without a legitimate moral cause will shut off opportunities for the Gospel.
- Focusing on the [end times](jesus-returns.md) and the geopolitical circumstances has no spiritual gain.
  - When you bring up the world, show how our lives should differ from its culture.
  - The purpose of prophecy is to inspire us, not create present anxiety ([Revelation 22:16-17](https://biblehub.com/bsb/revelation/22.htm)).
  - Focus steadfastly on [what's coming long-term](https://theologos.site/millennium/).

## Leaving leadership

At some point, you *will* need to step down from leadership:

1. At some point, your particular [gifting](spiritual-gifts.md) may have run its course.
2. It's not uncommon to experience burnout, and it will become a spiritual risk to pursue farther ([2 Timothy 2:3-7](https://biblehub.com/bsb/2_timothy/2.htm)).
3. An unknown [sin](morality-sins.md) (or its consequence) may have corrupted any further good you can perform in that role.
4. The ministry may have grown far enough that it needs to diverge into specific [purposes](purpose.md).
5. Eventually, you will be [too old](legacy.md) to maintain the ministry as needed.

If it's God ministry, He'll bring new leadership or give guidance on what to do with the ministry.

- In a similar mode to [parenting](parenting-3_teenagers.md), how we hand off ministry is the final test of our trust in God.
- Often, the hardship we experience (see above) is His efforts to separate us from any idolatry we may have within the work.

When someone else takes over, they *will* adapt the ministry differently than you had.

God appoints everything in its time, and we will suffer if we're given more time to see how things may unwind ([2 Kings 20](https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20.htm)).

* * * * *



Technically, *all* groups of people serving in a ministry capacity are a "church".

- However, while [society](trends.md) and [technology](technology.md) has moved around quite a bit, most of the *worship-based* Church uses [a model that hasn't changed much in over 1,500 years](history-church.md).

From the exterior, it *looks* different, but those differences are largely cosmetic.

- Most Christian churches are conducting the exact same worship of Jesus, though the emotional thrust of the worship will vary dramatically.

The entire convergence on this page is *not* precise, but accurate-enough.

- It's important to note that the *order* of most rituals move around constantly.
- Denominations have been split over relatively minor aspects like placement of elements and choice of music.
- While the Catholic Church suppresses *all* dissent, Protestantism has a vast and immeasurable range of permutations to every single rite.

* * * * *

## How rituals/sacraments matter

Most of the conventions that make a "typical" church are borrowed from a few source traditions:

1. The Hebrew temple had many traditions established (many of them from [Levitical law](https://biblehub.com/bsb/leviticus/1.htm)).
2. After the Temple fell in [2 Kings 24:10-14](https://biblehub.com/bsb/2_kings/24.htm), the Hebrew people maintained their worship by adapting the rituals for synagogue "mini-Temples", which included many rituals *not* in Hebrew law.
3. New followers of Christ [imitated synagogue tradition](history-church.md) (mostly) and added their own adaptations.
4. As Gentiles arrived, some traditions were removed or permuted to accommodate non-Hebrews.
5. By approximately 200 AD, the Catholic Church later codified and standardized those traditions.
6. Within a few centuries, the Catholic traditions were practically the law, and the cultural assimilation meant pagan rituals merged into the practice.
7. Starting in 1517, the Protestant Church *removed* many of those traditions, but didn't add many.

The [Bible](bible.md) itself only has a few verses that indicate daily details on how to run a church:

- *Some* sacraments (i.e., communion/Eucharist and baptism), though on a more personal level and without many details.
- Specific qualifications necessary within people you wish to appoint as [leaders](mgmt-church.md).
- Almost every other Bible verse about the church are simply [patterned expansions](symbols.md) into a [corporate culture](groups-small.md) from living among [family and friends](people-family.md).

However, across a few thousand years, the Church *has* had some good ideas.

- Those ideas may or may not be good, and they're not necessary to run a church.
- The things you pick-and-choose should conform to [how that congregation is gifted](spiritual-gifts.md) and [how God designed them](identity.md).

While Christian rituals are *very* heavily inspired by Jewish and pagan tradition, the [redemption in Christ](jesus-gospel.md) makes the entire experience direct into a different form towards the [unknown](unknown.md).

- Further, *how* the rituals are performed can create a dramatic difference in how the congregants interpret it.

Each denomination derives a certain form of [meaning](meaning.md) over rituals by *their* interpretation.

- Over the centuries, many of the rituals have been expanded *far* beyond the Bible, and the biblical basis is either [nonexistent](theology-solae.md) or only partly applicable.

To that end, this is an attempt to indicate all the ways you *could* do church.

- You can, however, apply any Bible verses about living well on an individual level to make new rituals and sacraments, which will likely spin into [a different denomination](history-church.md) over time.
- A church should develop its own creativity in discovering new ways to live more like Christ ([Hebrews 10:24-25](https://biblehub.com/bsb/hebrews/10.htm)).

Therefore, while most of the essays here use Bible citations, this page doesn't call for an exhaustive listing.

- If a believer has read through the Bible at least once, they should be able to see what the pattern is and why it would make sense.

To make it simpler, there's a clarification legend throughout this body of text:

- R: Roman Catholic tradition
- E: Eastern Orthodox tradition
- P: Protestant tradition preserved from Catholicism
- I: independent tradition outside the Catholic canon, or idea that has been proposed or tried in some churches

None of the following are technically "necessary" for any salvation-based matters.

- The Bible makes it clear that God saves us, not the way we conduct our rituals ([Ephesians 2:8-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/2.htm)).
- Instead, a ritual's purpose is the same as any other [spiritual exercise](spiritual-exercises.md): to create a [habitual rhythm](habits.md) that fosters [virtuous living](morality.md).
- Religious observance also creates a type of [group cohesion](values.md) through a [shared purpose](purpose.md).
- However, *not* everyone works the same way, and [each person must travel their own pathway](https://theologos.site/devotion-chaos/) ([1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/8.htm), [Romans 14:1-12](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/14.htm)).

* * * * *

## Statement of faith

The statement of faith is essentially a [philosophical assertion](philosophy.md) of all aspects that unite your church together.

- It can be long or short, but it *will* be [controversial](conflicts-christian.md), no matter what ([Matthew 10:34-36](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/10.htm)).
- Generally, the more details, the more controversial, but the more likelihood you'll find like-minded believers joining your church (if any).

The sacraments and rituals directly flow from the creeds and catechisms you choose to adopt.

You can draw from a wide variety of creeds and catechisms for inspiration.

* * * * *

## Sacraments

Churches often have [ritual](habits.md) ceremonies, also called sacraments.

- Almost anything that gives God praise is good, even if it's not specified in the Bible.
- It's only natural if the church's sacraments will reflect the good parts of the members' original [culture and traditions](people-culture.md).
- These sacraments may or may not dovetail into the rest of a weekly church service.

### Greetings

Calling each other by familial titles (e.g., brother, sister).

C/E: Deprecated in most uses, but leaders are still referred to as "Father".

P: Typically not used in most denominations except [Pentecostal](history-church.md), except with smaller groups of believers among each other.

### Baptism

A [symbol](symbols.md) of our spiritual baptism in Christ, and commanded by Scripture ([1 Peter 3:21](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm)).

- Water baptism doesn't give salvation, but does show it to the world ([Luke 23:29-43](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/23.htm)).
  - Most churches that baptize will stress the significance of baptism.
- The water can be by immersion or sprinkling.
  - Immersion symbolizes the complete end of one's [identity](identity.md) as part of this world.
  - However, sprinkling can imply that we're imperfect and will still sin (and therefore need [God's continued work](jesus-gospel.md)).

C/E: Baptism is at birth (often with circumcision), or possibly during Confirmation.

- Along with baptism, many Christians borrow from Hebrew tradition and circumcise infants as well.

P: Baptism is only after conversion.

### Confirmation

A public declaration of faith in Christ.

C/E: Confirmation is the completion of the water baptism.

While there's no ritual for Protestants, they honor someone's private prayer to receive Christ ("the Sinner's Prayer"):

- e.g., "Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am very sorry and now want to turn away from my past life toward you. Please forgive me and help me to avoid sinning again. I believe your son Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name, I pray, Amen."

### Eucharist/communion

The elements include a type of bread representing Christ's bodily sacrifice and grape juice or wine to represent covering our sins with His blood.

- Irrespective of its meaning, communion is Jesus' command ([John 6:53-58](https://biblehub.com/bsb/john/6.htm)).

Elements

- C/E: official sacramental bread, made without yeast
  - P: saltine crackers or any bread made without yeast
  - I: standard bread
- C/E: a cup of wine
  - P: individual half-shot glasses of grape juice

Routine

- C: Presentation of the Gifts and Preparation of the Altar
  - The bread and wine are brought in front of the altar to be blessed.
- C: Prayer over the Offerings
- Eucharistic/Communion Prayer
  - C/E: a highly ordered set of multiple prayers and sayings that converts the bread and wine into Jesus' physical body and blood (transubstantiation).
    - The timing of *when* this happens differs between Catholic and Eastern Orthodox.
  - P: a prayer and meditative song.
- C: The Lord's Prayer
  - Reciting the Lord's Prayer ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://www.biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm)).
- C: Sign/Rite of Peace
  - The leader prays for Jesus' peace to fill everywhere.
- Fraction Rite/Lamb of God
  - C: the bread is broken by the leader
  - P: the bread is broken by the people, or passed around pre-broken on a plate
  - I: the people go to the bread and break it off themselves
- Communion
  - C: an acknowledgment that nobody is worthy to receive the gift, then the leader takes it, followed by the people
  - P: a recitation of the Bible verse saying to consume the elements ([Matthew 26:26-28](https://www.biblehub.com/matthew/26.htm))
- C: Prayer after Communion
  - A request that the benefits of the communion will remain active in daily life later.

### Penance/confession

Asking for forgiveness of [sins](morality-sins.md) under Christ's atonement ([James 5:16](https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm)).

C: Confession is performed by a congregant with a church leader.

P: Most don't perform *any* type of confession, but usually imply it can be a prayer conversation with God.

### Marriage

Ceremonies are frequently performed in churches.

- Marriage ceremonies show a man and woman's union symbolizing how Christ will someday unite with the Church ([Ephesians 5:25-27](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/5.htm), [Revelation 19:6-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/revelation/19.htm)).

While all Christians agree with the marriage ceremony, the details vary tremendously.

### Ordination

Appointing new church leaders.

- C: a set of ceremonies and public declaration to commemorate the event.
- P: announcements of the elected vote results.

### Anointing of the Sick

Honors people dying and passing on to the next life.

- Most Western cultures make the loss of life from this earth a grim and dark affair.
- Many Eastern cultures view death as a mixture of sorrow from missing someone and tremendous joy of their spiritual victory and chance to finally see God.

Usually represents as a funeral service, often with a wake service before it.

### Laying on of hands

Giving blessing, healing, or authority with physical contact.

- C: Deprecated for most uses except for confirmation.
- P: [Pentecostals](history-church.md) in particular emphasize its importance.

### The Peace

A 2-3 hour period of time before the Eucharist/communion for believers to [seek reconciliation](people-5_conflicts.md).

Inspired by Jesus' command to leave your gift at the altar and find closure first ([Matthew 5:23-24](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/5.htm)).

P: Only practiced occasionally, if at all.

### Love feasts

Spending time in close fellowship with other believers over a meal.

- While it was originally an informal matter, it became more formalized by the year 200 AD.
- The love feast was historically the original place for Eucharist/communion.

P: Only practiced occasionally, if at all, but often expresses through mid-week Bible studies.

* * * * *

  - P: a leader delivers an [expository](bible-study.md) speech that references Bible verses, then explains how they apply to our lives.
  - I: the people from the audience come up to the stage and give a few words of insight based on the Bible, often taking turns.
    - While many of the laity are *definitely* qualified to give a message, most churches only reserve that power to approved clergy.
- C: Profession of Faith
  - A public declaration of a [creed](church-creeds.md), usually Apostles' or Nicene.
- C: Universal Prayer, aka Prayer of the Faithful

### C. Eucharist/communion

A sacrament involving eating and drinking to [symbolize](symbols.md) Jesus' sacrifice (see above) ([Luke 22:19-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/22.htm)).

- While its basis does vary dramatically, the ritual *must* be distinguished as for believers only.

### D. Concluding rites

A final parting word for people to leave with and take into their lives elsewhere.

Elements

- P: tracts that give a schedule of future church events.

Routine

- Optional announcements
  - C/E: Leader describes the schedule for any upcoming liturgical events.

- If it happens on the same day as the main service, The Peace will be in-between.

P: Practiced on occasion, but typically as a mid-week Bible study.

### Crowd participation

The conformity of Christian culture should reflect the principles God established in the Hebrew law ([1 Corinthians 14:26-40](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/14.htm)).

- Whatever you do, do it peacefully.
- Don't condemn prophecies or tongues, but make sure it's one at a time and builds up the Body.

However, *some* practices are [taboo](morality-taboo.md) according to the Bible.

- When women have questions, they should be silent in the public congregation and ask their husbands at home ([1 Corinthians 14:34-35](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/14.htm)).
  - This doesn't forbid female *teachers*, but individual questions can be very distracting.
- [Sinful](morality-sins.md) behavior should *never* be celebrated or honored ([1 Corinthians 5](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/5.htm)).

* * * * *

## Implicit meaning

All Christian tradition older than 20 years is simply how the Church had adopted their culture of origin from the *past*.

- [The Catholic tradition](history-church.md) is how Europe combined with Christianity after the Roman Empire fell.
- [The Protestant traditions](https://theologos.site/the-west/) are derived components that mix modern thought with both Catholic tradition and anti-Catholic sentiment.
- Most modern (and any future) Christian tradition is assembled on a Protestant framework, but with *very* [modern views](trends.md).
- Your [culture](people-culture.md) will vary on practicing church, and no church model is ideal because each person [derives meaning](meaning.md) differently.

* * * * *

## Common failures

Weekly church gatherings tend to partially alienate the [motivational gifts](spiritual-gifts.md) from serving in a broader capacity:

- Encouragement will find the most satisfaction in the uplifting music and good news in the announcements.
- Serving will be satisfied when they see opportunities to help in the ministry's operations.
- Giving will be satisfied in supporting the group at large.
- Teaching will be most satisfied with the preacher's study and additional Bible studies, or a teaching role for themselves.
- Prophecy will be satisfied by the preacher speaking difficult truths.
- Mercy won't find any satisfaction in the main service, but often through off-topic discussions about personal issues during meetings.
- Administration finds satisfaction when they see everything well-organized, or if they're free to run a ministry.
- Faith will usually never find satisfaction outside of stories of missionaries, church plants, or new ministry opportunities.

One combined solution can accommodate *every* member's individual needs:

1. The weekly meeting is encouraged as a pick-and-choose experience:
   - Unless they're conducting it, each person can meet for any particular element of the service.
   - There's no requirement for them to attend the *entire* service.
2. Preaching and teaching *never* expand beyond crowds of ~150 people.
   - Above that point, people have [issues personally connecting](groups-small.md).
3. When sub-leaders are appointed to preach and teach, each group has its own autonomy.
   - If anyone discovers new [ideas](trends.md), *everyone* hears about them, even if they're bad.
   - Leaders are responsible to publicly address their decisions with the entire gathering.
4. If anyone has a divergent opinion from the group's [culture](people-culture.md), and it's more personal preference than morality, the leadership will be fully open to any changes from it.
   - This shoudl include sending a significant minority with that person to pursue other unrelated ministries.

## Denominational distinctions

Conformity to Christ is conforming to what the Holy Spirit dictates.

- Beyond [Scripture](bible.md), this will be *highly* personal, and won't apply to others.
- However, Jesus promised [conflict](conflicts-christian.md) was inevitable ([Matthew 10:34-39](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/10.htm)).

If you pull *anything* from existing denominations, you'll also often draw their added criticism because it was inspired from them.

- Many Protestants have generational [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) from their division with the Catholic Church, so they'll likely condemn any Catholic rituals as religiousness.
- Most Catholics believe their rituals *are* part of the journey to salvation (instead of a response that accompanies it) so to them removing the rituals is a lesser version of their faith or outright wrong.
- Big Eva has tailored the rituals and sacraments to maximize [engagement and appeal](marketing.md), but requires minimal involvement or requirement to change.

Expect [conflicts](conflicts-christian.md) with other Christians.

- God designed all good things, and using a good thing in its place with Him as part of it is just as spiritual as any long-standing traditions or denominations.
- Even extremely *non*-religious domains (e.g., [science](science.md), [engineering](engineering.md)) can be holy if Christ is at the center of it.
- By implication, this means all secular things can be holy, and that is [taboo](morality-taboo.md) among most Christians, even though the Bible indicates it clearly ([1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/8.htm)).

## Growth

Most pastors are territorial, but they sin when they do.

- God appoints each person to a job, and He grants the increase ([1 Corinthians 3:5-9](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/3.htm)).
- His Church is a vast variety of [cultures](people-culture.md) and [groups](groups-small.md), and anything you do is merely one of those groups.
- [Every denomination](history-church.md) is simply the result of [conflicts with other denominations](conflicts-christian.md), and [none of them will last indefinitely](https://theologos.site/millennium/).

### Organizational hierarchy

Most churches assemble as a hierarchy:

- The nonbelievers and Christians from other denominations are at the bottom.
- Once someone regularly attends, they're considered to be a more significant part of the ministry.
- In many denominations, someone can go through a set of rituals to become a member.
  - Membership might be a single class, or may have more elaborate public rituals involved.
- Lay-leadership are people who volunteer to assist in the church's activities.
  - Sometimes they're picked as the need arises, other times they're formally appointed or voted in.
- Pastors/elders are formalized roles ordained by the top-ranking leadership.
- At the top, there is typically a pastor/elder or a board of elders.
  - This individual or group dictates what the church will do on a grand scale.
- Above the ministry, the denomination may have further leadership and requirements.
  - Most denominations require adherence to a specific set of [theological values](theology.md).
  - In the Catholic denominations, many priests are subordinate to further leadership (e.g., bishops, cardinals).
  - Some denominations (e.g., Calvary Chapel) require giving all finances to a central control, and are then disbursed the funds according to need.

However, the Bible itself only refers to appointing "elders" and "deacons".

- In other words, there's not much regarding the hierarchy of [trust](trust.md) beyond whether someone is fit to [lead](spiritual-discipleship.md).
- The greatest spiritual leader will have [endured persecution](hardship-persecution-church.md) in Jesus' name.

Deductively, every church will have 3 different classifications of "believer" ([Matthew 7:22-23](https://biblehub.com/matthew/7.htm) and [13:24-30](https://biblehub.com/matthew/13.htm), [1 Corinthians 3:10-15](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3.htm)):

1. People devoted and on fire for the Lord, with apparent [spiritual fruits](identity.md) in their life.
2. People doing good things, but with selfish intent in *everything* they do, who will still enter God's kingdom.
3. People who publicly look good, and have done good things, but don't know Jesus personally, and will not enter His kingdom.

A church starts engaging in [cult-like behavior](culture-cults.md) when it starts mandating members attend something to achieve some form of status.

- In a culturally diverse geographical region, the vast range of lifestyles a person can have will mean they *can't* attend all the events even if they wanted to.
- Church leaders who survive on donations often underestimate how much working a full-time job can consume most of a week.

### Growth models

There are a few major models for churches built around routine meetings.

The **Traditional** model starts in a house, then transitions to a building.

- Usually minded to a specific [cultural group](people-culture.md) with a narrow vision for who they'll reach.
- Traditional churches often have a strong passion for [evangelism](evangelism.md).
- It balances resources well, and most people find them familiar.
- The lack of demographic diversity, however, often fosters complacency.

The **Launch Big** model is a high-cost growth strategy that reflects secular non-profit organizations.

- It has a consumerist, atheist angle that attracts non-believers.
- Launch Big churches give a verbal [Gospel](jesus-gospel.md) presentation that can potentially reach tens of thousands of people at once.
- Though it can grow enormous, it doesn't usually send many missionaries or church plants.
- They often create a secular culture and usually have weak [discipleship](spiritual-discipleship.md).

The **Organic House Church** model focuses on minimalism and removing extra elements of services.

- The original model expressed in the Bible ([Acts 2:46](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/act.2.46)).
- Since they usually don't advertise and stay small, most people are unaware of this model.
- While they attract self-starters who network to find them, they leave most of the Body oblivious.
- Organic House Churches keep an intimate connection with all the members, so everyone is motivated to serve each other.
- Unfortunately, the leadership is usually held unaccountable for [sins](morality-sins.md) and the [culture](people-culture.md) can often turn rebellious against larger churches.

The **Multi-Site/Satellite** model can split and reproduce into a separate campus at any time after reaching specific milestones.

- A network of churches creates an enormous pool of resources the whole string of churches can use.
- Unfortunately, they're often held together by a leader's personality, which creates a homogenous, fake culture if the plant isn't sufficiently [remixed](mind-creativity.md) in its [destination culture](people-culture.md).

The **Missional Incarnate** model is like the Traditional model, but stays smaller to focus on relationships.

- Missional Incarnate is a hybrid of Traditional and Organic House churches.
- The culture focuses on [discipleship](spiritual-discipleship.md) in its surrounding community, so they're constantly moving and shifting to environmental needs.
- While members keep room for outside growth, they encourage each other to get involved.

### Logistics

The simplicity and diversity of a church decays at least somewhat as soon as it buys real estate:

1. The extra overhead costs will require a minimum amount of contribution to pay the mortgage and utilities.
2. Eventually, some members would prefer a partition for crying babies.
3. Then, some members will want a separate children's ministry to keep the children from disrupting the service.
4. Then, that children's church will expand to a middle/high school group.
5. Over time, it'll start segmenting into other groups (e.g., college, singles, elder groups).
6. By this point, everyone has been demographically siloed and the church is no longer a unified body anymore.

Therefore, the best way to stay healthy is to never exceed 150 people, but preferably never surpass 60.

- At that point, the split should come through an intentional purpose (e.g., church plant, missionary venture, etc.).

### Correctly measuring success

Most measuring conventions create a perverse incentive ([Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law)):

- Attendance metrics motivate flashy, shallow performances to increase attendance.
- Conversion metrics motivate shallow presentations and high-pressure [sales pitches](marketing.md).
- Membership metrics motivates [high-pressure selling](marketing.md) for membership.
- Ministries or event metrics build a frenzy of unproductive activities.
- [Financial](power-types.md) metrics incentivize pushing people to give for the wrong reasons.
- Preparedness metrics (i.e., how "equipped" believers are) will often degenerate into a [bureaucratic system](mgmt-badsystems.md) of attending classes.

Some of the best measurements are *still* difficult to define:

- Measuring member satisfaction is difficult to trace and doesn't distinguish between legitimate issues and individual sins.
- Measuring spiritual growth is impossible because [religious people can imitate it](people-lying.md).
- Measuring fulfilled ministry needs often requires people to discuss things God told them to stay silent on.

However, missionary satisfaction and church plant success are worth tracking.

- Missionaries are the front lines and church plants are the supporting teams for fulfilling Jesus' great commission ([Matthew 28:19](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.28.19)).
- Outside of helping other denominations, missionaries and church plants are *the* most selfless possible ministry activities.
