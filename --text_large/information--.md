Building fieldstone walls: you don't plan ahead to gather these
particular stones for that wall. You just walk around and pick up a few
good-looking stones for the future and make a pile. Then when you get
around to building the wall, you look into the stone pile and find a
nice match for the section you're working on at the moment. Make a habit
of gathering mental fieldstones. Once you have some piled up, the
process of building walls becomes easy. It's a good habit to get into.

The overabundance of information has resulted in a poverty of knowledge
and attention.

Information is raw data in a given context. For instance, the fact that
Microsoft bought some company for a billion dollars is just information,
and there's no shortage of information these days. Knowledge imparts
meaning to that information. You apply your time, attention, and skill
to information to produce knowledge. Looking at that particular
Microsoft acquisition and knowing how it might change the market,
provide new opportunities, and destroy others constitutes knowledge.

- we eventually naturally filter out the "useless" information, but will often get stuck with what we're familiar with
- in all reality, it doesn't really matter, since the quantity of information NEVER has as much meaning as its quality

Information consumption is only good when it produces something

When reading blogs or books or listening to podcasts or audio books, take action notes.

consider the facts/minute:
- your time is more important than anything else, so the faster you consume the key information the better off you are
- ideally, you're consuming 5 facts/minute, or one every 12 seconds
- however, most people without practice consume about 2 f/m
- multitasking cuts this down to about a .5 f/m limit
- most standard podcasts are assembled to be .2-.4 f/m
- the trouble with multitasking, however, is that you have to be attentive to WHEN a fact will express
  - this is actually easy to intuitively discover: pay attention to the commanding tone of voice the speaker makes when they make an assertion they believe
  - the best thing to do is to either do something VERY boring (e.g., dishes), or just find a higher f/m source
- there is also an EFFECTIVE/NEW facts/minute, which is how it applies to YOU
  - you'll notice a drop-off on new information after the first few minutes
  - stop consuming when you get below 1 nf/m

the convenience of simply saving the information has deadened us to the significance of that information
- we must write things down that have legitimate value

the trick to working through a LOT of information is to not let the feelings hit about the experience until AFTER you've consumed it
- this takes training, but basically means memetically [memorizing] what you experience, then recollecting what you did while [meditating] or [decompressing](fun) later

information is NOT as important as knowledge (go through DKIM pyramid)

Videos are great for information but useless at transformation.

"News is what someone else does not want you to print. All the rest is advertising."

Most short-term debates about the future are NOT about what is going to happen, which is often fairly obvious, but about when.

Emotional reactions are usually far more significant than events themselves.

## Reading
* Read it twice if you don't get it. Google it if you still don't get it. Try to understand what you're reading before moving to the next thing.
* Don't keep more than you can read in the next 4 weeks on your Kindle

## Caring & focus
* Family first, work last 
* Protect your time
* You won't have more time later, so avoid collections of "to do" or "to watch/listen" lists.
* Don't use any read-it later app
* Don't keep big todo lists
* Don't keep more than you can read in the next 4 weeks on your Kindle
