## deal-making

NOTE: THIS DOVETAILS WITH ENTREPRENEUR PERSONALITY

Most self-made billionaires have preferred to focus on more lucrative
activities. By swinging more deals and overcoming the leveling effect of
competition, they have become far wealthier than managers who were much
more adept at handling the details.

"He's only interested in the chase of the deal-at the point he feels he
has it locked up, he loses interest in the details."
Associates of consummate deal maker Wayne Huizenga describe him in
similar terms.

## innovative

Group-thinkers have not cracked the Forbes 400 in significant numbers
for one simple reason: Doing the same thing in the same way as everyone
else is decidedly not the way to overcome the leveling effects of
competition.

Outorganizing the competition, in contrast, is one proven method of
breaking away from the pack. The opportunity arises precisely because of
certain maladies that give the word "organization" a negative
connotation. Companies that exhibit the following sorts of behavior
become sitting ducks for rivals that can respond quickly and effectively
to an evolving competitive environment:
• Long lines of communication keep senior management unaware of changes
in the marketplace.
• Fear of rocking the boat discourages employees from coming forward
with worthwhile ideas.
• Primary focus on avoiding mistakes deters managers from taking risks.
• Obsession with defending turf diverts managers from capitalizing on
business opportunities.

## magnanimity

What makes the self-made billionaires' knack for building effective
companies distinctive has little to do with the formal elements, such as
organizational charts and performance measurement. It is more a matter
of giving their organizations the stamp of their invariably strong
personalities.

## releasing control

It would be inaccurate to characterize the subjects of How to Be a
Billionaire as hands-on managers. Getting bogged down in operational
details would have diverted their attention from the more essential task
of amassing personal wealth. Instead, they have focused on three
essential aspects of management: organization, recruitment, and motivation.

• Attract managers with enough self-confidence to challenge your own
judgment on matters.
• Delegate authority to detail-oriented executives who can free you to
concentrate on billion-dollar ideas.
• Stay close enough to operations to be aware of problems and
opportunities, making sure that your lieutenants follow up on
suggestions for improvement.
• Constantly reinforce a focus on controlling costs.
• Use equity incentives to provide your managers and other key employees
a realistic chance to become millionaires.
• Show genuine, personal concern for people within your organization.
• Promote morale by maintaining a sense of fun along with seriousness of
purpose.

Branson motivates employees to excel by putting them into slightly
higher positions than they expect. Like Kirk Kerkorian, Branson has no
difficulty delegating day-to-day operations, much preferring to spend
his time on new ventures. As long as a business is doing well, he does
not bother to meet with management, while making himself available for
crises.

## scaling the political ladder

When a transportation officer admitted he did not know the whereabouts
of a customer's overdue shipment, Moyers snarled, "Well, you'd better
know tomorrow or you won't have a job."

Soon after arriving at Southern Pacific, Moyers called together 27 vice
presidents and told them that within two months many of them would be
gone. The meeting was over.

The transaction created the nation's largest railroad and left Phil
Anschutz as its largest shareholder. Now it was time for him to go into
high gear by applying the billionaires' principle "Keep on Growing."

An ordinary entrepreneur might have simply declared victory after
parlaying $90 million into $1.4 billion, but not Anschutz. While cashing
in his railroad investment, he held on to a fiber-optics operation he
had constructed along the Southern Pacific's rights-of-way. The company,
Qwest Communications International, went public less than a year after
the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger cleared its last regulatory
hurdle. Within six months, the stock had risen by about 175 percent. The
85 percent stake that Anschutz retained was valued at $3.5 billion; his
initial investment in the venture amounted to only $55 million.

An analysis of the great fortunes founded since the nineteenth century
showed you that they greatly improved their chances by focusing their
energies in high-growth industries. You then studied the nine
fundamental strategies that the self-made billionaires pursued:
- Take Extraordinary Risks
- Do Business in a New Way
- Dominate Your Market
- Consolidate an Industry
- Buy Low
- Thrive on Deals
- Outmanage the Competition
- Invest in Political Influence
- Resist the Unions

The billionaires' stories showed you the extraordinary power of the
following key principles:
- Pursue the Money in Ideas
- Rules Are Breakable
- Copying Pays Better Than Innovating
- Keep on Growing
- Hold on to Your Equity
- Hard Work Is Essential
- Use Financial Leverage
- Keep the Back Door Open
- Make Mistakes, Then Learn from Them
- Frugality Pays
- Enjoy the Pursuit
- Develop a Thick Skin

Overcome the leveling effects of competition by applying superior
management skills or investing in political influence.

Genuinely resolving to become a billionaire means committing yourself
wholeheartedly to the goal. It requires a dedication no less intense
than training to swim the English Channel. Making up your mind to be
superrich means subordinating other goals to an all-consuming quest for
wealth.

You will not prosper by performing any activity in a perfunctory way,
regardless of whether it has to do with making money. Far from
distracting you from the goal of becoming superrich, intensely applying
yourself to other aspects of your life will cultivate the habit of
excelling.

Bill Gates's intensity extends beyond the workplace. When he was dating
Ann Winblad, another pioneer in the computer software industry, the
couple chose motifs for the brief vacations they could spare the time to
take. On a physics-themed vacation, for example, they read as many books
on the subject as they could pack and listened to recordings of a
lecture series by Richard Feynman.

### Cross-selling (2) - Matt Levine

That said, the idea is not a bad one. Good investment bankers understand that, while their client is the _company_, the path to a good client relationship runs through befriending and helping out the company's _executives_. Sometimes this means helping them out with good corporate-finance ideas that will impress the board or their bosses, but other times it means helping them out in their personal capacity. Classically this means taking them golfing. Sometimes it means referring executives to new jobs, which can be good for the new employer and also make the executive more loyal to the banker. And sometimes hooking an executive up with a really good private wealth adviser — if you happen to have one — _is_ good client service. The question is just how confident the investment bankers are that their bank's private wealth managers are really good ones.

Bloomberg's Heather Perlberg [caught up a while back](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35377662.266794/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDUtMTQvZHJleGVsLXMtZG9uLWVuZ2VsLWhhcy1kaWVkLWhpcy10YWxlcy1vZi13YWxsLXN0cmVldC13b21lbi1hbmQtd2VhbHRoLWxpdmUtb24_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDUxNDI0X01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjQwNTE0JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96B8ea73d61) with Don Engel, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banker who died earlier this year. He seems to have specialized in winning corporate financing business by helping executives in their personal capacity:

> Engel was quick to admit that he was never one of the financial brains at Drexel. He worked in the corporate finance department but he didn't have an MBA. What he did have, however, was an almost preternatural sense for what clients really wanted. That sense, Engel insisted, could be at times more useful than numbers and business school case studies ever could. CEOs have lonely jobs, he told me. So, he set out to become a kind of therapist-in-residence at Drexel — the guy CEOs and corporate raiders could turn to in confidence to talk through personal problems. Marriages and affairs, current or prospective, were usually at the top of the list. …
> 
> "In most cases, the CEO has no one to talk to," Engel said. "He can't tell people what's going on with his wife, with his girlfriend. He can't tell them about what's going on with his mistress.''
> 
> He went on: "He is imploding, and there I am, because I understand all this. So then, once you start to understand that person, then you have a relationship. And that's what I did best."

If your investment banking job consists of talking to CEOs about their mistresses, might you also get into the ancillary business of referring potential mistresses to the executives? Engel absolutely did, is the point of the rest of the article.
