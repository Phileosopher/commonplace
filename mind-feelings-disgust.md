# What disgust is

Disgust is the [feeling](mind-feelings.md) derived from when we dislike something. The feeling itself is neutral, but both the object of the disgust as well as the [decisions](people-decisions.md) we make in light of our disgust defines vast portions of our [personality](personality.md).

When disgust is directed inward and persists chronically, it slowly becomes [guilt and shame](mind-feelings-shame.md).

[In groups](groups-member.md), disgust is the basis of social [taboos](morality-taboo.md).

Feeling disgust is a type of "negative" feeling, but every form of [success](success-1_why.md) is driven by well-placed disgust.
