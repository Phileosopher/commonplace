# How to handle extreme poverty

When you don't have *any* money, you often can't even reliably [hunt for a job](jobs-3_image.md).

- In [modern society](image-modern.md), you need a cell phone and email address you access daily more than a fixed address!

To get out of poverty, save *everything* you can:

- Every [addiction](addiction.md) must stop, even if it's only a little bit of money every time.
- Even if your friends find it offensive, become a master at [saving money everywhere](money-saving.md).
- At some point later, you *will* need to change your lifestyle to legitimately [enjoy your accumulated savings](fun.md), but you must take care of your survival and safety first.

Trust in [God](god.md), who provides everything you need when you need it.
