# The forms of art media

In some ways, the medium is not *that* important:

- The medium will match what you feel most comfortable with, and each one has pros and cons.
  - Visual elements (e.g., paintings, drawings, diagrams) are easiest for people to consume.
  - [Writing](language-writing.md) permits complete flexibility with imagination and ideas.
  - Audio connects closest to subconscious feelings and thoughts.
  Performance arts make the entire experience interactive with the audience.
  - [Software](computers-software.md) (especially [games](computers-software-gamedev.md)) is the fullest form of audience involvement possible.
  - [Creating social systems](mgmt-1_why.md) permits *other* people to be creative.
- Frequently, your talent in one medium can spill over to other media.

Every medium has its own rules for quality:

- Learn the medium's standards and limits.
- Even experimental and [trend-setting](trends.md) works acknowledge the rules by intentionally defying them.
- Art can be time-based, static, or immersive.
  - For static art (e.g., novels, films, music), focus on what occupies the center of attention.
  - For temporal art (e.g., painting, sculpture), direct all your efforts to magnifying the very last observed event.
  - For immersive art (e.g., architecture, game development), pay extremely close attention to the [user experience](engineering-design.md).

The constraints of an art medium can create very complex aspects that feed into the entirety of the created work.

## Level 0 - Raw Experience

This is the domain of nothing but the mind's raw inputs.

Thought: raw experiences

- A [feeling](mind-feelings.md) or sensation.
- The raw primitive for basically anything.
- Tends to combine with facts to create a more structured form.

## Level 1 - Raw Processing

This is the domain of the mind's raw inputs, but processed within the mind as something more complete.

- These things don't "exist" on the medium of the world around us, but they are required for us to process anything larger.

Reasoning: a form of thought

- Assembles a new thought based on at least two elements.
  - It revolves around some form of [certainty](understanding-certainty.md) to form that basis.
- Can be [logical](logic.md) reasoning, or [emotional](mind-feelings.md) expression put to [language](language.md).

Change: a depiction of movement

- Expressing two states, one after the other
- May be a [story](stories-why.md), but can also indicate two bits of [information](information.md)

Rhythm: a depiction of familiarity

- Expressing a recurring theme
- Borrows straight from our heartbeat as an "absolute"

## Level 2 - Raw Expression

This is a rudimentary form of media.

- Anyone can effectively do this, though many people won't do it well.

Inflection: a form of oral or written expression

- Expressing certain sound variations of a word.
- Built around evoking a particular feeling [common to other people](humanity-universals.md).

Calligraphy: a form of visual expression

- Expressing symbols on a surface
- Can also be described as [creative writing](language-writing.md), but also includes artistic typography

Performance: physical representation of an emotional state

- Change + Thought
- Demonstrates through reproduction of [recollected](mind-memory.md) experiences.

Visual Capture: representing a visual state of the world

- Capturing the world around us via visual expression
- As an [image](people-image-why.md), has an inherent relativity mixed with an inherent absolute
- Includes what people call "doodling" as well as photography

Physical Structure: representing the physical existence of a thing

- Thought + Reasoning
- This broadly connects with [engineering](engineering.md) and [technology](technology.md).

## Level 3 - Complex Expression

This is where the raw forms converge into clear domains of abstract demarcation.

- At this point, only a select few people in any given discipline can work well with this media.

### 3A - Visual Capture

Painting: visually expressing forms and changes within a flat visual medium

- Visual Capture + Change
- depicts a scene for the purpose of showing a story
- The extra work creates extra domains of complexity and constraints.

Sculpture: visually expressing forms and changes within a three-dimensional medium

- Visual Capture + Change + Physical Structure
- Similar to painting, but with the added domain of material and structural constraint

Digital Art: visually expressing forms and changes within a computer screen-based medium

- Visual Capture + Change
- Similar to painting, but the change is highly magnified by comparison.
- The domain of "[graphic design](engineering-graphics.md)" fits neatly into this domain.

Crafts: the miscellaneous decorative elements that compose a presentation

- Physical Structure + Change
- A high-context depiction that frames other elements

### 3B - Story Capture

Storytelling: expressing a flow of thoughts with a beginning, middle, and end

- Reasoning + Change
- Expressing a type of [human or anthropomorphized change](people-changes.md).

Diction: a form of oral expression

- Reasoning + Inflection
- Choosing words to convey an idea with sentences

Prose: a form of expressing a [story](stories-why.md)

- Storytelling + Diction
- Choosing sentences to build a sequence of concepts
- can expand into fiction, nonfiction, novels, serials, epics, etc.

Poetry: a structured means of expressing change

- Calligraphy + Inflection + Rhythm
- Typically constrained by a [patterned mechanism](symbols.md) to give more emphasis.

### 3C - Movement

Dance: performing to evoke feelings

- Performance + Physical Structure + Rhythm
- The highest possible form of human engagement without using any external tool.

Music: using rhythm to evoke change

- Change + Rhythm
- The most primal and powerful emotional force.

## Level 4 - Collaborative Expression

This requires a [team](groups-small.md) to build.

- Each contributor will invariably include their own elements that influence the final product.
- Due to [budget constraints](money-3_budget.md), there's usually a more pronounced [influence](power-influence.md) from [marketing](marketing.md) interests.

Animation: Paintings set to movement

- Painting + Prose
- The extra work means most animation takes shortcuts (e.g., photocopy, CGI), and those constraints heavily define the resulting product.

## Level 5 - Composite Expression

At this point, just about everything is a mix-and-math of earlier primitives.

Stage: precise capture of a story in real-time

- Performance + Poetry + Music
- Can range from 10 minutes to several hours of capturing an experience.

Homemaking: using crafts and storytelling to deliver a visual aesthetic

- Crafts + Storytelling
- The ideal role for [women](gender.md) who are in touch with their [feelings](mind-feelings.md), though [feminism](politics-leftism.md) sabotages this domain.

## Level 6 - Recording of Collaborative/Composite Expression

This one is the editing and framing that gives context to the lower-tier primitives.

Film: precise capturing of Stage, set to a story

- Visual Capture + Prose
- The editing is where most of the art occurs, demonstrated through advanced awareness of second-by-second directing of attention.

## Level 7 - Audience/Creator Interaction

Architecture: presenting a structure with the deep constraints of physical states

- Physical Structure + Visual Capture
- A highly advanced form of creation that serves a [utilitarian](purpose.md) mechanism alongside the aesthetic.

Website/Software Design: presenting an advanced, ordered structure for the user to interact with

- Digital Art + Change

[Game Development](computers-software-gamedev.md): presenting a specific type of Software Design that focuses strictly on the user's [feelings](mind-feelings.md)
