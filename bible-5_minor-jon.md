# Jonah

Jonah was, effectively, the worst prophet ever.

- He didn't do what God wanted until he was forced to.
- He had zero compassion on the people, and in fact didn't want to prophesy to them *because* of his hatred (since he knew God's grace).
- His hatred for them didn't go away even with God's coaxing.

Yet, at the same time, he demonstrated many images that pattern themselves elsewhere.

- He delivered a psalm while in the fish.
- His journey was God's "common grace" placed on him and toward him.

This demonstrates God's capacity to use anyone and anything, at any time, to accomplish His purposes, no matter how stubborn or antagonistic to God they are.
