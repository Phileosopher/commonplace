# Failed prophecies of the end of the world - 1200-1966

1200-1260

- The Calabrian monk Joachim of Fiore was inspired Easter Sunday in 1183 to write his massive Exposition on Revelation. Near the end of his life, he summarized his prophetic knowledge in the Book of Figures. His writings influenced a wide range of medieval events.
  - The Franciscan order was founded on the basis that they would be the spiritual elite described in Joachim's "Age of the Spirit," a future time when God would send revelation directly to believers.
  - Using Joachim's hints, writers concluded that the "Age of Grace" would end and the "Age of the Spirit" would begin in A.D. 1260. This prophecy, mixed with German social unrest, created a myth surrounding Frederick II. Having ruled from 1220 to 1250, many believed that Frederick was the "Emperor of the Last Days" who would usher in the new Millennium. The myth gained force when Frederick seized Jerusalem in 1229. When he died in 1250, a new myth started that Frederick would return from the dead. Two pseudo-Fredericks were burned at the stake by his successor to the throne.

Their communal activities eventually turned bloody, but after a crushing defeat at the hands of the German army, the group quickly disbanded.

- A repeat of the Muntzer affair occurred a few years later. This time, Jan Matthys took over the city of Munster, which was to be the only one spared destruction. The inhabitants of Munster, chased out by Matthys and his men, regrouped and laid siege to the city. Within a year, everyone in the city was dead.
