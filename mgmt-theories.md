# Management theories list

This is a list of various management theories and frameworks.

## Management styles

### Action-centered leadership

Clarifies how a leader is useful relative to getting things done.

Separate out and list a Leader, their Tasks, the Teams, and Individuals.

1. Leaders only exist for a Task.
2. The quality of a Leader comes from how well they understand how to do the Task.
3. The Team is a group devoted to performing the Tasks.
4. Each Individual has various [desires](mind-feelings.md), [fears](mind-feelings-fear.md), [motivations](purpose.md), and [experiences](stories.md).
5. A Leader's job is to encourage the Team to do the Tasks.
6. The Leader will have to modify *how* they encourage the Individual based on that person's context from D.

### Blake-Mouton managerial grid

Defines whether a leader is helping people or results more.

Analyze a manager into 2 spectra:

- People-Concerned - prioritizes [group members'](groups-member.md) benefits, what they enjoy the most, and the best interests for their careers.
- Production-Concerned - prioritizes getting the job done as [effectively](results.md) as possible and the organization's best interests.

These management styles can fit onto a graph:

- Impoverished - doesn't help either people and production.
- Country Club - the workers like it, but it doesn't create results.
- Produce or Perish - gets the job done, but uses and burns out workers.
- Team Leadership - fully provides for people *and* production, which is physically impossible and tends to lean into Country Club or Produce or Perish.
- Middle of the Road - half-concerned for people, half-concerned for results.

### Dunham & Pierce's leadership process model

Generally addresses how each element that associates with leadership is vastly interconnected.

Demarcate several significant factors:

- A **Leader** is anyone in charge of a project or people, no matter what their title is.
- **Followers** are people led by the Leader who create most of the results.
- **Context** includes various conditions for the Leader to manage the team including the project length and what the manager is able to do.
- **Outcomes** are the consequences from the project success or failure.

All the leadership aspects interconnect in a circular (not linear) relationship, using other elements:

- **Relationships** grow between the Leader and Followers.
- **People** tend to use their natural skills and tend to ignore assigned responsibilities outside those skills.
- **Feedback** from the Followers is critical for the Leaders.
- Everything only stays in harmony with [ethical](morality.md), honest behavior from everyone.

### Fiedler's contingency model

Observes on a relationship/task spectrum how various leadership styles and approaches can affect someone.

Have a leader describe their feelings to their least-liked coworker on a scale of 1 to 8:

- Unfriendly to Friendly
- Unpleasant to Pleasant
- Rejecting to Accepting
- Tense to Relaxed
- Cold to Warm
- Boring to Interesting
- Backbiting to Loyal
- Uncooperative to Cooperative
- Hostile to Supportive
- Guarded to Open
- Insincere to Sincere
- Unkind to Kind
- Inconsiderate to Considerate
- Untrustworthy to Trustworthy
- Gloomy to Cheerful
- Quarrelsome to Harmonious

The score (up to 128) determines how people-oriented the leader is, with task-oriented being the alternative.

- Task-oriented managers tend to see less-liked coworkers poorly, and are great in situations requiring tasks or organizing a group but terrible at relationship-building and managing [conflicts](people-5_conflicts.md).
- People-oriented managers tend to see less-liked coworkers more positively, and are great at avoiding/managing conflicts and making complex decisions.

Next, measure 3 factors to determine what the situation is:

- Leader-Member Relations - how much trust and confidence the Members have in the Leader
- Task Structure - how clear the tasks are
- Leader's Position Power - the amount of power the leader has to direct the Members

Generally, if the leader is liked, the tasks are clear, and the leader has lots of power, then task-oriented managers are best, and people-oriented managers are better as things become less favorable.

### Hersey-Blanchard's situational leadership theory

Categorizes management styles based on relationship versus task focus, but considers the manager's past experience in managing.

Telling Style (low relationship, high task)

- The most direct form of leadership: the leader tells them what to do and how they want it done.
- The leader and team members work very little together.
- Works best with Maturity Level 1 (M1) workers: least experienced and needs a leader to tell them how to do almost everything, could be from low-knowledge or subservient background.

Selling Style (high relationship, high task)

- More chances of working together on something than simply telling people what to do.
- The leader speaks more often with team members and convinces them to follow specific methods.
- Works best with Maturity Level 2 (M2): slightly more knowledge and skill than M1s, more willingness to do tasks even when they need assistance.

Participant Style (high relationship, low task)

- The leader builds relationships with team members, who are performing their own tasks independently.
- Often, the leader's tasks will blend in with members' tasks, and the leader might even give some decisions to members.
- Works best with Maturity Level 3 (M3): excited to work on the job, has most of the skills to perform it, can do most of the work alone.

Delegating Style (low relationship, low task)

- The leader passes on most responsibilities for a project or task to team members.
- Leaders with experienced teams will rarely need to direct or interact with members.
- Works best with Maturity Level 4 (M4): fully able and willing to do the tasks without a leader.

### Lewin's leadership styles framework

Less heavily categorized than most, but defines how leaders can respond to contextual situations.

Each person has a context-dependent balance of 3 distinctive leadership styles:

1. Authoritarian Leadership - takes command and doesn't pass on any decision-making responsibility.
2. Participative Leadership - works as part of a team and expects group input.
3. Delegative Leadership - hands off responsibilities entirely to team members and trusts them completely.

### Path-goal theory

Defines leadership as a means of attaining a goal through the leader's [vision](imagination.md) for a path.

All goals have a pathway, and a leader's job is to guide everyone down that path:

1. Clear the path by helping team members see the goal (or clear mid-points if the end isn't in sight).
2. Step in to correct inevitable obstructions which arise on the path.
3. Visualize and remove future obstacles to the project.
4. Offer rewards to keep team members motivated and happy as they go.

In this view, each leader has a mix of 4 different styles:

1. Supporting - builds relationships and shows individual interest with each member.
2. Directing - gives assignments and objectives.
3. Participative - motivates team members by treating them as equals in authority.
4. Achievement-Oriented - offers incentives and rewards to make members feel recognized and accomplished.

### Tannenbaum-Schmidt leadership continuum

Divides along a spectrum between Manager-Oriented leadership (like a dictator) and Team-Oriented Leadership (driven by members' involvement and ideas).

1. Tells - gives direct instructions with limited interaction, usually with a distrusting attitude.
2. Sells - still directly commands, but the leader listens to members' input.
3. Suggests - a softer approach than selling that requests the team's input about decisions.
4. Consults - trusts team members to ask their advice, gives [legitimate power](power-types.md) to members.
5. Joins - the leader is more a member than a dictator, keeps control over choices but makes decisions alongside the team.
6. Delegates - implicitly believes in the team and expects them to perform.
7. Abdicates - leader lets the team run itself from start to finish and is completely uninvolved.

## Project models

### Areas of Operation (AOs)

The system divides out the roles and responsibilities to specific individuals:

1. Designate sub-leaders who are exclusively responsible for specific, non-overlapping domains.
   - The domains can be contiguous (shares a boundary with other sub-leaders) or non-contiguous (not sharing a boundary).
2. That sub-leader is responsible for that domain, and their management performance is defined by their results.
   - If any members fail, that sub-leader is exclusively responsible.

While the system works *very* well for clearly defined goals with clearly-defined actions (e.g., military activities), it's very inflexible to changes and doesn't accommodate the individuals' situations or ideas.

### The Waterfall model

The system step-by-step sequence across 5 phases to carry the project to completion:

1. Requirements - outline the high-level conditions that determine a project's success.
2. Design - create solutions that meet the requirements, often considering backup plans as well.
3. Implementation - pick a design and use [technology](technology.md) to apply it.
4. Verification - test whether the implementation worked.
5. Maintenance - keep testing and [fixing anything that breaks](fix.md).

It requires specific goals from the very beginning.

- It works on hard deadlines and treats every task as "final".
- Any failures from previous process steps roll into later process tasks.

This system doesn't handle unexpected problems very well.

### Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

The system is designed to achieve clearly-understood purposes:

1. Make an objective that is significant, concrete, and clearly defined.
   - Further, the objectives should inspire everyone working toward them.
   - Avoid a "business as usual" attitude, which means avoiding vague words like "help" and "consult".
2. Each objective should have 3-5 key results, which are measurable either as 0-100% or a numerical value.
   - Aim to measure leading indicators (readily measurable things) instead of lagging indicators (things that measure after a lead time).
   - The target success rate for key results should be 70%, since it encourages competitive goal-making.
   - If the key results are consistently hit at 100%, they should be re-evaluated.
3. If necessary, objectives can be supported by initiatives, which are plans and activities that help move forward the objectives and key results.

One of the downsides of the system is that on the individual level the entire project simply looks like a task list, which makes it very easy for managers to conflate OKRs with performance reviews.

### Agile methodology

The system is designed for when project goals aren't entirely clear:

1. Break the project into sub-projects, called "sprints".
2. At the end of a sprint, everyone reviews the work and makes adjustments for the next sprint.
3. In difficulties come in the middle of a sprint, make smaller sub-projects within that sprint with newer, smaller goals.
4. Repeat until complete.

The original idea was from [software development](computers-programming-basics.md), where the goals and possible risks aren't always perfectly clear.

- The system revises every development stage as the situation changes.
- Other variations of Agile like [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) or [Lean](https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/) add more structure.

### Holacracy

[The system](https://www.holacracy.org/) is a very flat management structure designed around a constitution made of 5 modules, which everyone is expected to follow:

1. Organizational structure
   - Defines an exact format for roles, responsibilities, and rules.
2. Rules of cooperation
   - Defines what everyone should expect from each other.
   - Clarifies duties involving everyone being transparent with each other, how they process others' requests, and how everyone should prioritize work.
3. Tactical meetings
   - Gives specific standards for how to run meetings and keep them efficient.
   - Also prevents from anyone dominating the meeting or distractions about unrelated discussions.
4. Distributed authority
   - Speeds tasks up by granting partial autonomy without needing prior approval.
   - Creates constraints to prevent abuse of that autonomy.
5. Decentralized governance process
   - Creates a process for making improvements or changes within the scope of each person's work.
   - Gives limits to prevent anyone abusing the governance process.

The system gives everyone power to self-manage, which is a very effective system if everyone is trustworthy to self-direct.

- If everyone depends heavily on each other, though, it can cause severe breakdowns in communications and activities and be *worse* than micromanagement.

## Team building models

### 7-S framework

The model breaks apart and independently analyzes aspects of an organization:

- Strategy - [purposes](purpose.md) and how the organization gets to them.
- Structure - agreed-upon organizational order.
- Systems - informal [habits](habits.md) the group has adopted.
- Shared Values - shared group [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md).
- Style - the [culture](people-culture.md) behind everyone acting.
- Staff - the specific members themselves and their roles.
- Skills - qualified [specializations](jobs-specialization.md) of the members.

### Belbin team roles

Helps define roles into 9 domains based on comparative [personality](personality.md) assessments.

Thought-Oriented

- Monitor Evaluator - fact-based decision-maker
- Specialist - niche understanding of technical facts, often serves as an advisor
- Plant - [creative](mind-creativity.md) idea-maker, often works alone

Action-Oriented

- Shaper - extrovert focused on influencing others to action
- Implementer - practical-minded, accomplishes task lists
- Completer/Finisher - introverts who test and finalize things

People-Oriented

- Coordinator - high-agreeableness focused on influencing others to agreeing to objectives
- Team Worker - effective [listener and communicator](language-speaking.md) who seeks group harmony
- Resource Investigator - extrovert who finds new resources and social connections

### Margerison-McCann team management profile

First, the system asks questions that explore how an individual prefers to work:

- Relating to others
- Gathering and using information
- Making decisions
- Organizing themselves and others

Then, they group people based on their preferences:

1. Demarcate between Explorers and Controllers (EC)
2. Demarcate between Advisors and Organizers (AO)

The result should be a graph indicating their general tendencies toward approximate types of social interaction:

1. Linker (mid-EC, mid-AO)
   - Enjoys connecting everyone with everyone else
   - i.e., all managers
   - Everyone performs the Linker role, but it's particularly important for the leader to stay in that role
2. Reporter-Advisor (mid-EC, A)
   - Enjoys giving and gathering information
   - e.g., researcher
3. Creator-Innovator (A, E)
   - Enjoys finding new ideas and different approaches to tasks
   - e.g., artist
4. Explorer-Promoter (E, mid-AO)
   - Enjoys exploring possibilities and finding new opportunities
   - e.g., philosopher
5. Assessor-Developer (E, O)
   - Enjoys analyzing new opportunities and making them happen
   - e.g., event planner
6. Thruster-Organizer (mid-EC, O)
   - Enjoys guiding people toward making results
   - e.g., manager
7. Concluder-Producer (C, O)
   - Enjoys systematically making outputs
   - e.g., factory worker
8. Controller-Inspector (C, mid-AO)
   - Enjoys testing outputs
   - e.g., quality assurance
9. Upholder-Maintainer (C, A)
   - Enjoys keeping things going
   - e.g., maintenance

## Project tracking

### Determining ideal scenarios

#### Katzenbach and Smith model

It's a pyramid/triangle representation, with each corner and edge representing a different value.

- The corners represent the inputs/outputs:
  - Performance Results is at the top.
  - Collective Work Products is at the left.
  - Personal Growth is at the right.
- Edges represent how they connected:
  - Commitment binds Collective Work Products and Personal Growth.
    - This can include specific goals, a common approach, or a meaningful purpose.
  - Skills bind Collective Work Products and Performance Results.
    - These can be technical, problem-solving, or interpersonal.
  - Accountability binds Personal Growth and Performance Results.
    - These can be mutual, a few people, or individual.

While the model is great for observing the ideal scenario for the group, it doesn't work well as a [diagnostic tool](fix.md).

The system is intuitive because it focuses on the necessary components for achieving outputs, and with plenty of specific information about each of the factors for it.

However, it emphasizes smaller-sized teams, even when it's not always realistic.

#### LaFasto and Larson model (aka Five Dynamics of Team Work and Collaboration)

It draws from 5 common elements within almost all effective teams:

1. Members - need to be the right people
2. Relationships - members need to work well with each other
3. Problem-Solving - need to focus on work, openly communicate, and have a good attitude
4. Leadership - needs the right leader
5. Organizational Environment - the organization at large needs to give adequate support and resources

The model has been well-researched, and helps to distinguish between teams made of competent individuals and effective teams.

It also doesn't give guidance on how leaders and teams can acquire any of the missing elements.

#### Robbins and Judge model

It indicates 4 key elements that contribute to a team's productivity and unity:

- Context - external factors in the organization that affect the team's success
- Composition - the skills, preferences, characteristics, and experiences of each member
- Work Design - the range of tasks each member receives and how they perform it
- Process - how the team plans and achieves goals, as well as shared values or mission statement

It indicates that a manager has to perform 4 main functions:

- Planning - [setting goals](success-3_goals.md), creating strategies, and preparing plans
- Organizing - identifying tasks, dividing them out, assigning, tracking, and building [decision-making systems](decisions.md)
- Leading - [motivating](power-influence.md) workers, directing actions, choosing communication channels, resolving [conflicts](people-5_conflicts.md)
- Controlling - determining others' work outcomes, checking on status, [taking corrective actions](mgmt-5_communication.md)

While it captures each member's specific traits, it also runs the risk of overlooking *how* people achieve unity together.

### Determining present status

#### Drexler-Sibbet model

It proposes 4 key stages to build a team, then 3 stages that encourage the team to self-improve:

1. Orientation - the team asks why their responsibilities and efficiency matter
2. Building Trust - members learn more about each other, such as their respective skills and experiences
3. Goal Clarification - team determines and specifies its purposes
4. Commitment - team determines how it'll achieve its goals, often with a timeline and resource assessment
5. Implementation - team determines additional necessary details to complete tasks and achieve goals
6. High Performance - team begins improving their shared tasks and can work more autonomously
7. Renewal - members and leaders self-reflect to see what they did well and what they could improve on in the future

While it's very effective at seeing what can be improved, it doesn't easily capture how issues arise and how to resolve them.

#### T7 model

It identifies 7 internal and external factors that constitute a team's effectiveness:

- Internal factors
  - Thrust - the team's [purpose](purpose.md)
  - Trust - team members' mutual [confidence](trust.md) and respect
  - Talent - qualified members with skills and [experience](understanding.md)
  - Task Skills - members' ability to complete specific processes efficiently
  - Teamwork/Teaming - members' individual skill at working within a team environment
- External factors
  - Team-Leader Fit - how well the leader works well with the team
  - Team Support - how well the organization itself can support the team

It gives a broad overview of the team's effectiveness, but doesn't work well at helping improve any of the factors.

- In particular, it's not very effective at pinpointing anything useful for external factors.

#### Tuckman's FSNP/FSNPA model

It theorizes that highly effective teams move through a [story](stories.md) of 4-5 stages:

1. Forming
   - Everyone depends highly on the leaders for guidance.
   - Roles and responsibilities aren't very clear.
   - Members test other members' and leadership's tolerance.
   - Not much focus on processes.
   - The leadership will need to give very clear instructions on the team's purpose, goals, and outside relationships.
2. Storming
   - Clear [disagreements](people-conflicts.md) about group decisions.
   - While some purpose is clear, other things are still uncertain.
   - Cliques and factions form over values.
   - The leader will have to [convince](power-influence.md) the members to align their goals with the group's.
3. Norming
   - The team will generally find agreements on what to do and how to do it.
   - Roles and responsibilities are clear and broadly accepted.
   - The members are committed to the group, and may even engage in extra-group activities like social events together.
   - The leader is generally respected at this stage.
4. Performing
   - The team is now aware of the domain outside themselves.
   - Members have an independently-maintained shared vision that no longer needs the leaders' involvement.
   - Conflicts exist, but are resolved positively within the team without needing much management intervention.
   - The leadership is responsible to delegate more tasks and projects to continue motivating the members.
5. Adjourning/Adapting
   - When any significant members leave or enter the group, it begins the cycle again.
   - At the end of the project, the members part ways.
   - Some members will feel a sense of loss or insecurity over the end of the experience working together.
   - The leadership isn't responsible for members at this point, but the most humane thing they can do is direct members to other projects or efforts.

The model works well to know how and how much the leadership should be involved.

However, it only works for new teams, and doesn't give much context for long-term teams who constantly work together.

- Further, it doesn't give any context for teams who seem to be stuck at a certain stage without moving forward (e.g., Norming but not Performing).

### Diagnosing issues

#### GRPI model

It has 4 groups stacked into a pyramid-shaped hierarchy:

1. Goals are clearly defined and achievable objectives at the top of the pyramid.
2. Roles are distinct duties and responsibilities that managers must track.
3. Procedures are well-defined ways to work, communicate and make decisions.
4. Interpersonal Relationships are the shared commitments members have made to communication, trust, and respect.

Design, planning, and development goes down the pyramid, from Goals to Roles to Processes to Interpersonal Relationships.

Diagnoses of issues go up the pyramid, from interpersonal relationships to processes to roles to goals.

It requires the team to observe their issues from many perspectives instead of making assumptions about how things are failing.

However, the system tends to oversimplify the natural complexity of interpersonal relationships within the group.

#### Hackman's Five Factor model

It indicates 5 factors that can improve a team's functionality:

- Team Status - clearly defined membership, roles, and communication
- Compelling Direction - goals and incentives drive the members through clear incentives
- Enabling Structure - team processes and workflows that encourages teamwork and communication
- Support - the organization at large gives access to resources and information the team needs
- Expert Coaching - [influential](power-influence.md) leaders guide the team

While it looks at all aspects of the team, it doesn't consider how people can be motivated by different things.

There is also a Salas, Dickinson, Converse, and Tannenbaum Model that adds to Hackman's Model:

- Company Context - the organization at large gives very specific time-sensitive information to the team
- Team Design - the specific types of people and the specific roles they have
- Team Synergy - the shared attitude about the team's goals
- Effective Processes - proven skills, knowledge, and strategies for performing tasks
- Resources - how available an organization at large supports the team
- Team [Culture](people-culture.md) - the interpersonal dynamic, attitude toward the organization, and commitment to the project

#### Lencioni Model

It focuses on how things can *fail* instead of succeed:

1. Absence of Trust - members don't feel they can be comfortable, honest, and vulnerable with each other.
2. Fear of Conflict - members are afraid to disrupt the situation, so they stay quiet to maintain harmony.
3. Lack of Commitment - members aren't devoted to the team's goal, so they won't work together.
4. Avoiding Accountability - members don't recognize, respect, or appreciate their role in the team.
5. Inattention to Results - members don't pay attention to the larger reason why they're working together.

While this model hasn't been proven scientifically, it helps in observing intuitive social failures across groups.

While it's great at diagnosing dysfunctional patterns, it doesn't help much to [actually fix the problems](fix.md).
