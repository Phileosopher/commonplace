Time is short for people to hear the [Gospel](jesus-gospel.md).

- Jesus has called us to travel out and make [disciples](spiritual-discipleship.md) across the world ([Matthew 28:19](https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm)), which starts with sharing it with everyone open to hearing it.

Sharing Jesus is a lifestyle [decision](decisions.md) that comes from [understanding](understanding.md) and imitating [what Jesus did](jesus-gospel.md) ([1 Peter 2:21](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-21.htm)).

Evangelism is for everyone.

- The angels could do a better job than Christians, but God wants believers to share in the experience ([Luke 1:11-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/1.htm), [Acts 1:10-11](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/1.htm)).
- Any Christian can share the Gospel, even right after becoming one, and can simply be a 2-minute conversation.
- God will place people close to your skill level for sharing, so don't worry about fouling it up.

There are many [competitors](religion.md) and [deceptions](people-lying.md), so [it won't be easy](hardship-persecution-church.md).

- Beyond your ability to sell, your reputation will come through how you [love other believers](spiritual-exercises.md) ([John 13:35](https://biblehub.com/john/13-35.htm)).

Your [personality](identity.md) defines how you may want to approach others about the subject.

- Share Jesus and what He's done for you.
- Share the [philosophical](philosophy.md)/theological reasons why you [believe](understanding-certainty.md).
- Simply learn what *other* people believe, then wait until they're interested in your views.
- Do something public and [attention-grabbing](marketing.md).

Some people imagine sharing the Gospel is telling as many people as possible.

- Effective Gospel *presentations* share Christ's story and why it's important.
- However, people are typically [influenced](power-influence.md) more to *convert* through directly observing a Christian's [decisions](decisions.md) and [lifestyle](culture.md) than hearing a compelling [story](stories.md).

Many people groups have *never* heard of Jesus.

- They need to hear.
- If God is calling you to it, go there and tell them.
- If you can't go but still have a heart for them, support them with your [skills](jobs-specialization.md), [donations](money-3_budget.md), and [prayer](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md).

## Lifestyle evangelism

We frequently overlook opportunities to share Jesus.

- Instead of waiting for future chances, take advantage of what you have now.
- They'll be suspicious or think you're crazy, especially as God starts [permanently changing you](identity.md) from the inside.

Most people won't care about what you have to say until they've seen evidence of you changing.

Expect dramatic [conflict](people-5_conflicts.md) ([Matthew 10:34-36](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/10.htm)).

- If any pre-conversion friends *also* convert to Christ, it's usually long after they've parted ways with you.

Your new lifestyle will create [rumors](image.md).

- Extended family, casual friends, and coworkers will see your changes.
- Expect to lose more relationships as time goes on.
- Don't be surprised if you lose your job, professional affiliations, and reputation.
  - Every year, millions of Christians in [persecuted countries](hardship-persecution-church.md) lose *everything* to follow Jesus.
- Eventually, your ministry will become public knowledge because it's difficult to *not* talk about Jesus when your [life revolves around Him](https://theologos.site/devotion-chaos/).

Search for new people to fill the new void.

- Find a [healthy church](church.md) (irrespective of [denomination](history-church.md)) where you can [connect](people-4_friends.md) with other believers.
- As you lose friends, you'll connect with other believers (even ones you may have previously disliked).
- Not all people in Christian culture are Christians, so don't implicitly trust a [church's brand](marketing.md).

The easiest way to share the Gospel is to donate something you have (e.g., time, energy, resources).

- Your most effective work will come through sacrifices that align with your [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md).
  - Use existing skills (or [learn them](success-5_persevering.md)) to fill the needs you see.
- Volunteer at churches and organizations to serve others' physical/emotional needs.

## Pre-made presentations

Some churches make rigid Gospel presentation systems.

- If it helps you, use that system to share Jesus, but the Holy Spirit will more often draw from your personal experiences than a formalized.
- However, most believers will eventually have a unique [story](stories.md) as they gain personal experiences.
  - It's a presentation of what God has done, so style it to your preference and experiment.
- The best Gospel presentations come from personal experience and established [beliefs](values.md), *not* a [scripted speech](language-speaking.md).

*Many* Gospel presentations have additional [creative media](creations.md) beyond the spoken/written word:

- Visual media - e.g., videos, pictures, tracts, comic books
- Performance art - e.g., body language, plays, children's entertainment
- Toys - e.g., colored gloves, cube toy with printed content
- None of the additional media is necessary, but it makes it easier to consume.

*Every* Gospel presentation requires a few elements for sufficient theological accuracy:

1. We've [sinned](morality-sins.md) and are separated from God.
2. God loves us and desires to reconcile.
3. Jesus Christ is God who came to this earth.
4. Jesus died for our sins and rose again.
5. Anyone who [believes](understanding-certainty.md) in Jesus will have their sins forgiven.

Don't obsess about appearing professional, precise, or [convincing](power-influence.md).

- The Holy Spirit will work through your imperfections, and often in remarkable ways.
- Most mainstream Christian evangelistic publications may [generate leads](marketing.md), but do *not* bring people to Jesus nearly as much as sincere, personal conversations between non-Christians and Christians.

## Spiritual conversations

[Make casual friendships](people-4_friends.md) with non-believers and seek opportunities to serve your neighbors ([Mark 12:28-31](https://biblehub.com/bsb/mark/12.htm)).

Spiritual discussions inspire [spiritual attention](spiritual-warfare.md).

- Expect distractions, discomfort, and awkward situations.
- Find ways to become comfortable with unexpected breaches of [unspoken social standards](morality-taboo.md).
- Your success comes from how much you and other believers have been [praying](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md), *not* from your skills or ability.

Behave as [politely and respectfully](people-3_boundaries.md) as possible with everyone.

- Even if others start [behaving inappropriately](people-5_conflicts.md), stay peaceable.
- If they would rather not hear it, don't even *try* to convince or convert them from what they [believe](understanding-certainty.md).
- If you're speaking with multiple people present, only share toward the most open-minded people there.
- Never control the conversation or over-assert yourself.
- Listen, respect their views, and make healthy conversations.

Public presentations

Fit your presentations with the culture.

- In Jesus' day, society permitted open-air preaching ([Acts 2:14-36](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/2.htm)).
  - Open-air preaching is actually *harmful* to the Gospel in societies that value privacy.
- Find [creative](mind-creativity.md) ways to share the Gospel:
  - Open a booth at an event to advertise fulfillment and meaning, then share the Gospel to anyone who wants to hear.
  - Print, make or buy small tracts you can give to others.
  - Always keep copies of the Bible or [pocket Gospel presentations](http://www.ptl.org) with you.
- However, sharing with people will *never* influence anyone as much as helping them with what they need because you love them ([1 Corinthians 13:1-3](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm)).

A [culture](culture.md) saturated with [marketing](marketing.md) tends to dislike [persuasive messages](power-influence.md), but won't mind you sharing your personal experience.

- Your experiences should be Jesus' message throughout your life.
- The story should adapt to each person, so don't memorize the story word-for-word.
- Avoid Christian jargon (e.g., sanctified, blessed) and refine your thoughts to simple concepts.
- People focus on the ideas more when you use fewer words.
- If they're still interested, ask them if they mind you using your Bible.
- Walk them through the [basics of salvation](jesus-gospel.md) and either drop it or pray with them as the situation permits.

God calls us to make [disciples](spiritual-discipleship.md), *not* fix the world ([Matthew 28:19-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/28.htm)).

- The humanitarian needs in this world are severe, but only Jesus can solve them (and [He eventually will](https://theologos.site/millennium/)).
- Jesus came to fix the sin condition, which has caused *all* the world's issues.
- Helping the [poor and suffering](hardship.md) is a temporary solution, but it doesn't resolve the long-term problems in our souls or [the risks of corruption within any system designed to address the problem](mgmt-badsystems.md).
- In fact, modern American culture has suffered tremendously from the "[social gospel](https://gainedin.site/here-2/)".

## Responses

Take extra effort to clearly understand that person's specific reason for not following Jesus.

- Ask questions to learn where *their* relationship with [God](god.md) is, not just to share your experience.
- Before even bringing up Jesus, learn how much they'd even want to hear about Him.
- If they resist, drop it completely and don't mention it again.
- Only try again later when you've grown to be more [gentle and loving](identity.md).

Pay very, *very* close attention to what anyone has to say about what you're sharing.

- People know when you're not paying attention to them.
- If you're doing it to gain God's favor, you're sharing the Gospel for the wrong reason.

*Never*, *ever* try to force a conversion.

- [Identifying with Christ](identity.md) requires a long-term commitment to give up *everything* ([Matthew 10:39](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.10.39)), which is too much of a sacrifice for most people ([Matthew 7:13-14](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/7.htm)).
- Successfully converting someone to Christianity in a fit of [emotional intensity](mind-feelings.md) will *not* create good [disciples](spiritual-discipleship.md) ([Matthew 13:5](https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-5.htm)).
  - A non-believer typically needs to hear the Gospel message about 12 times before they convert.
- Christians who give a sense of urgency in an evangelistic presentation don't trust God will protect them if He has plans for them ([Matthew 6:26](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm)).

Once a culture has been exposed to *lots* of evangelism, that society becomes post-Christian.

- Typically, post-Christian culture comes from generations raised in the moralism of Christianity but without the parents stressing the importance of a [relationship with Jesus](jesus-gospel.md).
- Post-Christian cultures typically need a *lot* of evidence, with can *only* come through a demonstrated lifestyle.
  - Break through the apprehension by openly discussing your own unpleasant experiences with cultural Christianity and the Church.
- The only answer to clearly connect with post-Christianity is to have legitimate love and compassion for their suffering, *without* defending or condemning what happened to them.
  - Defending a group may be misplaced, since you weren't there and there may have been a [legitimate sin](morality-sins.md) involved.
  - Condemning the group may be misplaced, since that person may have experienced a misplaced memory or had an isolated experience.
  - Their [feelings](mind-feelings.md) are legitimate, irrespective of [reality](reality.md).

### Response Types

There are a few possible, predictable ways a non-Christian will respond to a Gospel presentation.

The least likely response will be curiosity mixed with hesitant [hope](trust.md).

- To some effect, they see a potential opportunity for redemption and healing.
- They'll often distrust many elements of it, since [Jesus' sacrifice](jesus-gospel.md) does *not* require them to give [something back for the exchange](people-contracts.md).
- However, they're fully ready to follow Jesus.

They'll frequently feel severe remorse over their past [sins](morality-sins.md).

- They'll have enough shame to believe they *can't* be forgiven.
- They need someone to show how much God will forgive and restore, either through your experiences or people in the Bible (e.g., Paul, Samson, Moses).
- You can only show them through how Jesus has conquered your [shame](hardship-ptsd.md), which typically comes after [tremendous work on your end](https://theologos.site/devotion-chaos/).

They may have unease or anxiety about the risks of becoming a Christian.

- At that point in their lives, they want comfort more than truth.
- Only God can change their situation, typically by exposing them to [hardship or loss](hardship.md).
- Feel free to [coexist](people-4_friends.md) around them as long as they'll accept you, but spending [too much time](people-4_friends.md) with them may make you complacent.

They may simply be bitter or angry regarding [past trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) or [unconfessed sins](morality-sins.md).

- They'll often attribute their suffering to God, even when someone else had hurt them.
- They're in no way ready to hear the Gospel, and merely witnessing your lifestyle will be enough to morally convict them.
  - Jesus didn't come for people who don't want Him, so don't waste your time with people who mock and condemn Him ([Mark 2:17](https://biblehub.com/mark/2-17.htm)).
- Most of the Church's [persecution](hardship-persecution-church.md) comes through these people (frequently under [evil](morality-evil.md) leadership), but they still need God's love.
- If there's a strong Christian presence in that [culture](culture.md), they may have severe issues with their understanding of [Christianity](https://theologos.site/testimony/), even when they don't have an issue with the concept of following Jesus.

Occasionally, they're completely uninterested in the discussion.

- Most [younger life stages](maturity.md) in [developed cultures](conveniences.md) don't have to think about [death](hardship-death.md).
- At that point, it's a [philosophical thought experiment](paradoxes.md) or hobby to them.
- The best thing is to share with them if they want to hear it, and move on.

Some non-Christians defend their views with elaborate thinking they're typically unaware they hold.

- Many of them believe a few possible delusions:
  - [God](god.md) is a reckless child in a playground or an angry man in the clouds.
  - [Sin](morality-sins.md) is simply a perception, and doesn't exist.
  - The [spiritual world](spiritual-warfare.md) can be just as easily [understood](understanding.md) as the physical world.
  - Nobody, whatsoever, is [trustworthy](trust.md).
- Many of them are *very* skilled at making Christians lose their patience and dragging out an argument.
- Other people are legitimately seeking Jesus, and your joy is more important (and likely) than winning an argument with them.

* * * * *

## Apologetics

The word apologetics goes back to the idea of an "apology", which comes from the Greek meaning a justification or defense (literally, apo-logos, or "away-from knowledge").

Apologetics, in general, boils down to two approaches:

1. Deconstruct the other person's beliefs and provoke them to doubt their particular faith.
2. Convey a reliable framework of thought for your beliefs.
   - Everyone's faith starts as an individual [story](stories.md), then branches out into [understanding](understanding.md).

- You must choose one of them, and it's not possible to do both.

Be careful with apologetics.

- There is a steady subculture of Christians who obsess with making strong, articulate arguments to defend every aspect of their faith.
- However, each person has their path to walk, and they should walk with conviction even if it's not *precisely* correct the way you understand it ([Romans 14:1-6](https://biblehub.com/romans/14.htm)).
  - In general, you're wasting your time with denominational politics, and should focus on shared values instead ([Mark 9:38-41](https://biblehub.com/mark/9.htm)).
  - The *one* exception, though, is when that denomination is practicing [legitimate heresy](conflicts-christian.md).
- Make sure you keep in mind that Christians aren't known by their rock-solid views *nearly* as much as their love for each other ([John 13:34-35](https://biblehub.com/john/13.htm)).

Most apologetics does *not* start with the Bible.

- There's no reason to bring the Bible into a discussion where someone doesn't find it relevant.
- It only becomes relevant to them when they want to hear how it's relevant to *you*.

There are a wide variety of apologetics disciplines, based on their initial approach:

- Philosophical apologetics often draws from Catholic [philosophers](philosophy.md) (e.g., Augustine, Aquinas, Anselm).
  - These are *powerful* in many contexts, but can't refute the complete doubt and hopelessness represented in postmodernism.
  - The better approach is to aim for the [meaning](meaning.md) in Christ (often expressed through C.S. Lewis' works).
- Scientific apologetics aim to refute modern Darwinian-style thought.
  - They use the data from [scientific studies](science.md) to represent biblical truths.
  - This is a minority view in the [scientific community](science.md), mostly because the majority of scientists are atheist, but claim to have no [bias](mind-bias.md).
  - Be careful how precisely you assert some aspects of your faith, and expect to look silly if it's a public forum.
- Inter-religious apologetics aims to give clear answers in comparison to [other belief systems](religion.md).
  - The basis for the discussions should be targeted at key philosophical values, *not* about the culture surrounding those values.

No matter what, [apologetics](evangelism-apologetics.md) is only good to sow doubt, *not* to create a conversion.

- Everyone who converts from one belief system to another has to go through an "agnostic" period, where they're not really sure what they believe anymore.
- It often takes time for someone to convert, and God is the creator of the results ([1 Corinthians 3:6-8](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3.htm)).

In general, ask questions more than give statements.

- Never make an assertion when it could be expressed as a question.
- Questions bring more thought than statements.
  - By asking questions, people ask those same questions in their mind even after you're done talking with them.
  - The person answering the question has to make more assertions to defend their beliefs.
- Do *not* answer the questions unless they ask you, since it robs them of their [meaning](meaning.md) from discovering a truth.
- Most of the time, a spiritual [conflict](people-5_conflicts.md) is based in [emotions](mind-feelings.md), *not* [logic](logic.md).
  - Your purpose should be to [understand and learn](understanding.md) about them and their views, *not* to dismantle their perspective.

Eventually, you *will* get a question you don't know the answer to.

- Humbly and openly accept that you don't know.
  - Refusing to accept you don't know makes you as [conceited](morality-sins.md) as the rest of the world.
- Their questions frequently open up the need to [study more into it](bible-study.md), which can only grow you.
- Refer them to a more educated Christian or ask if you can [research](information.md) and get back to them.

[Defending Christianity](evangelism-apologetics.md) can be emotionally draining, but is frequently necessary.

- Don't run from the conflict or pretend they're not asking legitimate questions.
- Focus on sharing ideas and alternate views, and don't get distracted by their behavior in the discussion ([John 4:37](https://biblehub.com/john/4-37.htm)).
- Even if they become [verbally abusive](people-5_conflicts.md), your conduct can show Christ-like behavior.
- The situation becomes vastly more complex (and more important) when [dealing with cults](culture-cults.md).

Do *not* let yourself fall into a rhetorical trap.

- Highly educated people (e.g., philosophy [teachers](pedagogy.md)) sometimes bait ambitious believers into a debate.
  - However, they frequently have an unspoken advantage (e.g., a microphone), and will cut you off as soon as they see they're not winning.
- The best thing to do is to avoid a direct conflict by owning that it's not the right time or place, and let the conversation move on.
- Often, you'll get the freedom to have a discussion with some people later over the public exchange.
- Sometimes, people just like to argue, and continued dialogue with them is not worth your time.

* * * * *

## Evangelism and politics

Christians are ambassadors for Christ and [citizens of God's kingdom](https://theologos.site/millennium/).

- The world's issues shouldn't frustrate or distract us ([John 18:36](https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm), [2 Corinthians 5:20](https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm)).

Your reputation serves to magnify your message, so make sure your conduct is appropriate as a follower of Christ ([1 Peter 2:12-20](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2.htm)).

Your *[ministry](mgmt-church.md)* may attempt to address a problem in the world, but never let your central message distract from [eternity](humanity-christian.md).

By honoring authority, you're showing the world how we should honor God.

- God told us to honor them, irrespective of whether they hate or love Christians ([Luke 6:27-36](https://biblehub.com/bsb/luke/6.htm)).
- A permissive government provides opportunities to share the Gospel message, but an oppressive government gives room for God to work through Christians prevailing over hardship.
- The world's laws were designed for the wicked, so believers have nothing to fear ([1 Timothy 1:8-10](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1.htm)).

If you start becoming severely affected by the troubles in this world:

1. Stop ministering.
2. [Devote yourself to Him](spiritual-exercises.md) more thoroughly.
3. Trust that He will heal you.
4. Engage in ministry again when you've [found joy in Him](https://theologos.site/devotion-chaos/).

### Be careful with your freedom

Don't stop sharing the Gospel as appropriate.

It's awful [optics](marketing.md) and detrimental to the Gospel message to use [political activism](power-types.md) tactics (e.g., publicly screaming, making demands).

- [Jesus died for everyone](jesus-gospel.md), and takes it *very* personally when people are mistreated ([Matthew 25:41-45](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/25.htm)).
- In some countries, many non-Christians will use that behavior to [win lawsuits](legal-safety.md) as soon as someone physically touches them.

Sins like homosexuality aren't necessarily worse than fornication or adultery.

- Homosexuality and every other variety of sexual deviation need Jesus and the Gospel as much as everyone else.
- Even the most dogmatic Christians tend to fail at seeing that homosexuality simply God permitting a symptom of self-worship ([Romans 1:22-28](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/1.htm)).

Take a stand against abortion, suicide, and murder.

- Life is God's creation, and every person is an image of God ([Genesis 1:27](https://biblehub.com/bsb/genesis/1.htm)).
- Outside of fulfilling [justice](morality-justice.md), only God is entitled to give or take it away.
- Instead of protesting or condemning abortion, adopt the children or help them find good homes.

Christians should *always* oppose explicit, apparent [evil](morality-evil.md):

- Genocide
- Sex trafficking
- Pedophilia

Many political issues have very few grounds for a Christian to make an opinion on, and even less for political activism:

- Gun rights
- Recreational drug use or legalization (except *maybe* [1 Peter 5:8](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm))
- [Privacy](faang.md) rights
- The [economy](economics.md)
- [Climate change](leftism.md) (except that God has full control of it all)
- Government decisions and spending
- The government's use of the death penalty
- Immigration
- Foreign policy
- [Election systems](politics-systems.md) and ballot fraud
- Gay marriage (though gay [parenting](parenting-2_children.md) may have precedent)
- Violence and sexual content in media
- [War](people-conflicts-war.md), unless they run the country

Most Christians can stand for many civil rights, they must only do it within the realm of what they can control, and must always keep [God's long-game](https://theologos.site/millennium/) in mind.

- Jesus promises that [the hardships of this world](hardship.md) won't change, but that He'll still be with us ([Matthew 28:20](https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm)).

### Honor the government

Christianity has a complex, predictable pattern with all authority:

1. Leaders tolerate Christians until they interfere with those leaders' power.
2. Christians are called to submit to both God and anyone He sets in authority, even under heavy persecution ([Romans 13](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/13.htm)).
3. Over time, a successful Christian presence creates a [politically relevant](politics-conservativeliberal.md) minority.
4. After many years, Christians are eventually in [high-ranking leadership](groups-large.md) roles.
5. Christian [values](values.md) slowly [trend](trends.md) into public opinion.
6. The leaders' successors maintain the [moralism](morality.md) without the Christian presence.
7. Without Jesus, [the values eventually decay](https://theologos.site/the-west/).
8. Society eventually dislikes Christianity again with an [unfair](morality-justice.md) [bias](mind-bias.md).

* * * * *

## Not everything

Your evangelism is, to the person who converts, the beginning of a [long relationship with Jesus](identity.md).

- They will need guidance, and you're at least [partly responsible](meaning.md) for helping them.

The Christian walk, therefore, is *much* more [discipleship](spiritual-discipleship.md) than simply evangelism ([Matthew 28:18-20](https://biblehub.com/matthew/28.htm)).

Keep [pursuing Him](spiritual-exercises.md), [praying](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md), and serving to discover your [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md) and role in His Kingdom.
