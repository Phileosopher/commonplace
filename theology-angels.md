# Angels and demons

Beyond humans and beasts, there are celestial beings referenced in the Bible

- Angels
- Seraphim
- Cherubim
- There are also fallen angels, referred to as [demons](spiritual-warfare.md).

These beings have the term "elohim", which is confusing because it's also used as a term for God.

- In fact, some of these beings are *likely* gods of a lesser sort, with God having authority over them.

Given [God's nature](god.md), there are likely more that have not been mentioned in the Bible.

An "angel" is a "messenger".

- It's simply a role, and doesn't indicate *what* the being actually is.

The "seraphim" is a throne room guardian spirit.

- The word "seraph" is connected to Hebrew for "burn" and "serpent", so they're often portrayed as fiery winged serpents.
- [Isaiah 6:2](https://biblehub.com/bsb/isaiah/6-2.htm)

The "cherubim" are also divine throne guardians.

- They have a very strange appearance that lends itself to a LOT of [symbolic](symbols.md) speculation.
- [Ezekiel 1:5-10](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ezekiel/1.htm)

Thomas Aquinas grouped the heavenly beings into 3 orders:

1. Those closest to God, serving in His immediate presence.
2. Rulers of the heavens, shaping the events on Earth.
3. Those who walk among humanity as messengers and guides.

While some spiritual beings blend in [Hebrews 13:2](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-2.htm), many of the others would be legitimately terrifying if encountered on Earth.
