## metrics

Here are key metrics you should track:
Traffic Stats - I recommend using Google Analytics.
Revenue and Expenses -
Hours Spent - Using a tool like SlimTimer, track every minute you spend working on your product, broken down into development, support and marketing. This allows you to monetize your time during month-end,

I bought CMS Themer for a song (less than 2x monthly profit).
The site paid itself off in net profit in 4 months.
I owned it a total of 9 profitable months and sold it for a substantial gain.
The reason the site had literally hundreds of interested parties when I listed it for sale was due to one reason:
I had outsourced the hard part, and had tracked my time so was able to document that I had earned over $100/hour on time spent working on CMS Themer.
I was selling a business, and a well paying one, rather than a job like the previous owner.
