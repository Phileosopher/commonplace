Statistics is a relatively simple concept:

1. Find many similar things to measure (e.g., a population of people).
2. There's usually a *ton* of those things, so figure out how many of that thing to measure to give it [scientific rigor](/science/) without wasting too much time or money on it.
3. Pile up that information until it shows a bell curve across a numbered range.
4. Calculate the center of that bell curve, then determine where most of those things sit from that center. Typically, over half of everything will fit within 1 standard deviation, and about 95% will fit inside two of them.
