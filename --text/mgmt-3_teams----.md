Realistic job previews have been shown to reduce turnover even when they
are given after the employee is hired.

They're helping all people cope better when they confront the inevitable
difficulties of the role.

For most jobs, it takes from three weeks to three months after a candidate starts to determine true competency.

During the first _____ days, identify the key resources needs to accomplish this, evaluate actual status against existing plans, and revise and implement as necessary to achieve the planned goals.

One of our key technically oriented objectives is manage the [implementation, launch, design, development of] __________. Over the next _________ months, we must [complete, identify, plan, define resource needs] to ensure achieving planned results.

During the first ____ days, prepare a strategic plan outlining all the needs of the department to meet the company's long-term objective of _________ From this, prepare a calendar-based monthly operating budget and implementation plan by _________ [date].

The best people consistently deliver more results than expected, and they do it on time, all the time. This separates the best from everyone else.

New hires at Zappos go through a week of training. Then, at the end of those seven days, Hsieh makes them an offer. If they feel Zappos isn't for them and want to leave, he'll pay them $2,000 - no hard feelings. Hsieh is hacking the Motivation 2.0 operating system like a brilliant and benevolent teenage computer whiz. He's using an "if-then" reward not to motivate people to perform better, but to weed out those who aren't fit for a Motivation 3.0-style workplace.

After a job candidate has worked a thirty-day trial period on a team, the prospective teammates vote on whether to hire that person full-time. At W. L. Gore & Associates, the makers of the GORE-TEX fabric and another example of Motivation 3.0 in action, anybody who wants to rise in the ranks and lead a team must assemble people willing to work with him.

People working in self-organized teams are more satisfied than those working in inherited teams.

People want to be accountable - and that making sure they have control over their task, their time, their technique, and their team is a pathway to that destination.
- this is dependent on the conscientiousness aspect of personality

## diversity

Odd people and ordinary people get a co-dependent kick out of being needed and liked by each other.

If you're going to be an entrepreneur, be prepared to work with people who not only don't follow the rutted path of the masses but openly shun it. After all, that's why these people are willing to listen to you and your fundamentally innovative ideas in the first place.

In working with odd people, you are in for some serious challenges. But you're also in for some serious treats. These are the smartest, most interesting people on the planet, and the fact that they are willing to give your ordinary B-getting ass the time of day should flatter you.

## hiring

If someone gives you more than one reason why he wants the job, don't
hire him.

Only hire someone you wouldn't mind sitting next to on a plane ride
across the country.

## HR

If you are good with people and enjoy helping them resolve conflicts and issues, you might consider becoming an HR specialist. HR stands for Human Resources.

Human resources management is recruiting talents and developing a solid company's workforce. The HR department identifies skills or human resources in a company, evaluates potential candidates, and hires talent. They are also in charge of advertising a position for a company.

An HR specialist screens, recruits, interviews, and places new employees.

Other HR responsibilities include:
- Handling employee relations
- Handling payroll
- Managing benefits and training for employees
- Consulting with executives on strategic planning

HR is there to serve the COMPANY'S interests
- since a manager is generally harder to replace and often paid more, HR will usually protect the manager over the employee
- however, once a manager becomes too large a risk (or redundant), they'll be there to get rid of that manager
- stay upfront with your charges about this fact, and everyone will respect you more
