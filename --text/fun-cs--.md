Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.

To understand what recursion is, you must first understand recursion.

There are 10 types of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who have regular sex.

Unix is user friendly. It’s just very particular about who its friends are.

Two bytes meet. The first byte asks, “Are you ill?” The second byte replies, “No, just feeling a bit off.”

Documentation is like sex. When it’s good, it’s very good. When it’s bad, it’s better than nothing.

Saying Java is good because it works on all operating systems is like saying anal sex is good because it works on all genders.
