## blender

DIFFICULT BUT AWESOME:
Blender is this for 3D design. Completely unintuitive and follows none of the layout, keystroke or workflow conventions of other 3D design software; the most enthusiastic proponents will agree the learning curve is vertical. Anyone who masters it will swear by it, and always come back to use it even if they own commercial software suites. The interface and the ability to customize your UI lets a user get fairly close to an Autodesk layout.
