The business plan should come AFTER you have a legitimate dream in mind
- The business plan is the easy part: it's just unpacking what already exists that you built in your mind

Ray Ozzie:
Before I start a company, I write a couple of founding documents:
1. outside-in : scenario-based describing the high-level challenge I'm trying to address and the end-user scenarios we're trying to solve
2. bottom-up : describing the different technologies that will have to be assembled to accomplish this mission
Companies take their shape based on the personality characteristics and human interaction characteristics of the founders.

Tim Brady:
Do as much thinking up-front about what your breaking points are. Why am I getting in? When do I leave? What gets me up in the morning? What could happen to make me stop getting up in the morning?

Too many startup business plans look more like they are planning to launch a rocket ship than drive a car. They prescribe the steps to take and the results to expect in excruciating detail, and as in planning to launch a rocket, they are set up in such a way that even tiny errors in assumptions can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

The customers failed to materialize, the company had committed itself so completely that they could not adapt in time. They had "achieved failure" - successfully, faithfully, and rigorously executing a plan that turned out to have been utterly flawed.

Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Through this process of steering, we can learn when and if it's time to make a sharp turn called a pivot or whether we should persevere along our current path.

There is no such thing as a great start-up, because every startup can be improved upon.
And most of the improvement happens between the first incarnation of a company and the tenth.
Maybe by then, the company might well be considered great.
And that is precisely the moment by which all of the true entrepreneurs will have left the building.

Project Mercury and Tripod are good.
NASA and General Electric are great.
Start-ups are no place for greatness; leave that to the large, established companies.
If your idea is big enough, and crazy enough, all you have to do is survive. If you survive, you will succeed.

## borrow from elsewhere

borrow as much as you can from others. Don't look for out-of-the-box solutions. Find other people who are either doing what you want to do or doing pieces of your plan. Nothing is so new that someone hasn't already mastered parts of it.

Nine times out of ten, someone has already solved the puzzle you are flummoxed over.

## business model

There's a very specific business model for dealerships and insurance
1. do [cust svc] load for multiple providers
2. Have a quota with those providers
3. Public-facing reputation shared between you and them
4. Back-end, you're still unrelated entities

## buying

A product bought right is a product half sold

## cofounder

Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together.

## competitive advantage

There are really only three sustainable competitive advantages:
1. Supply. A company has this edge when it controls an important resource: A company may have a proprietary technology that is protected by a patent.
2. Demand. A company can control a market because customers are loyal to it, either out of habit - to a brand name, for example - or because the cost of switching to a different product is too high.
3. Economies of scale. If your operating costs remain fixed while output increases, you can gain a significant edge because you can offer your product at lower cost without sacrificing profit margins.
    Having a superior competitive advantage of handsome retained earnings, a fine business selling in the market place for less than intrinsic value, should repurchase its shares at this lower market price.

One question I always ask myself in appraising a business is how I would like, assuming I had ample capital and skilled personnel, to compete with it.

Say bread ingredients cost $1.95.
The baker who charges $2 a loaf has to sell twenty-one loaves for every loaf the luxury baker sells at $3.
Twenty-one times as many is the difference between a few customers an hour or a line out the door.
"But our customers would prefer to pay the lower price."?
Perhaps. But how do they value the sparkling clean shop, with plenty of well-paid and helpful staff, a new sign in the window, and a local baseball team with new jerseys with your logo on them? How do they value the handsome shopping bag that comes with every loaf, not to mention the free samples of the little butter cookies you call punitions?
How does it make them feel to tell their friends that they're eating the same bread that's served at the fancy restaurant down the street?
Better to apologize for the price once than to have to excuse a hundred small slights again and again.
- this is only true SOMETIMES
- other times, you want the product at scale, meaning you don't really care about a high-quality image
- the advantage in THAT situation is that they tell their friends that it's the cheapest bread in town

- indicate how its business model is NOT driven by profit, and that "goodwill" or "charity" is a great way to get public attention on it
- it's the reason why groups like Airbnb, Uber, and others can signal "woke" and get away with terrible actions
- Signaling, however, works because it dupes people into thinking you care about the community
