### Ethics (from Matt Levine)

U.S. public companies generally have codes of ethics, which they make public. A company's code of ethics says that its executives and employees are supposed to act ethically, sets some guidelines about what counts as ethical or unethical behavior, and has some procedures to enforce those guidelines.

Why do companies have codes of ethics? Part of the answer is that the code of ethics is a management tool. The company's directors and officers want its employees to act ethically, for whatever reason (personal morality, management of legal and reputational risk, etc.). So they have a set of policies telling employees what not to do, and the employees read the policies and know what not to do, and if they do it the company can fire them.

Another part of the answer is that the code of ethics is an advertising tool. "We are an ethical company, see, we have a code of ethics," the company can say, to potential shareholders or customers or employees. And then those potential shareholders or customers or employees can read the code and say "oh yes you are ethical" and support the ethical companies and avoid the unethical ones.

A third, most obvious part of the answer is that having and publicizing a code of ethics is essentially required by law. U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission rules](https://www.sec.gov/rule-release/33-8177) created after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require a public company "to disclose whether it has adopted a code of ethics that applies" to its senior officers, and, if not, explain why not; the rules also require the company to make the code of ethics public. In theory I suppose you could just about satisfy this requirement by adopting a code of ethics that says "we will try to act ethically when appropriate" and leaving it at that, or by publicly disclosing "we do not have a code of ethics because we generally trust our senior officers to act ethically when appropriate," but I feel like you'd get some pushback for either of those approaches. Also listing standards for the stock exchanges have further requirements for codes of ethics, including that they apply to employees (not just senior officers) and contain an enforcement mechanism; saying "we don't have a code of ethics and here's why" is not an option under these rules.

So if you are a public company you have to write a code of ethics and make it public, and it has to be good enough to meet your listing requirements. But those requirements are pretty general and leave a lot of room for different approaches. So you might ask, in writing a code of ethics: How good should it be? Should it require your employees to be just barely ethical enough, or should it hold them to a very high standard?

There are obvious reasons to make the standards high and specific. As a management tool, there are advantages to telling your employees to be very ethical: That will minimize legal and reputational risk, plus it is, you know, the ethical thing to do. As an advertising tool, the advantages are even more obvious: If you are trying to impress shareholders with your code of ethics, you will impress them more if it's very ethical.

This last point is particularly salient these days as so many investors are focused on environmental, social and governance issues; having a good code of ethics is a good way to respond to ESG investors' demands. If your investors say "we care about diversity," you can say "so do we, see, our code of ethics says that everyone has to respect diversity," and the investors will be happy. The SEC requires you to tell shareholders about your code of ethics, so you might as well use the opportunity to tell the shareholders what they want to hear.

But there are also obvious reasons to make the standards low and generic. As a management tool, for instance, sometimes you might want to have the flexibility to prioritize profits over ethics. (Not _you_, of course, but someone might!) Also, if you have very high ethical standards, sometimes your employees might violate them, and then what? It is all well and good to write on a piece of paper "we have zero tolerance for lying," but then when your extremely effective head of sales gets caught in a little lie do you have to fire her?

But the biggest problem with a strict and specific code of ethics is that [everything is securities fraud](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-03/goldman-sachs-goes-to-supreme-court-hedge-funds-won-on-gamestop-kkpoe6ws). If someone at your company does something bad and the stock goes down, your shareholders will sue, claiming in essence that you didn't tell them that you were doing the bad thing. Technically, though, securities law does not require companies to disclose every bad thing; for the most
part it penalizes active lies, not passive omissions. So the shareholders will not say "you didn't tell us about the bad thing"; rather, they will say "you actively lied to us, saying or implying that you were not doing the bad thing." Codes of ethics [are _very helpful_ to the shareholder plaintiffs here](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-01/it-doesn-t-pay-to-be-too-ethical), meaning that they are dangerous for the company, and the more strict and detailed they are the more dangerous they are. If your code of
ethics says "executives are expected to act ethically where appropriate," and your chief executive officer is revealed to be a sexual harasser and the stock drops, you can say "well that vague statement couldn't possibly have induced anyone to buy our stock" and maybe win the shareholder lawsuit. If your code of ethics says "we have zero tolerance for sexual harassment of any kind and we hold everyone
accountable immediately," then it will be easier for shareholders to argue that they were deceived.

The last few years in the financial markets have involved (1) a huge growth in the size and salience of ESG investing and (2) a huge growth in the volume and creativity of everything-is-securities-fraud lawsuits, which kind of cut in opposite directions. You could imagine companies _paring down_ their codes of ethics to avoid getting sued all the time, or _beefing up_ their codes to seek favor with ESG investors.

But there is an actual answer, which is "beefing up":

> Over the past decade, corporate scandals have proliferated. These scandals, along with the emergence of the #MeToo movement and Environmental,
> Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) mandates, have increased the
> scrutiny of corporations' ethics culture. How have companies responded

That is the abstract to "[How Have Corporate Codes of Ethics Responded to an Era of Increased Scrutiny?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3887743)"
by Tim Loughran, Bill McDonald and James Otteson. The point I want to
make here is that beefing up your corporate code of ethics is _costly_, and in some loose sense _binding:_
The more things that are clearly prohibited by your code of ethics, the
more likely you are to get sued if someone does them. If your code of
ethics says "we will not use slavery" and you use slavery you will
definitely, definitely get sued!

And
companies are incurring these costs. Possibly out of, like, intrinsic
corporate morality, but I'm not a big believer in intrinsic corporate
morality. More likely it is because shareholders, loosely speaking,
demand that they have these policies, and so the companies are doing
what shareholders want. And because everything is securities fraud,
if companies don't follow those codes, the shareholders can sue. In some
rough and approximate sense, shareholders have found a binding way to
make companies more ethical.

Honestly that's all you need to know, but the details are pretty good too. From the April 1 story:

> Industry veteran Beat Zaugg, who has been an owner of Scott Sports since 1998, says he remains the brand's CEO, a minority shareholder and chairman of its parent company board, despite a news release Friday saying that the board had fired him.
> 
> "This announcement was made to destabilize the company and its employees," Zaugg told BRAIN on Monday; he said the announcement had been made via a PR agency that works for Scott's majority shareholder — Korea's Youngone — not Scott Sports. …
> 
> However, the PR firm responded to BRAIN later on Monday with a statement from the Scott Corporation board insisting that Youngone representatives have a majority on the board and had voted to terminate Zaugg.
> 
> "We understand that it may be difficult for Mr. Zaugg to accept his termination (given his long-standing role as CEO). But this is ultimately irrelevant as a matter of law: the ultimate decision body of a company is the board of directors and the board is clearly entitled to terminate the employment with the CEO," the statement read in part. …
> 
> Zaugg conceded that Youngone controls a majority of the board, but said the board did not terminate him correctly. "So far they did it wrong," he told BRAIN, without elaborating. "This has to be my secret for the time being," he said.  

Every dispute of this kind has a paragraph like that: Generally the dispute is between the majority shareholder and the chief executive officer, and the CEO can't usually deny that (1) the majority shareholder owns a majority of the shares and (2) that ultimately gives them the power to fire him. So the CEO is reduced to saying "well, sure they _could_ fire me, but they have to follow proper procedures, and they forgot to send the notice of the board meeting by registered mail so nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah here I still am." Usually the CEO stands on some minor, debatable point of procedure. This is the first time I've seen a CEO stand on a _secret_ point of procedure. I like this guy's style.

Also the April 4 story contains a tantalizing hint that the Swiss police might _regularly_ be involved in disputes like this:

> Fribourg police spokesperson Bertrand Ruffieux told Euro Day France: "Nothing serious happened. We intervened in a civil matter, a dispute between managers. In this type of case, the police are called to the scene to find a way to open a discussion, and for people to understand each other. But there are no injured or anyone arrested."

Like you call the Swiss police and the Corporate Disputes Unit shows up with sirens blaring and they get out the bullhorn and shout "we have a copy of your bylaws right here! Don't do anything rash! A quorum of your board of directors is on the way!"
