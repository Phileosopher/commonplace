libertarianism and democracy are both impossible in their purest forms simply because ppl don't care enough

- democracy won't work because some people will (delegate their vote to "experts"){specialization}, which will devolve into choosing (factions)
- libertarianism won't work because people will eventually give their (power) away for the sake of (safety)
