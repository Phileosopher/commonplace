Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
[1 Corinthians 12:3 Therefore I inform you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm)

- this is basically an ironclad litmus test:
  - if it's a prophetic vision, look for the symbols
  - if it's a seer or fortuneteller divining rod or ANYTHING like that, ask it that question
- "Is Jesus cursed?"
- "Is Jesus Lord?"
- easy way to winnow it
