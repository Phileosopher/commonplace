## Website structure

Websites, and by extension "social media", have degrees of complexity:

1. The most basic website simply conveys information by a single user or group (e.g., this site).
2. The data may become more complex than text and allow [images](engineering-camera.md), [videos](engineering-camera.md), and [audio recordings](computers-speakersmic.md).
3. When the site provides any public forum for discussion, it becomes "user-driven" (e.g., a comments thread).
4. Some sites are almost entirely user-made content, and are often called "wikis".
5. If each user gets the freedom to make their own custom content, it's a "profile page" system.
6. The user may also have a "feed" that allows that user to present constantly updated, date-sorted data.
7. Each element of data might give the user freedom to constrain [permissions](computers-cysec-authentication.md) for which users (or unidentified computer users) can access the information.
8. Users may have the freedom to make comments on other users' information.
9. The comments system may be enhanced so heavily that the users can centralize it on a topic, which is often called a "forum".
10. The users may grant shared permissions with one another, with some demarcated relationship (e.g, friend, connection, buddy, etc.).
11. Finally, "recommender systems" can recommend portions of relevant users' data to other users.

In practice, the core of social media has distilled to several website categories:

- Blog - mostly static content by a single user or group, sometimes allowing comments (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/)).
- Wiki - mostly static content by many users, but only allowing edits and not comments (e.g., [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com/)).
- Content showcase - a media-based network that showcases specific, topic-based content (e.g., [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)).
- Forum - constantly updating content by many users, organized by topic (e.g, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/)).
- Feed - constantly updating content by many users, typically algorithmically sorted (e.g., [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)).
- Online Store - content that users can update for the purpose of selling merchandise (e.g., [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/)).

- it's easy to frame a system that enhances base human motivations

The Problem with Subs
1. [thing] becomes popular and lots of non-[thing] followers join the most popular sub.
2. The dumbest, most not-worthy-to-talk-about-[thing] people exercise their
    voice without any sense of responsibility. Some of them become mods.
3. The original enthusiasts leave to another sub where the legitimate talk goes on.
This is a product of:
- No vetting process for people to speak freely
- No prioritization of veterans of the interest

Conversations
- People tend to have an idea flow:
    1. Stated idea/post/video/original_content
    2. Commenter makes good points
    3. Conversation get sidelined to whatever the best comments were
    4. Repeat #2 indefinitely until people lose interest
