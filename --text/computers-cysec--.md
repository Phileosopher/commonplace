NOTE: will connect to other non-TS page?

Privacy and complete freedom are inversely connected
- if everyone has privacy, there's the opportunity for injustice
- if everyone has freedom, there's technically no privacy
 
article on how there needs to be a tech version of attorney/client, doctor/patient privilege
- basically, there's too much [power] in the hands of these geeks that there must be a legally bound implicit standardized agreement
- without this, any random person can steal any information they want because copying computer information is EASIER than moving it

## Amazon message

## FROM AMAZON

## Protect yourself from scammers

#### Be careful installing apps or software

Amazon will not ask you to install an app or download software in order to receive a refund or to get help from customer service.

#### Never pay over the phone

Amazon will not ask you to provide payment information, including gift cards (or "verification cards," as some scammers call them), for products or services over the phone.

#### Always verify orders directly with Amazon

Amazon will not include purchased product information in order confirmation and shipping confirmation emails we send to customers. For any questions related to an order, always check [Your Orders](https://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?C=KXX8UEOO2L0J&K=12GHWUZNHA36N&M=urn:rtn:msg:20230413213300bbdfeb49664147aa8b32ef065840p0na&R=3UD0C6AQLG944&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fcss%2Forder-history%3Fref_%3Dpe_49013300_706024580_nav_orders_first&H=EODT2YJH4DW99CV5BQNO53EAEJOA&ref_=pe_49013300_706024580_nav_orders_first) on Amazon.com or via the "Amazon Shopping" app.

#### Be wary of false urgency

Amazon will not pressure you to act now. Scammers may try to create a sense of urgency to persuade you to do what they're asking.

If you receive communication - a call, text, or email - that you think may not be from Amazon, please report it to us at [amazon.com/reportascam](https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=KXX8UEOO2L0J&K=12GHWUZNHA36N&M=urn:rtn:msg:20230413213300bbdfeb49664147aa8b32ef065840p0na&R=3CL2RENF6CPXL&T=C&U=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freportascam%3Fref_%3Dpe_49013300_706024580&H=TTMALS4DNEDP6YNKBG2AYHVE178A&ref_=pe_49013300_706024580)

Scammers are creative and they constantly devise new schemes, exploit new technologies and change tactics to avoid detection. Stay safe by learning to identify and avoid scams.

Prime membership scams: These are unexpected calls/texts/emails that refer to a costly membership fee or an issue with your membership and ask you to confirm or cancel the charge. These scammers try to convince you to provide payment or bank account information in order to reinstate a membership.

Amazon will never ask you to provide payment information for products or services over the phone. Visit the Message Center on Amazon.com or on our app to review authentic emails from Amazon. To verify your Prime Membership status or make payments, log into your Amazon account, and go to Your Account._
Account suspension/Deletion scams: Scammers send texts, emails and phone calls stating that your account will be suspended or deleted and prompt you to click on a fraudulent link or verbally provide information to "verify your account." Customers who land on these pages or receive these phone calls are then lured to provide account information such as payment information or account login credentials.
Amazon will never ask you to disclose your password or verify sensitive personal information over the phone or on any website other than Amazon.com. Please do not click on any links or provide your information to anyone over the phone without authenticating the email or phone call. If you have questions about the status of your account, go directly to Amazon.com or on our app to view your account details, including the Message Center which displays a log of communications sent from Amazon._
Here are some important tips to identify scams and keep your account and information safe:
1. Trust Amazon-owned channels. Always go through the Amazon mobile app or website when seeking customer service, tech support, or when looking to make changes to your account.
2. Be wary of false urgency. Scammers may try to create a sense of urgency to persuade you to do what they're asking. Be wary any time someone tries to convince you that you must act now.
3. Never pay over the phone. Amazon will never ask you to provide payment information, including gift cards (or "verification cards," as some scammers call them) for products or services over the phone.
4. Verify links first. Legitimate Amazon websites contain "amazon.com" or "amazon.com/support." Go directly to our website when seeking help with Amazon devices/services, orders or to make changes to your account.|

## Cybersecurity - Matt Levine

### Good honeypot

The internet [tells me](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/politics/classified-information-what-matters/index.html) that there are about 1.2 million people in the US with top secret security clearance. You could imagine a sort of cool spy-movie world in which "top secret" secrets were really top secret and only shared with a few, carefully vetted, highly trustworthy people. But at 1.2 million people, nah. At 1.2 million people, even if your vetting process is 99.99% reliable, you will still have 120 people who forget their top secret documents on the train, or leave their top secret laptops open at the coffee shop while they go to the bathroom, or have loud top secret phone conversations in public places, or are actual spies for the other side. At 1.2 million people, no matter how good your vetting is, the far left tail of the trustworthiness distribution is going to be [this guy](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/air-force-employee-indicted-unlawful-disclosure-classified-national-defense-information):

> A civilian employee of the U.S. Air Force assigned to the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), at Offutt Air Force Base, was arrested Saturday, March 2, for allegedly conspiring to transmit and transmitting classified information relating to the national defense (National Defense Information or NDI) on a foreign online dating platform beginning in or around February 2022 until in or around April 2022.
> 
> According to the indictment, David Franklin Slater, 63, of Nebraska, worked in a classified space at USSTRATCOM and held a Top Secret security clearance from in or around August 2021 until in or around April 2022, after retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel from the U.S. Army. It is alleged that Slater willfully, improperly, and unlawfully transmitted NDI classified as "SECRET," which he had reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation, on a foreign online dating platform to a person not authorized to receive such information.

Yes, somewhere out there, there will inevitably be a guy who (1) has a top secret security clearance and (2) will hand out military secrets to impress obviously fake partners on an online dating site. Allegedly Slater got classified briefings about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and he had a fake online girlfriend "who claimed to be a female living in Ukraine on the foreign dating website." From [the indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1340961/dl?inline):

> Co-Conspirator 1 [the fake girlfriend] regularly asked DAVID FRANKLIN SLATER to provide her with sensitive, non-public, closely held, and classified NDI, to which DAVID FRANKLIN SLATER had access as a result of his employment with the United States Air Force. For example, Co-Conspirator 1 stated in 2022: …
> 
> On or about March 11, "Dear, what is shown on the screens in the special room?? It is very interesting." …
> 
> On or about March 15, … "You are my secret informant love! How were your meetings? Successfully?"
> 
> On or about March 18, "Beloved Dave, do NATO and Biden have a secret plan to help us?" ...
> 
> On or about April 12, "Sweet Dave, the supply of weapons is completely classified, which is great!"

Did he ever worry that maybe she only loved him for his top secret information and not for his sparkling personality? Did he care? How could this possibly have worked? Well, it only had to work on one guy.
