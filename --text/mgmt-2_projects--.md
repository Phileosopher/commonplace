Project management. The variables are budget, schedule, and scope. You can fix only two of those variables at a time. If you have a fixed cost and timeline, you cannot know how much you can accomplish. If you know what to do and how much you can spend, you won't know how long it will take. If you have a schedule and a well-defined task, you will not know how much it will cost.

In desktops, there's performance, quality, and price. You can only pick two. In laptops, there's performance, battery life, and price. Again, you can only pick two.

Every engineering project has to choose between the two of three: how fast you can get it down, how cheaply you can do it, and how good the quality of the object is.

Managers use Project/program management Agile tools like Trello and Jira

The system is ALWAYS more complicated than it looks, and you can blame great UX for that

Project Managmeent Triangle:

- Cost - how affordable the item is
- Time - how fast the customer can receive the product
- Quality - how reliable, effective, and great the product is
- High-quality of all three is impossible, so professionals have to choose two they prefer to provide

It's better to be an octopus than a fish. If an octopus loses a tentacle
to a predator, the octopus will survive with seven tentacles left to
fend for itself, and perhaps a few lessons learned that will enable it
to avoid another such attack. If a fish loses a fin - or worse, its tail
it's unlikely to fare as well and its survival will be questionable.
So use the Octopus Business Model. Create non-cross-collateralized
sections and/or businesses - which means that the cost of running a
section of your business, and the potential profit of that business,
should be self-contained, and not "cross over" to the other businesses.

In any dynamic system, the initial conditions have a huge influence over
what happens.

A firm is successful when the costs of directing employee effort are lower than the potential gain from directing.

pick any two ...

goals - purposes you want
strategies - big paths to those goals
tactics - specific primitives of strategies
techniques - specific primitives of tactics
