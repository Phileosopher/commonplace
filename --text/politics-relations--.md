Realism vs liberalism vs isolationism?

FROM HN:
The ICC has actually only ever prosecuted Africans (and recently issued a couple of warrants against Russians). But The ICC, The ICTY and the IMT/IMTFE all have essentially the same authority when it comes to enforcing “international law”, which is none at all. International laws aren’t real, there is no international government, international police or international armed forces. All international legal or military actions take place only with the voluntary cooperation of all countries involved. If any country decides to withhold that cooperation on any particular issue, then there is no enforcement mechanism. Which is why all of history’s “international courts” have only ever prosecuted the losers of wars.

an international court is absurd, since it would require conformity to a singular worldview that all cultures would be willing to sign off on
- this sounds nice, but is logistically impossible, partly from [religion], partly from [language] barriers, and partly from simple ways of doing things
