You Were Not Meant For Marriage
If sex doesn’t matter to you, marriage isn’t for you. In marriage, sex is not optional - it’s core. If you don’t want sex, seek support from friends and relatives, and consider adopting children.
If you want to keep your money separate, stay single. Marriage is a shared vision, shared wallet, and shared sacrifice. You can’t pay bills like roommates and expect the full rewards of marriage. 
If you love your parents and children more than your spouse, marriage will feel like a burden. Your partner must come first. If not, live with your parents and raise your children there.
If you can’t listen, stay alone. Marriage is not ruled by one voice. It’s built by two humble hearts that listen to each other. Know-it-alls depress their partner. Humility holds love together.
If you’re not correctable, stay single. If you can’t say “I’m sorry,” you can’t live with anyone. Marriage is not for the proud. Marriage is for people who own up their mistakes and apologize. 
Dr. K. N. Jacob
