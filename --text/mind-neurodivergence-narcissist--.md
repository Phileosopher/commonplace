what they do when confronted

1 deny everything

their core persona is rooted in denial
a survival strategy that pushes reality out
they swap reality for the delusional fantasy of themselves

2 attack

a fight-fawn response
they can be very charming, giving, and codependent, but then they switch and can become aggressive and attack
they learned from early childhood that attack is the best form of offense
the frailty of their boundaries means that an assertion of facts is outside what they have decreed
they will experience a "narcissistic injury"
they will make a response that is disproportionate to it, through "narcissistic rage"

3 switch reality around and re-presenting it
aka RVO "reverse victim and offender"
