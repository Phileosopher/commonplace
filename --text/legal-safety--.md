HOW TO SUE
it pays, more than anything else, to:
1. know the judge or a close associate of the judge
2. know good lawyers personally
3. know the region's laws and requirements

it's typically "pay to play", with typically the following goals:
- in a civil case, it's "balance of probabilities", meaning you must prove the highest likelihood that you deserve the damages/settlement/money
- in a criminal case, it's "beyond reasonable doubt", meaning you must prove that there's reasonable doubt that you could have done the thing you're charged with
- in a divorce case, you want no-fault if you want a clean break down the middle, and at-fault if seeking damages (which works like a civil case at that point)

LEGAL FLOW:
Complaint/charge
  Resolve with settlement
Discovery
Deliberation
Decision/judgment
Sentencing, goes to Enforcement
