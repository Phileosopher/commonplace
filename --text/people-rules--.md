1880: A lady shouldn't have more than one glass of champagne.
The British manual, The Habits of Good Society: A Handbook of Etiquette for Ladies and Gentlemen, says that a proper lady should only accept one glass of champagne — anything more or less would be improper.

1880: Women should always wear their hair up.
A woman was expected to look fresh, polished, and composed for her husband at all times. In Victorian terms, that meant her hair must be worn up, except when in the privacy of her bed chamber.

1880: A lady never carries her dress with two hands.
When crossing the street, it was expected that a lady would carry her dress in her right hand, lifted outward to the right. This method ensured that only the appropriate amount of ankle was exposed.

1890: Women should only give handmade gifts.
The Victorian rules around courting were especially bizarre, but none more than the era's gift etiquette between a couple. A woman could only give a man a gift if he gives her one first — and even then women should only reciprocate with inexpensive or handmade gifts.

1890: Never ask a direct question.
Victorians found it incredibly rude to ask a direct question. Instead of asking someone, "How are you doing?" a polite person would reword the question to something along the lines of "I hope you're doing well."

1900: Children should never contradict.
One of the many rules a child was expected to follow in the age of being seen and not heard is to keep your opinions to yourself. It was considered disagreeable for a child to contradict anyone, for ANY reason.

1900: Calling cards are to be left by women.
Calling cards were used in the Victoria era to let a friend or family member know you visited them while they weren't home. Of course, these cards came with myriad rules to follow, including that it was primarily the woman's job to leave the cards.

1910: Refrain from impure thoughts — especially if pregnant.
The purity of thoughts was a big thing during the Victorian era, but even in 1910 parenting experts lead mothers to believe that it was their ugly thoughts that lead to conditions like colic — and an old wives tale said that refraining from said thoughts would lead to a beautiful baby.

1915: Wedding guests must bring admittance cards.
It wasn't necessary to RSVP to an invitation, but couples who held ceremonies in the city WOULD send out cards that gained guests admittance to the church on their big day.

1930s: Women should use flowers to attract men.
A few handy tips for college-bound women were shared in a 1938 issue of Mademoiselle, like have your mom send flowers to your dorm room so that your male peers will think you are in demand. The magazine also suggested turning off the lights in your room at night so that people will think you aren't at home … even if you are.

1940s: Proper hair care requires excessive brushing.
It was recommended for women to put in at least 100 strokes a night, for a "shining halo," and keep brushing "until your scalp tingles," according to the 1944 etiquette book, Future Perfect: A Guide to Personality and Popularity for the Junior Miss.

1940s: A lady shouldn't be able to 'hold her liquor.'
According to Vogue's 1948 Book of Etiquette, the ability to have more than a few drinks was not a good thing back in the day. As the book claims, "She can certainly hold her liquor is not a compliment." So does that mean a woman should refrain from drinking or should she just hide how much she's actually drinking from those around her?

1940s: The salt and pepper must remain together.
Separating the salt from the pepper is a big etiquette no-no. Instead, one should pass the two spices as a couple, even if the person asked for just one.

1940s: You should smile when talking on the phone.
The phone was a relatively new form of technology in the 1940s. According to expert Bernice Morgan Bryant, proper phone etiquette meant speaking clearly into the phone and adding a smile (even though they can't see you). People should also "never bark into the phone" with phrases like "Who is it?" or "Whadja want?"

1950s: The man is expected to order a woman's food in public.
It was typical for men to help women into the car, put on their coat, and even order a woman's meal when at a restaurant. We don't call that chivalry, it sounds more like over controlling.

1950s: The host always serves the meat.
In a house without a maid (gasp), guests should look to the host to serve the meat, and then pass along each plate to the guest seated to their right until everyone is served, according to Emily Post.

1950s: Cut asparagus in half before eating it.
Traditionally, the vegetable was known in British society as finger food. However, in Emily Post's 1975 revision of her etiquette book, she suggests cutting your stalk in half before picking it up to avoid, "the ungraceful appearance of a bent stalk of asparagus falling limply into someone's mouth and the fact that moisture is also likely to drip from the end."
