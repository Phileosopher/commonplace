### conveying ideas

Any software system should be able to be guided by an appropriate
metaphor. For instance, a payroll system might be considered analogous
to a post office, with discrete mailboxes, delivery schedules, and so
on. All metaphors break down eventually, but the idea was that a
sufficiently rich metaphor could help guide the design of a system and
help answer questions that come up during development.

Why do we insert something into a container instead of add it?
Programmers are sloppy in their use of metaphors - such as "tables".

### rules

Make a rule book that no person will NOT have violated
That way, you can throw the book at the 3-10 percent of deviants who try to destroy and get away with it

What is the internet, then? Libertarian? The internet champions and enables personal liberty.

The internet not as left, right, or libertarian bus as the connection machine that brings together any and all worldviews.

The internet doesn't make us more creative. Instead, it enables what we create to be seen, heard, and used. It enables every creator to find a public.

That takes creation out of the proprietary hands of the supposed creative class. Curmudgeons argue that they rob the creative class of its financial support and exclusivity: its pedestal.

The internet lets us find people who like what we do.

The internet kills the mass: mass economics and mass media.

Curmudgeons argue that it's flooded with crap. Only the playing field is flat. To stand out, one must rise on worth - as is defined by the public, rather than the priests - and the reward is attention.

We want to create and we want to be generous with our creations. We will get the attention we deserve. That means crap will be ignored. It just depends on your definition of crap.

- it's important to note how transparency can VERY heavily affect the people there

### transparency - the new attitude

The more you control, the less you will be trusted. The more you hand over control, the more trust you will earn.

The powerful must learn to trust the public.

We still need editors, curators, teachers to find and nurture the best.

Traditionalists suggest we throw out the internet baby with the bathwater. One nasty comment, one hoax, and they try to use that to discredit the entirety of a service as a whole.

Corrections enhance credibility. Standing up and admitting your errors makes you more believable. It gives your audience faith that you will right your future wrongs.

The worst mistake is to act as if you don't make mistakes.

Blog about your plans and decisions. Join in human conversations with customers. Ask people what you should do.

Your competitive advantage is not that your designs are secret, but that you have a strong relationship with your community of customers.

Companies should be meritocracies.

Speed is a strategic necessity. Adjust to customers' actions and desires quickly. Learn from them and stay ahead of them.

Holding back products and popping them out as surprises insults your customers (unless you're Apple). The earlier they're involved with the process, the better.

Beware any strategy built on protection from cannibalization, for it probably means the cannibals are at the door and ready to eat you for lunch.

Cash flow can blind you to the strategic necessity of change, though decisions, and innovation.

Approach innovation in that order: first find the problem, then create the solution. Beware the cool idea.

Design is about more than aesthetics. Design is an ethic. Design is the path by which you interact with your public. Magazines, clothes, and cars aren't the only things that are designed. Companies are designed. Services are designed. Rules are designed.
The simpler and clearer the design, the better. To be simple is to be direct. To be direct is to be honest.

If you make a great platform, the worst thing you could do is to put yourself in the middle, getting in the way of what people want to do with it.

Make something useful. Help people use it. Then get out of the way.

### transparency - the new economy

Umar Haque's bubblegeneration.com blog has influenced Chris Anderson and me. He says media 2.0's three sources of value creation are:
- revelation (finding the good stuff)
- aggregation (distribution 2.0)
- plasticity (enabling content to be extended like mashups)

Release information bottlenecks and make things more liquid.

Stop trying to make money by interfering in transactions.

What if your goods cost you nothing?
What if you charged nothing?
Where does your value exist?
What is the essence of your business?
What can you learn from it?
How do you make money - is there a side door?

The internet is a great big race to free. Anyone who has built a business model with a price above free for something that can be free is in a tough strategic position. So how do you get to free first?

### foss workers

Corporate FOSS team composition:
Package maintaners - manage the software, get veto/approval power, often full-time thereabouts and work on the thing the corporation/university wants maintained
industry contributors - writes large sections of the code the package maintainers didn't write, relative to their preferences and involving huge swathes of code, paid for a contract or full-time
Individual contributors - bug-fixers, one-off people, pro bono paid
- NOTE: THE SAME GOES FOR CHURCH VOLUNTEERS AS FOSS CONTRIBUTORS

### types of workers

There are 3 major classes of programmer, for the sake of doing work:
1. wet behind the ears, just started working as a professional programmer and need lots of guidance
2. sort of knows what they're doing and can mostly finish tasks on their own
3. experienced, who legitimately know how things work and answer other programmers' questions (NOT necessarily based on title, and most programmers never get here EVER)
    NOTE: this is based on curiosity and interest in the subject more than years experienced

- At #2, you can either become a proper manager or stay on to become #3, and lazy people want #2
    You NEED #3 in the trenches, since some solutions can only come from experience and intuition for things
