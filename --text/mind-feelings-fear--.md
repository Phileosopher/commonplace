Confront Your Fears To Improve Your Life 

As a clinician, I often witnessed the curative in therapy to be truth. This is characteristic of clinical experience and described explicitly by great clinicians. Truth is, indeed, what cures in therapy, and exposure to what you are afraid of and avoiding is a form of truth. If, for example, you know there is a task you should undertake by your own set of rules but you are avoiding it, then you are enacting a lie. 

But if you can face what the task is — and confront what you should not be avoiding — then you engage in the process of attempting to act out your deepest truth. That radically improves people’s lives, the clinical evidence of which is overwhelming. 

If you were to come talk to me about some problems, first of all, you have admitted they exist. That is a good start. Second, if you explain them, we can begin discussing solutions you can then act out to assess if they work. But if you do not admit the problems exist, solutions are not possible. While it might be comfortable moment-to-moment staying encapsulated in a delusion, avoidance ultimately will not work. 

You must practice exposure carefully, cautiously, and voluntarily, but if you are exposed to what you are afraid of and have been avoiding, we know that you get better. Clinicians have established this process as credible. Furthermore, this clinical experience is redemptive because it is designed to address suffering insofar as the people who are engaged in the process tell the truth.
