antisocial behavior is inevitable
- however, it is only a general rule of 3-10% of the culture, unless existing dysfunction has magnified the culture of the group
- managing antisocial behavior, therefore, is a case-by-case basis

one of the most powerful mechanisms to manage antisocial behavior is through setting [rules]
- however, each rule can become Orwellian when applied to EVERYONE
- therefore, only make very specific rules, or change the rules to accommodate everyone's situation

## being a model - being approachable

The best Virgin manager is someone who cares about people and who is genuinely interested and wants to bring out the best in them.

They will earn their colleagues' loyalty and trust, for a start. But just as important, they will make friends.

## being a model - inspirational stories

We aren't in charge : create an environment where other people could have a conversation.

Transform your company into an organization that makes stories.

Given an authentic story that matches our worldview, we'll believe it.
Given the chance to speak up, we'll do just that - loudly and often.

## being a model

As you approach your job each day, ask yourself, "Am I worthy in every
respect of being imitated? Are all my habits such that I would be glad
to see them in my subordinates?"

A great man is one sentence.

At the end of each day, ask yourself whether you were better today than you were yesterday.

Did you learn your ten vocabulary words, make your eight sales calls, eat your five servings of fruits and vegetables, write your four pages?

Give ourselves our own performance reviews. Here's how. Figure out your goals - mostly learning goals, but also a few performance goals - and then every month, call yourself to your office and give yourself an appraisal. How are you faring? Where are you falling short? What tools, information, or support might you need to do better?

When you're newly promoted to manager, MAKE SURE TO ABDICATE SOME OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
- this is especially true for smaller managers and shift supervisors
- you rob the employees of [meaning] when you do their work
- it's great to be an example, but you'll do better to communicate what you want, then get out of the way and hold them accountable to the results
- at the same time, make sure you still do the hard stuff!

Having just one bad apple in a small group can drag down performance by
up to 40 percent.

Great team players change their lifestyle to avoid dysfunctional teams

The most dangerous team dysfunction is in "teams" by name only
- Managers setting goals as opposed to teams setting personal goals to benefit the group
- Team members responsible for only their tasks instead of the team sharing the burden
- Manager assigns tasks to individual members instead of the team as a whole unit
- Most feedback and discussions are solely between the manager and a team member instead of between the members

There are 2 major issues to watch for in censoring bad actors
- Bad originators from leaders
    - This is things like someone making a comment or public expression that doesn't reflect the values of the organization
- Bad responses from followers
    - This is things like comments and smaller discussion that take place IN RESPONSE TO a big statement from a leader

## dysfunction - old tPA

#### Not everyone likes working in a great organization

They must like others' expectations that they seek accomplishment
They have to adapt to the established culture
They need to feel proud to be part of that organization
They have to take an interest in changing everything about their work
They must value clear, open, and honest communication

#### Great members of dysfunctional cultures must do one of a few things

1. Work twice as hard through the necessary bureaucracy to come to the important part of the work
2. Ignore and break completely arbitrary rules they fully know nobody checks and nobody cares about
3. Compromise their values and become part of the problem
4. Leave the system and find a better environment

## maintaining motivation

people are effectively not interested in fixing problems that aren't theirs (e.g., bystander effect)
they DO, however, care about things that disrupt their flow of habits
therefore, to get them to care about a problem they don't care about, make it their problem as well

## remote work

Remote work has pros:
- No rent for office building
- Can recruit a more diverse workforce

Remote work has cons:
- Harder to get everyone on the same page (e.g., conflicts)
- Harder time maintaining morale (they're essentially alone over there MUST MAKE SURE TO HAVE EMERGENCY CONTACT INFO)

remote work is very sticky
It makes sense if there's no good culture to preserve
Tribalknowledge, human interaction etc

Weaker relationships, such as virtual ones, buckle more quickly under
the strain of cultural misundertstandings, and collapse much sooner when
the going gets tough.

Pursue opportunities for virtual interacting:
- hold more virtual meetings that everyone attends
- make sure people identify themselves when they talk on a conference call
- use video-conferencing
- encourage team members to contact each other by phone, not email.
- create a website where you post pictures and personal information
    about team members

the ONLY way to make work-from-home work is to commmunicate in as low-context a style as possible
- this means there's very little room for propriety or politeness
- the natural consequences of this, as well, are that teams will never be as durable long-term, meaning turnover (and training/hiring costs) go up

## worker productivity and happiness

[U.S. workers have gotten way less productive. No one is sure why. - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/31/productivity-down-employers-worried-recession/)
- the first comment is VERY insightful: systems with computers are often too rigid

Google takes to heart the power of exploration. For 20 percent of their
time, employees may go where their mind asks them to go. The proof is in
the bottom line: fully 50 percent of new products, including Gmail and
Google News, came from "20 percent time."
- give time into long projects for people to mess around and play

Sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you're a
manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their
work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler
about it, just ignore them and their efforts.

On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and
for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and
the fruits of their labor.

The personal loyalty that Perot commanded by taking a direct interest in
his employees' lives.
