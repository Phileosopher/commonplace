My marriage had the same breakdown as my dad's and probably everyone's:
1 life is a Shakespeare sonnet
2 life gets rhythmic
3 one partner stops responding the same to something
4 other partner stops initiating
5 the responding partner suspects issues, sex life collapses
6 friction persists until something breaks
7 life is a Greek tragedy

80% of marriage problems can't be fixed, they can only be understood

Marriage is a contract
-shared assets, mostly
-intimacy constraints
-shared descisions on large things
-shared descisions on children
-shared responsibilities

possible clauses
-emotional support
-shared vision
-Desires, subconsious

JORDAN PETERSON
Put Forth Effort In Your Relationship
People tend to think all romantic interaction should be spontaneous. If that is your theory and you are going to get married, you might as well just give up right now. When you are married, especially when you have little kids and you both have a job, you are so busy that the probability you are going to find time for spontaneous mutual interaction decreases to zero. So if that is what you are hoping for, then you are never going to have it. What you have to do is make time for each other. 
When you are dating and establishing the relationship, you put effort into it. You go out for dinner, you dress up to some degree, and you try to present yourself in an acceptable manner. Then, you hope there is going to be a positive consequence, and you are going to find each other attractive. But people somehow think that once they are married, the same amount of effort is not necessary — and that is wrong. In fact, more effort is necessary on the same front. You have to think it through. 
My rule of thumb regarding how much time to spend together each week for the sake of the intimate element of your relationship is derived from clinical observations: You need to spend 90 minutes talking with your partner each week. That means telling each other about your lives, staying in touch so that you each know what the other is up to, discussing what needs to be done to keep the household running smoothly, and laying out some mutually acceptable vision of how the next week or the next months are going to go. 

Archive Conversations
Sometimes we get impatient when we eagerly wait for someone to respond to a message. To help with patience, try archiving the conversation after your last unanswered question. This will help prevent you from being reminded about the lack of response whenever you open the app. Out of sight, out of mind.

Be Positive
Sometimes dating can be frustrated. When you meet someone new, try to make your introductions and descriptions positive. With the sheer number of options people are faced with these days, they won't want to spend time on someone who doesn't seem like they're going to bring happiness into their life right off the bat.

It's only a problem if you make it a problem
Frequently people will lament or worry about traits or habits about themselves that they feel someone else may not like. Weight, height, etc. If the person you're interested in doesn't mention it as an issue, then you shouldn't either. You'll only end up putting a negative opinion into their head when in fact they may have never been thinking about it in the first place.

Patience
People have lives. When someone returns to a conversation, the last thing they'll want is to be greeted by a wall of self-doubting neuroticism when they had no mal-intentions. Remember, try to always be positive.

Facts vs Feelings
Win the fight, lose the relationship
Try to remind yourself about your bigger goal when you're fighting. The point isn't to win the argument, the point is to make the relationship succeed. The best way to accomplish this is to remind yourself what you really want in the relationship, and not just how you feel at that exact moment. Try to deliberately lose the fight as quickly as possible and you'll find both you and your partner will be able to resolve things more easily.

number one indicator of divorce:
- they're calmly speaking with each other, but they're tense (i.e., they're speaking to self-protect, NOT to build any sort of relationship)

every person in a relationship will eventually find MANY irritating little things about their partner

we are taught the wrong thing: that love is meant to be the perfect merger of two lives
- live in the same house
- eat the same meals together
- go to bed and get up at the same time
- only have sex with (or even sexual thoughts) about each other
- frequently see each other's families
- have all their friends in common
- think the same thoughts on every topic at every moment

it's an impossibly punitive burden of expectation on another person

another perspective: relationships are fulfilling for 3 different reasons:
1. kindness - gentle with our imperfections and can tolerate us as we are
2. shared vulnerability - open about anxieties, worries, and problems that throw us off, that we can share in weakness
3. understanding - can make sense of our own mind, and who we can understand in turn
we end up feeling loved or satisfied in any other areas if those are in place
we'd still likely feel lonely and short on relations even if we knew all the same information together

From prison psych
Non-negotiables
1. Will we stay married?
2. We must stop labeling each other
  You are..., you do..., because of...
3. We need couples therapy
  We will need intervention if this can go anywhere

## how to cherish a wife

Love is about being gracious and altruistic.
Cherish is about being enthusiastic and enthralled.

Love tends to be quiet and understated.
Cherish boasts boldly and loudly.

Love thinks about others with selflessness.
Cherish thinks about its beloved with praise.

Love doesn’t want the worst for someone.
Cherish celebrates the best in someone.

Love puts up with a lot.
Cherish enjoys a lot.

The key to cherishing is to STOP COMPARING
- don't compare her actions to yours
- don't compare her to other women

It's not just a matter of loving her, but about enjoying her

Let our actions as well as our words show her/him that they are loved, respected and cared for.

MENTAL
Allow your wife to set your standard of beauty, and make it clear to her that she is secure. Your eyes are only for her. Security breeds confidence.

THE PAST
Acknowledge past hurts and forgive them

SHOWING SUPPORT
Surprise your partner by filling up their gas tank
Take care of the kids for a day so that she can have a personal spiritual retreat to recharge.
Help them
Be sensitive to their needs
Clean or organize something of yours she finds messy
Be an advocate for her rest. Gently help her to evaluate and set limits on her to-do list, reminding her that she loves others best when she takes time to replenish.
Be careful and considerate in our language.  Learn to give and receive feedback in a way that empowers your partner and your relationship. 
Acknowledge each other's feelings and the "stories" we tell ourselves without having to defend.
Accept your partner's limitations without comparing them to others and making them feel ashamed for where they may fall short.  You might need to do a "relationship reckoning" which means:  do the things my spouse provide me outweigh the things they don't?  If the answer is no - then you might need to walk away.  If the answer is yes - then you will likely need to grieve what you are missing and do so in a way that does not involve shaming our partner.  

CONFLICTS
When she messes up, respond with the kind of grace, compassion and mercy that God gives us.  Respond in a way that communicates, “You’re safe with me and I’m not going to rehash your failures. This is a secure place for you to grow and I love the journey with you.”

MAINTENANCE
Put effort into developing feelings of closeness
- ask what closeness looks like to her, then try to reproduce those conditions
Meet with your partner for a check-in at the end of the year
Ask important questions and talk about hard topics
Help your partner prioritize rest and self-care
Ask your partner how they feel most cherished
Gently protect her. Lovingly help her set boundaries with her time, energy, resources, and relationships (kids and mothers-in-law included).

PAMPERING/GENEROSITY
Plan out a spa day for her
Plan out a cute Valentine’s Day surprise
Bring your spouse a cup of coffee (or tea) in bed
Learn about your partner’s love language
When in doubt, work on spending quality time together
Make a playlist with songs that specifically encourage things you love about her.

SIGNALING
Remind yourself that you and your partner are on the same team
Let your partner know you’re putting in a conscious effort
Talk to your partner about meeting their emotional need
Remind your partner how much you value them on a daily basis
Leave your partner a love note where they’d least expect it
Send them a random text telling them you love them
Public display of affection
    Post on her Facebook wall: “I love being your husband. You still take my breath away.”
    Have your children write her notes or letters about what they love about her as a mom.
    Remind her of the amazing impact she has on other people and give specific examples.
Take updates
Compliment them
Do not try to change them
Cherish her by sending a text or email, “Praying for you today. Thanks for being so courageous in ________.”
Tell her areas she’s gifted in. Don’t stretch the truth: Be honest so she can trust you.

EXCLUSIVITY
Pay attention when the other is talking.  No distractions.  Eye contact is affirming and shows loving respect and consideration.  Let's have technology free time every day in order to make real time for real connection.  
Make them feel heard: listen to her sincerely

RECOLLECTING
Take out your photo album and reminisce about your wedding day
Remember how much the little things matter

OPENNESS
Talk through your budget together. Make sure you both have the resources you need to care for your family well. Esteem the wise financial decisions she makes.  This definitely shows you cherish her.
Make eye contact with them when they’re talking to you
Remember the power of physical touch in a relationship
Respect your differences
Talk about her fears – both deep and small. Overtime, lead her as you work together to replace those fears with faith in God as expressed in His Word.

PHYSICAL
Be a student of her body. Ask her, both while you’re in bed and at a completely separate private time, how you can please her sexually and make her feel secure and beautiful.
Give her a massage – one that doesn’t lead to sex, unless she’s clear that making love is what she would enjoy most.

DATING
Choose an activity and time for a date night
Be proactive about doing something together that she enjoys. Make a date, get her excited and share her enthusiasm!
Play together: Paintball, laser tag, sand volleyball. Have a picnic, go to the drive-in…
