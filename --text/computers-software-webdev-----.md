## general web dev learning path

1: Introduction to Front End Development and HTML
- How the Web works: HTTP, packets, browsers, developer tools, etc.
- takes ~1 week

2: CSS & SFX
- Special effects using CSS3/Fonts (soon to be deprecated)
- From now on you should try to explore every cool site you see, inspecting its CSS and element distribution with your favorite browser inspection tool.
- Some of them are done right, some of them aren't
the point is you need a "hacker attitude" in order to steal the interesting parts and become versed in the ways of deconstructing someone else's design in order to find out how it works.
- takes ~1 week

3: Your first project - a quiz
- Semantics, Standards & Validation for HTML/CSS
- takes ~1-2 weeks

4: Real world problems
- (Photoshop 101) (to be disc.)
- We will now learn how to transform a Photoshop document into an HTML layout. That means you will need to grasp a basic understanding of Photoshop tools for selecting, measuring and properties, which will then help you structure your HTML and define your CSS styles.
- Please note that in all these tutorials you'll find mistakes. And you'll notice them only if you've paid close attention to the standards, semantics, usability and accessibility notions presented so far. When you do, please correct them as you see fit, or ask me whether something is correct or not.
- takes ~3 weeks

5: final project
- example workflow standards
  - git and HTML standards
- SASS magic
  - CSS is powerful, but not dynamic. To make it dynamic, you need SASS.
- templating basics
 - Until now, we've looked at static HTML and CSS projects and how to develop a working site. Now we'll take that to the next level, by exploring how to transform a static structure into a real, dynamic website, with real information stored in a database and dynamic structures for iterating, searching and navigating the site. These are all example templating engines or languages.You should read through at least a couple of them to understand the basic principles.
