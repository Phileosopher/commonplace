[ACTIVITY: The Ideal Routine Blueprint - by Chris Guillebeau](https://www.yearofmentalhealth.com/p/activity-the-ideal-routine-blueprint)

habits are difficult to break in proportion to their complexity
- in practice, those habits are actually pretty easy to kill if we subdivide them
- however, they are NOT easy to break often because they are irreducibly complex (e.g., smoking, gambling)
- further, [marketing] firms and companies KNOW that addicts are great customers, so they try to create products that foster addiction
