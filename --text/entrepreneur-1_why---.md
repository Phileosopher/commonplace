## avoids rules

Kerkorian employed a core billionaires' technique of sidestepping petty
regulations.

Two rival American fruit companies wanted to acquire the same five
thousand acres of valuable land. Two different locals claimed to own the
deed. United Fruit dispatched a team of high-powered lawyers. They set
out in search of every file and scrap of paper in the country, ready to
pay whatever it cost to win. The tiny, uneducated competitor just met
separately with both of the supposed owners and bought the land from
each of them. He paid twice, sure, but it was over. The land was his.
Forget the rule book, settle the issue.

Everything weighs something, everything takes up space.
Nothing goes on a lunar module unless there's a really good reason.

## competitive

To perform like a champion, you also have to outflank thousands of
competitors who are perspiring every bit as profusely as you are. To
avoid being leveled out with the rest of them, you must do something
different. You have to contemplate bigger risks, try unorthodox business
strategies, or raise the ante in making deals. It is all right to copy
someone else's idea, but you have to execute it better. Ordinary efforts
and conventional approaches do not produce extraordinary wealth.

## controlling to a point

Buffett has not merely bought some shares of a company he likes, but
instead has acquired a controlling interest.

Buffett enhanced the value of his investments by becoming an active
member of the board of directors.

He began buying entire businesses near the beginning of his stint as a
money manager, long before his assets were great enough

He did not immerse himself in day-to-day operations. By and large,
Buffett relies on strong managers who share his passion for return on
investment.

Kerkorian lost his investment. He resolved not to invest thereafter in a
business he did not run.

If there was a charity doing something I thought was so important that I
should donate a substantial amount of my own money to it, I'd be doing
that work myself.

## creative

Being an entrepreneur means you're going to create something in a way
that a customer can't get anywhere else. Creation is art.

If, while driving down the street, we passed a vacant lot, he'd say, "That'd make a great spot for a hamburger place," or "I haven't seen a car wash for five miles. That's what this neighborhood needs: a car wash." He was always right.

(On being a band manager:) I got smart enough to ignore my taste in music. Instead I stuffed cotton in my ears, sat on the stage, and watched the audience. A band's success can be predicted by the audience's reaction.

## curious

"Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves." - Rainer Maria Rilke

## disciplined

Determined to realize his vast ambitions, Huizenga labored hard to
master his emotions and channel his immense energy productively.

The Forbes 400: the lucky few who have won the corporate lottery. Like most lotteries, this is a loser's game, with the odds against us.

We can't suddenly quit a job and then race to find a form of art that will pay off before the next mortgage payment is due. Creating art is a habit, one that we practice daily or hourly until we get good at it.

## experienced in success

An entrepreneur who'd failed in a previous venture was not likely to do
better than someone who'd never run a business in her life.

Successful entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are 50 percent more likely
to succeed in a second venture. The more you win, the more likely you
are to win again.

Looks like the advice of "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" and
"failure makes you wiser" isn't actually true.

## likes building wealth

Success is more likely to accrue to people who find intrinsic
satisfaction in the accumulation of wealth, as opposed to the possession
of wealth.

He was eager to move on, spurred less by the trappings of wealth than by
the challenge of increasing it.
"Wayne always keeps the carrot far enough out in front of him and he
never really wants to catch it," observes Dean Buntrock. "That's his
personality. He's never satisfied."

Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the
entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes
countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule
the world.

To succeed in business, you have to have a genuine interest in profitability. And most people don't.

## loves risky hard work

It's really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time, so if you don't love it, if you aren't having fun doing it, and you don't really love it, you're going to give up.

If you don't love it, you're going to fail.

Elon Musk said that starting a company is like "staring into the abyss and eating glass."

"Looking for my passion" is just an excuse in disguise. We use it to cover up for the fact that we're not progressing, growing, and taking action in life.

What about Bono, Branson, or Oprah? If you saw their schedules - the day in, day out demands they are under, and the pressure they shoulder - you wouldn't think what they do 95 percent of the time is that great at all. The rest of their days are spent in endless meetings, negotiations, contract reviews, lawsuits, makeup chairs, rehearsals, travel, and transportation.

I don't care what you do, it's going to suck most of the time. Tell yourself, "This work is going to suck 95 percent of the time."

I do not love what I do. But I sure as heck love why I do it. I am passionate about my mission of empowering entrepreneurs.

Bring passion to how you do even the most (seemingly) mundane tasks. I've seen mechanics, gardeners, toll takers, cab drivers, project managers, CPAs, lawyers, and CEOs execute the "hows" of their work with great passion and joy. Their passion was in the quality of the activity, the execution, and the outcome.

Refocus your mind and attention on who is being served by what you do, why and how you do it.

Being successful in business requires an emotional charge.

If that charge comes from your desire to right a wrong, fight the good fight, or seek justice, then it's just as good as love and often even better.

Products or companies that bear the owner's name convey very valuable messages. They are shouting that they have something to lose. Eponymy indicates both a commitment to the company and a confidence in the product.

## not perfectionist

In other professions, mistakes can be a disaster; surgeons, lawyers, and accountants are paid a premium for perfection. But mistakes are a daily part of life for serial entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurs fail for the rest of us.

Many entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game in the sense that their aim is to either cash out by selling the company they helped create to someone else, or "go public" by issuing shares in the stock market. The true value of the company, what it makes, and its long-term survival are of small relevance to them. This is a pure financing scheme and we will exclude this class of people from our "entrepreneur" risk-taker class (this form of entrepreneurship is the equivalent of bringing great-looking and marketable children into the world with the sole aim of selling them at age four). We can easily identify them by their ability to write a convincing business plan.

## old tPA what's an entrepreneur

### Entrepreneurs always sell when they're not creating

An owner constantly maintains customers
- Perpetually and tenaciously looks for new customers
- Uses every form of conventional and guerilla [marketing](http://philosaccounting.com/a/the-colors-of-the-mind/)
- Keeps customers with trustworthiness, character, and [happiness](http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-be-happy/)

Sells by focusing exclusively on customer needs and wants
- Ignore what the customer feels
- Ignore what potential customers think outside your marketing focus
- Focus on the image you sell the product or service as and not what it is
- [Focus on your target market](http://philosaccounting.com/a/the-colors-of-the-mind/) and consider adapting product lines for them
- You must understand and observe your market's economic movement and fluctuations

Fully clarify terms of any service agreement before customers sign it
- A customer could [sue you](http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-stay-out-of-court/) for any damages
- Without their awareness, a customer could negotiate you to work for free

## opportunistic - deal-making

Associates report being sent back to the negotiating table 15 times or
more until they emerge with terms that satisfy him.

"A deal," Huizenga once told an interviewer, with a smile, "it's like
chasing a girl. You work at it until she says yes."

Laurence Tisch's immense wealth derives mainly from buying low and
selling high.
Observers commonly overlook the negotiating skill that has enabled him
to obtain bargains that otherwise might have gone to his rivals.
A typical assessment runs along these lines:
To triumph as often as he has, Tisch has thumbed his nose at
conventional wisdom. He buys companies or stocks when they are wildly
unpopular and shuns anything that is remotely in vogue.
In many such comments over the years, the press has celebrated Tisch's
knack for finding value, while obscuring his effectiveness in adding value.

There are several different ways to realize value in buying and selling
businesses.
Negotiating favorable prices, both on the way in and on the way out, is
only the most obvious.
Another means of maximizing the gain on the round trip is to finance the
purchase on advantageous terms.
Further gains are achievable from increasing the asset's value,
following its purchase, through capable management.
Not to be ignored, either, is the compensation that can be extracted
during the ownership/management phase.
By exploiting all these profit sources in every transaction, and by
doing many transactions, it is possible to amass a sizable fortune.
Identifying the opportunities requires a keen sense of where the deals
are at a given time.
Clues can be found in the economic environment, the state of the capital
markets, and conditions in various industries.
Essential to astute deal making, as well, is a grasp of complex
transactions in which one side may wind up with a subtle, but ultimately
decisive, edge.

Tenacity, willingness to risk a huge loss, and creativity in forging
agreements are recurring themes.

Wayne Huizenga's creation of Waste Management:
In acquiring independent waste haulers, he minimized the haggling over
price by beginning at a level within 5 or 10 percent of the maximum that
he would pay.
Then, he would focus the discussion on such issues as the tax benefits
of taking Waste Management stock in payment and the seller's ongoing
relationship as an operator.

Wayne was famous for, "Do the deal now for $100, do it tomorrow for $90."

Huizenga sought to get deals completed quickly. His team would begin
negotiating on Monday morning and work 18 hours a day, seven days a
week, until the transaction closed.
He stuck rigorously to two rules:
Wayne Huizenga's Cardinal Rules for Closing Deals
1. Don't lose a deal by failing to pay attention to it
2. Never talk about a deal until it is signed

Deal making on the scale that produces billionaires requires nerves of
steel. At one time or another, the three superb negotiators profiled in
this chapter have all been in tight spots, facing potential bankruptcy.
If they did not enjoy the rush of adrenaline that accompanies a
successful deal, they could not have pursued the deal maker's route to
massive wealth accumulation. To replicate their success, you too will
have to learn to love the deals for their own sake.

The impetus behind Kirk Kerkorian's success has been his restlessness.
The wide variety of businesses he has engaged in supports his claim that
he started out with no specific ambition.
"I just tend to get dissatisfied easily and want to do something else,"
he once explained.
Day-to-day operations hold little appeal for him, but buying and selling
companies clearly does, even when incumbent management fights him tooth
and nail.

It was impossible to deal with Icahn. Every time he thought he had
reached an agreement, Icahn would come back to the negotiating table
with a new wrinkle or a revised number that altered the terms radically
in his favor. He delighted in extracting one wage concession after another.

Phil is very astute in analyzing what it is that is going to be the next
most important business or marketplace. He takes advantage of his assets
in ways most other people don't.

Like most successful deal makers, Anschutz showed a keen eye for value
from his earliest days. He was only 27 when he learned of a collection
of western art in the basement of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railway's Chicago headquarters. The railroad had originally commissioned
the paintings as models for travel posters. Managing to gain an
interview with the company's chairman, Anschutz offered to catalog the
largely forgotten works in exchange for the right to purchase a few. The
85 paintings that he bought for a song a few days later were eventually
valued at several million dollars.

"It's important to have your back to the wall," Phil Anschutz commented,
recollecting the oil-field fire. "It teaches you how to think outside
the box."

Sheer determination has been a consistent theme of the marathon runner's
long-run success in amassing wealth.

## opportunistic

Don't be too proud to take advantage of undeserved good fortune.

Like Sam Walton, Gates exemplifies the success achievable by those who
do not fall victim to the not-invented-here syndrome.

Operated within the services category, favoring rental businesses that
generate recurring revenues. "If I rent something," he explains,
"basically I'm selling the same thing over and over again."

He once remarked that auto sales and rentals represented a
trillion-dollar market and that he only wanted his fair share: half.

Meanwhile, in 1929, the stock market crashed. While others despaired,
Getty recognized the debacle as a golden opportunity to satisfy his
predilection for paying bottom dollar. Thanks to the plunge in oil
company shares, petroleum could be found more cheaply on Wall Street
than in the oil patch. "It was foolish," Getty reasoned, "to buy oil
properties with 100-cent dollars when you could buy them indirectly with
maybe 50-cent dollars.

He lays down his stipulations and then won't budge. He's a smart guy out
to make a buck. The amount he's already made doesn't matter.

Being self-sacrificing runs contrary to the principle of oneness. To
sacrifice myself to help others without receiving fair value in return
is to enter into an abusive relationship.
- I disagree with this: love can drive this
- however, it's CRITICAL with business contracts (i.e., no love) that there's a win/win

Half of succeeding in business is being in the right place at the right time; the other half is recognizing that time when it comes.
