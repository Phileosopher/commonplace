## MVP

(Dropbox:) To avoid the risk of waking up after years of development with a product nobody wanted, Drew did something unexpectedly easy: he made a video. The video is banal, a simple three-minute demonstration of the technology as it is meant to work.
- TECH WORK IS OFTEN VERY HEAVY ON R&D

Only at the point where the founders were too busy to bring on additional customers did Manuel and his team start to invest in automation

"We continued to run with humans replicating pieces of the backend for nine months. We hired eight people to manage queries, classify conversations, etc. We actually raised our seed and series A rounds before the system was automated. As we refined the product, we would bring in six to twelve people weekly to react to mockups, prototypes, or simulations that we were working on. It was a mix of existing users and people who never saw the product before. We had our engineers join for many of these sessions, both so that they could make modifications in real time, but also so we could all experience the pain of a user not knowing what to do."

## SaaS

[Nobody wants your fancy algorithm](https://joemorrison.substack.com/p/nobody-wants-your-fancy-algorithm)
- SaaS is a MAJOR non-thing for many people, but it sounds cool
- it feeds the business owner's ego, but isn't often a great business model because it collapses as soon as someone (open-sources) it.
- "market insights" is business jargon bullshit
- machine learning algos don't help: they're inherently (biased) by their creator, and are so niche that 99.999999% of the population won't ever WANT it
- further, if you make something generally useful, someone else can make a more specifically useful product on your generally useful platform, rendering you irrelevant, extra points if it was (FLOSS) because you lose ANY market edge

## taking risks

(About the techies who said they could do what he does:) The bet was that I could configure a web server before any of them could raise $1 million.
