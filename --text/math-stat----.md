## probability

An identical set of winning numbers came up twice in a single week.
It was improbable that the names of medieval rabbis are hidden in the letters of the Torah. But is it?
Improbability is a relative notion, not an absolute one.
When we say an outcome is improbable, we are always saying, explicitly or not, that it is improbable under some set of hypotheses we've made about the underlying mechanisms of the world.

To calculate probabilities:
If two events are independent in the sense that the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of the other, then the probability that they both occur is computed by multiplying the probabilities of the individual events.

The probability of obtaining two heads in two flips of a coin is ½ × ½ = ¼ since the probability of five straight coin flips resulting in heads is (½)⁵ = 1⁄32.

The probability that an event doesn't occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that it does (a 20 percent chance of rain implies an 80 percent chance of no rain).

(5⁄6)⁴ is the probability of not rolling a 6 in four rolls of the die.
Hence, subtracting this number from 1 gives us the probability that this latter event (no 6s) doesn't occur or, in other words, of there being at least one 6 rolled in the four tries: 1 - (5⁄6)⁴ = .52.
Likewise, the probability of rolling at least one 12 in twenty-four rolls of a pair of dice is seen to be 1 - (35⁄36)²⁴ = .49.

Binomial probability distribution arises whenever a procedure or trial may result in "success" or "failure" and one is interested in the probability of obtaining R successes in N trials.

Half of the time that twenty-three randomly selected people are gathered together, two or more of them will share a birthday.
By dividing this latter product (365 × 364 × 363 × 362 × 361) by 3655, we get the probability that five people chosen at random will have no birthday in common.
Now, if we subtract this probability from 1, we get the complementary probability that at least two of the five people do have a birthday in common.
A similar calculation using 23 rather than 5 yields ½, or 50 percent, as the probability that at least two of twenty-three people will have a common birthday.

It would be very unlikely for unlikely events not to occur.
If you don't specify a predicted event precisely, there are an indeterminate number of ways for an event of that general kind to take place.

The expected value of a quantity is simply the average of its values weighted according to their probabilities.
For example: If ...
* 1/4 of the time a quantity equals 2
* 1/3 of the time it equals 6
* 1/3 of the time it equals 15
* remaining 1⁄12 of the time it equals 54
... then its expected value equals 12.
This is so since [12 = (2 × 1/4) + (6 × 1⁄3) + (15 × 1⁄3) + (54 × 1⁄12)].

Consider a home-insurance company: On average, each year...
* one out of every 10,000 of its policies will result in a claim of $200,000
* one out of 1,000 policies will result in a claim of $50,000
* one out of 50 will result in a claim of $2,000
* the remainder will result in a claim of $0.
The insurance company would like to know what its average payout is per policy written.
The answer is the expected value, which in this case is
($200,000 × 1/10,000) +
($50,000 × 1/1,000) +
($2,000 × 1/50) +
($0 × 9,789/10,000) =
$20 + $50 + $40 = $110.

Chuck-a-luck:
You pick a number from 1 to 6 and the operator rolls three dice.
If the number you pick comes up on all three dice, the operator pays you $3
if it comes up on two of the three dice, he pays you $2
if it comes up on just one of the three dice, he pays you $1.
Only if the number you picked doesn't come up at all do you pay him anything - just $1.
Say you pick the number 4.
Chances that a 4 will come up on all three dice?
= 1⁄6 × 1⁄6 × 1⁄6 = 1⁄216; so, approximately 1/216th
Chances of a 4 coming up only twice?
= Use the binomial probability distribution: X44, 4X4, or 44X, the X indicating a non-4.
The probability of the first is 5⁄6 × 1⁄6 × 1⁄6 = 5⁄216,
the probability of a 4 coming up on two of the three dice is 15⁄216,
probability of obtaining exactly one 4 among 4XX is 1⁄6 × 5⁄6 × 5⁄6 = 25⁄216,
Adding, we get 75⁄216.
Chances that no 4s come up when we roll three dice?
= find how much probability is left over.
Subtract (1⁄216 + 15⁄216 + 75⁄216) from 1
The expected value of your winnings is thus:
($3 × 1⁄216) + ($2 × 15⁄216) + ($1 × 75⁄216) + (-$1 × 125⁄216)
= $(-17⁄216) = - $.08
And so, on average, you would lose approximately eight cents every time you played this seemingly attractive game.

Gambler's fallacy is the mistaken belief that because a coin has come up heads several times in a row, it's more likely to come up tails on its next flip.

Peter and Paul, who flip a coin at the rate of once a day and who bet on heads and tails respectively. Whoever is ahead will probably have been ahead almost the whole time. If Peter is ahead at the end, it's considerably more likely that he's been ahead more than 96 percent of the time than that he's been ahead between 48 percent and 52 percent of the time.

It can take a long, long time for the lead to switch.

The number of accidents each year at a certain intersection, the number of rainstorms per year in a given desert, the number of cases of leukemia in a specified county, have all been described quite accurately by the so-called Poisson probability distribution. It's necessary first to know roughly how rare the event is. But if you do know, you can use this information along with the Poisson formula to get a quite accurate idea of the percentage of years in which there would be no desert rainstorms, one such storm, two storms, three, and so on. In this sense, even very rare events are quite predictable.

Assume the probability to be one out of 10,000 that a particular dream matches in a few vivid details some sequence of events in real life.

Since (9,999/10,000)365 is about .964, we can conclude that about 96.4 percent of the people who dream every night will have only nonmatching dreams during a one-year span. But that means that about 3.6 percent of the people who dream every night will have a predictive dream.

Incredible coincidences, whose probability, let's say, is estimated to be one in a trillion (1 divided by 1012, or 10−12). Should we be impressed? Not necessarily. Since by the multiplication principle there are (2.5 × 108 × 2.5 × 108)/2 or 3.13 × 1016 different pairs of people in the United States, and since we're assuming the probability of this collection of coincidences to be about 10−12, the average number of "incredible" linkages we can expect is 3.13 × 1016 times 10−12, or about 30,000.

Astrology:
The gravitational pull of the delivering obstetrician far outweighs that of the planet or planets involved.
Does this mean that fat obstetricians deliver babies that have one set of personality characteristics, and skinny ones deliver babies that have quite different characteristics?
There is no correlation between the date of one's birth and scores on any standard personality test.
Birth dates of more than 16,000 scientists and 6,000 politicians found the distribution of their signs was random, the signs uniformly distributed throughout the year.
The records of 3,000 married couples found no correlation between their signs and astrologers' predictions about compatible pairs of signs.

Many mundane mistakes in reasoning can be traced to a shaky grasp of the notion of conditional probability.
Unless the events A and B are independent, the probability of A is different from the probability of A given that B has occurred.

The probability of rolling a pair of dice and getting a 12 is 1⁄36.
The conditional probability of getting a 12 when you know you have gotten at least an 11 is 1⁄3.
A confusion between the probability of A given B and the probability of B given A is also quite common.

Imagine a man with three cards.
One is black on both sides, one red on both sides, and one black on one side and red on the other.
He drops the cards into a hat and asks you to pick one, but only to look at one side; let's assume it's red.
The man notes that the card you picked couldn't possibly be the card that was black on both sides, and therefore it must be one of the other two cards - the red-red card or the red-black card.
He offers to bet you even money that it is the red-red card.
Is this a fair bet?
At first glance, it seems so. There are two cards it could be; he's betting on one, and you're betting on the other.
But the rub is that there are two ways he can win and only one way you can win.
His chances of winning are thus 2⁄3.
The conditional probability of the card being red-red given that it's not black-black is ½, but that's not the situation here.
We know more than just that the card is not black-black; we also know a red side is showing.

Confusing a conditional statement - if A, then B - with its converse - if B, then A - is a very common mistake.
A slightly unusual version of it occurs when people reason that if X cures Y, then lack of X must cause Y.
If the drug dopamine, e.g., brings about a decrease in the tremors of Parkinson's disease, then lack of dopamine must cause tremors.
If some other drug relieves the symptoms of schizophrenia, then an excess of it must cause schizophrenia.
One is not as likely to make this mistake when the situation is more familiar. Not too many people believe that since aspirin cures headaches, lack of aspirin in the bloodstream must cause them.

Imagine four dice, A, B, C, and D, strangely numbered as follows:
* A has 4 on four faces and 0 on two faces
* B has 3s on all six faces
* C has four faces with 2 and two faces with 6
* D has 5 on three faces and 1 on three faces.
If die A is rolled against die B, die A will win - by showing a higher number - two-thirds of the time.
If die B is rolled against die C, B will win two-thirds of the time.
If die C is rolled against die D, it will win two-thirds of the time.
Nevertheless, and here's the punch line, if die D is rolled against die A, it will win two-thirds of the time.
A beats B beats C beats D beats A, all two-thirds of the time.
That die C beats die D may require some explanation:
Half of the time, a 1 will turn up on die D, in which case die C will certainly win.
The other half of the time, a 5 will turn up on die D, in which case die C will win one-third of the time.
Thus, since C can win in these two different ways, it beats D exactly ½ + (½ × 1⁄3) = 2⁄3 of the time.

A dress whose price has been "slashed" 40 percent and then another 40 percent has been reduced in price by 64 percent, not 80.

Always ask yourself: "Percentage of what?"
If profits are 12 percent, for example, is this 12 percent of costs, of sales, of last year's profits, or of what?
When I hear that something or other is selling at a fraction of its normal cost, I comment that the fraction is probably 4⁄3.

The "broad base" fallacy: quoting the absolute number rather than the probability.
"Holiday Carnage Kills 500 Over Four-Day Weekend" (this is about the number killed in any four-day period).

Someone offers you a choice of two envelopes and tells you one has twice as much money in it as the other.
You pick envelope A, open it, and find $100.
Envelope B must, thus, have either $200 or $50.
When the proposer permits you to change your mind, you figure you have $100 to gain and only $50 to lose by switching your choice, so you take envelope B instead.
The question is: Why didn't you choose B in the first place?
It's clear that no matter what amount of money was in the envelope originally chosen, given permission to change your mind, you would always do so and take the other envelope.
Without any knowledge of the probability of there being various amounts of money in the envelopes, there is no way out of this impasse.
Variations of it account for some of the "grass is always greener" mentality.

A tenfold gap in sexual activity - with one person having sex once a month, and another having sex ten times a month - is far more common than a tenfold gap in income.

Derren Brown once produced an undoctored film of him tossing a coin into a bowl and getting heads ten times in a row.
Brown later explained the trick: the stunning sequence came only at the end of nine excruciating hours of filming, when the string of ten heads finally materialized.

Extraordinary events can happen without extraordinary causes.

Random events often look like nonrandom events.

The probability that two events will both occur can never be greater than the probability that each will occur individually.

Cicero wrote that "probability is the very guide of life."

These three laws, simple as they are, form much of the basis of probability theory:
- If two possible events, A and B, are independent, then the probability that both A and B will occur is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.
- If an event can have a number of different and distinct possible outcomes, A, B, C, and so on, then the probability that either A or B will occur is equal to the sum of the individual probabilities of A and B, and the sum of the probabilities of all the possible outcomes (A, B, C, and so on) is 1 (that is, 100 percent).
- When you want to know the chances that two independent events, A and B, will both occur, you multiply; if you want to know the chances that either of two mutually exclusive events, A or B, will occur, you add.
