But if you care about privacy at all (and you should), encryption should be the default. If all you use Signal for is "sensitive communications", and everything else is plaintext, that's pretty much a big HEY HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TO HIDE sign to any potential attacker.
Also, cryptography isn't foolproof, and there's always the occasional backdoor introduced on purpose because some intelligence agency thought nobody should be able to snoop but them! And then said backdoors end up being used by other actors who aren't "the good guys", and also it turns the good guys maybe weren't good in the first place.
