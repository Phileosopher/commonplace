(2018) Elon Musk reveals his productivity rules in a letter he sent to Tesla employees
> - Get of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.
> - Also get rid of frequent meetings
> - Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value.
> - Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects
> - Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done
> - A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is allow free flow of information between all levels
> - If following a “company rule” is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation, such that it would make for a great Dilbert cartoon, then the rule should change.
