NOTE: will need to build/add to it after finishing entrepreneurship pages

Christian church planting can do all the WORK of an entrepreneurship
- however, the REASON for the work should be different, meaning the measurement of results should differ dramatically
- the scope should be in how much (meaning) was created toward spiritual (i.e., eternal) ends, NOT in any particular quantity
- to that end, the quality of the stories should be the defining factor of success in a ministry
- NOTE: THIS ALSO APPLIES TO CHURCH LEADERSHIP IN GENERAL, AND MAY FIT THERE INSTEAD
