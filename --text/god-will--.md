Whether we are in God's will and doing what He wants is not outcome-dependent

We assume our will is unchangeable by God, but He can bend it to accomplish Hisnpurposes (heart of king is in His hand)
If we knew what God knows and wanted what God wants, we'd agree He's making the best decision

God is not going to reveal information for His will if He knows we won't use it
- we are to do His will, step by step, and He will reveal it as we need it

God brings us always through 3 phases:
1 deliverance
2 development
3 destiny
this means we will need to wait for Him to act, and often longer than we'd prefer
