However, men and women *can* work very well with each other:

- It's often [taboo](morality-taboo.mds/) to say, but the two genders work best with women detecting problems and strategizing while men make difficult decisions and fix problems.
- Women often want men's roles, but are too intelligent to have the confidence to maintain those roles.
- When men are placed in a supporting role to women, they don't have the mental ability to reason out possible risks or problems.

What men must learn:

- Compared to women, men are unsophisticated and emotionally uninvolved.
- Women crave close, personal affection and security.
  - Affirm her frequently, such as calling her beautiful.
  - Acknowledge her feelings without *any* context (e.g., "that feels sad").
  - Show physical, non-sexual affection.
  - Perform small acts of kindness for her (e.g., opening the door for her).
  - Give at least two months' notice for any large decision, including [marriage proposals](relationships-weddings.md) and [children](parenting-babies.md).
  - Always stay open to expanding your [awareness](awareness.md) of feelings and sentiments.
- Usually, a woman will vent her frustrations, but do *not* try to fix it: just [listen](language-speaking.md).
- Learn additional [self-maintenance](people-2_image.md) to meet a woman's standard.
- Men are typically unaware of many situational risks, so listen to women.

What women must learn:

- Compared to men, women are complicated and inefficient.
- Men crave respect for accomplishments and challenging experiences.
  - Admire what he's done, especially regarding his [career](jobs-1_why.md) and [parenting](parenting-children.md).
  - [Tactfully](people-3_respect.md) tell him what you *really* think and believe, because he won't understand an implication.
- Women usually experience feelings *far* more intensely than men.
  - Scale your feelings down [into words he can understand](language-speaking.md).
  - Give them more personal space to let them cope with the emotional intensity.
- Most women overestimate the intelligence of men.
  - Men don't understand implications as well and aren't trying to be rude or impatient.
- Women tend to overcommunicate smaller risks because they think they weren't heard, but they must learn to trust that men will tackle everything eventually.

women are wired to take care of babies, and that makes them extremely kind and patient with the failings of the object in question
- this is vital to life, otherwise babies would be neglected and die
- the issue is that it's the wrong time and place in many other contexts, and stops being [effective](purpose) after 6 months
- when they haven't been programmed out of it, they will continue with that infant-based mindset and treat EVERYTHING of value like a 6-month-old
- the [political](power-types) result of this (i.e., women in power) is to create an anti-predator mindset, which effectively gives ZERO [justice] to that claimed "predator" (e.g., [political violence](war) within [leftism])

marriage devolves in stages:
1. First, they will coexist well-enough, with routine encounters with each other that involve the elements of surprise and fascination. The two will be in a state of "play", both of them in a dynamic that explores each other.
2. After the flames of passion die off, the two of them will transition into a dull routine. That routine, specifically in its lack of both people changing as they experience each other, is the first warning sign, and the presence of other people in the community in their lives can kickstart that routine again by providing new ways to see each other. It may have happened if my father lived with us eight months ago.
3. For any variety of reasons, the female will fail to create a meaningful connection with the male, and in an attempt to maintain it will trade out her "feminine" qualities (i.e., connection, nurture, holistic thinking, sentiment) for "masculine" ones (i.e., strength, assertion, directness). Since women are not disposed to those qualities, it will implement as something else entirely. This may involve criticizing, condemning, or complaining.
  - In the process, she may devote her heart to another male figure who demonstrates those qualities. More often than not, the new male figure is less familiar to her, meaning they're starting into Step 1 together, and she doesn't realize this will repeat itself eventually.
4. The natural male response will be to treat their not-male-but-behaving-like-a-male female as a male. If he does, the dominance hierarchy will come into force, and it will yield increasingly worse results. This is what happened in my marriage.
5. However, if that male does not respond to the dominance signal with more dominance, the female will have to eventually perform some form of self-reflection on her actions. She will have to decide on revisiting her femininity for the sake of the relationship (which is an inherent risk) or keep doing what she's doing and risk destroying the relationship further. It gets harder for her to change the longer she persists in that state.
In effect, most marriages are in various states of decline. A marriage-ending altercation is always brewing, waiting for someone to snap, and the only cure is through the steady and consistent regeneration of both people to become better versions of themselves. My opinion is that it's through Christ alone to find those tools, but that's more a discussion of how than of what.

MUCH OF OUR GENDER IDENTITY IS IN THE FORMATIVE UTILITY AS WE EXPLORE OUR INFANT BODY AS A SOUL
- MEN ARE RUDIMENTARY, AND ONLY ALIGN TO [PURPOSE]
- WOMEN HAVE A REPRODUCTION MECHANISM THAT CREATES A [SAFETY] MODEL, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WIRED AROUND 2 THINGS AT ONCE

- the genders are irreconcilably different on the biological level, which means they are NOT equally good for the same things
  - it may be true for statistical outliers, but there are still fully-encompassing probabilities that can't be ignored
