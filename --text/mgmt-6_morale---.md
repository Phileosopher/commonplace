## workplace culture

In an ideal business environment, everybody should have a rough idea of what everyone else is going through. People should be free to talk. Banter is essential.

Put people together in a way that will have them bouncing ideas off each other, befriending each other, and taking care of each other.

We try as far as we can to make people feel as if they are working for their own company. Our more senior people have share stakes or options in the companies they run.

Someone described Virgin as an 'unprofessional professional organisation', which for my money is just about the best backhanded compliment anyone in business could ever receive. We run our companies professionally and we make sure that everyone does their job to the highest standards. But the way we make sure is to see that people are having fun. Fun is not about acting stupid. It's the feeling you get when you're on top of things. We try to make sure that the people who come into contact with a Virgin business end up with a smile on their face (not always easy).

It's about turning what excites you in life into capital, so that you can do more of it and move forward with it. I think entrepreneurship is our natural state - a big adult word that probably boils down to something much more obvious like 'playfulness'.

Inspire your people to think like entrepreneurs, and whatever you do, treat them like adults. The hardest taskmaster of all is a person's own conscience, so the more responsibility you give people, the better they will work for you.

The more you free your people to think for themselves, the more they can help you. You don't have to do this all on your own.

We didn't need cross-holdings, or strong family structures: we had a flag. The bonding power of the Virgin brand has permitted us to take the bold decision to give everyone the opportunity to be entrepreneurs in their own right. It is a flag to which all members of our extended family pay due respect. They enjoy the advantages of doing business under the Virgin umbrella, and in return they agree to protect the integrity of the brand. If they don't, then we can legally withdraw the name. Everybody fights for their own particular Virgin company - and shares in the upside when things go well.

I now have a team of people who meet once a week to go through every Virgin company, looking at figures, projections and income. They have a list of priorities, and a list of new projects. They make sure that the Virgin Group is running efficiently. This frees me up to dive in and out when necessary.

Jack Welch encouraged managers to start each day as if it was the first day in the job. He said that managers were often afraid of change - and they must embrace it.

Success turns not on being the low-price leader but on being the high-trust leader.

What matters now:
Trust
Permission
Remarkability
Leadership
Stories that spread
Humanity: connection, compassion, and humility
And here's the thing: All six of these are the result of successful work by artists.

Leadership puts the leader on the line.

If you ask someone for the rule book on how to lead, you're secretly wishing to be a manager. Leaders are vulnerable, not controlling, and they are taking us to a new place.

We seek out human originality and caring.

What we are drawn to is the vulnerability and transparency that bring us together.

Our revolution is turning most business into show business.

when they move from task to show, they are adding far more value than ever before.

Connection requires emotional labor: a little more emotional labor is often worth a lot.

The race to the bottom is lower prices, find cheaper labor.
The other race is the race to the top, the opportunity to be the one they can't live without.

Delivering more for more.

It's not what you've got; it's how brave you're prepared to be.

(2021) Be a better coworker
> Organization. Don't lose crap, ever. Passwords, dates, files, emails, notes, links, whatever.
> Responsiveness. Be easy to reach and quick to respond (but protect your focused deep work time).
> Reliability. If you said you'll do it, then freaking do it, no matter how tiny it is. People notice.
> Warmth. Maybe you can't be funny or charming, but you can be warm.

## workplace culture - building camaraderie

Something that must be written into every business plan: This company will have lots and lots of parties and social get-togethers. Parties are a way of galvanising teams and allowing people to let their hair down. They have to be inclusive and encouraging, and then they are an excellent way of bringing everyone together and forging a great business culture.

## workplace culture - curating habits

Notice how many times people have tweaked the environment to shape your
behavior.
Example: Robby and Kent who frequently arrive late and then sit in the
back of the room:
Shape the Path.
1. Tweak the environment. Lock the door when the bell rings so
    latecomers are stuck in the hallway.
2. Build habits. Start having a daily quiz with one or two quick
    questions at the beginning of every class. If Robby and Kent aren't
    present to take the quiz, they'll fail.
3. Rally the herd. Post a class "on-time" record on the wall. Maybe when
    Robby and Kent see that they're the only students violating the social
    norm to be on time, they'll change their ways.
4. Build habits. Set a policy that the last student in his or her seat
    every day will be asked to answer the first question.
5. Rally the herd. Find a way to let Robby and Kent know that the other
    students dislike what they're doing (as they almost certainly do). Often
    troublemakers have the illusion that their defiant behavior makes them
    folk heroes. They can be deflated quickly by frank peer feedback.
6. Tweak the environment. Do what Bart Millar actually did: He bought a
    used couch and put it right at the front of the classroom. It was
    immediately obvious that this couch was the cool place to sit - students
    could slouch and relax instead of sitting at a dorky desk. Suddenly
    Robby and Kent started getting to class early every day so they could
    "get a good seat." They were volunteering to sit at the front of the
    classroom. Genius.
Leaders had to reshape the Path consciously. With some simple tweaks to
the environment, suddenly the right behaviors emerged. It wasn't the
people who changed; it was the situation. What looks like a people
problem is often a situation problem.

Design an environment in which undesired behaviors are made not only
harder but impossible.

HADDON MATRIX: In trying to minimize the risk of bad outcomes, injury-prevention
experts often turn to the Haddon Matrix, a simple framework that
provides a way to think systematically about accidents by highlighting
three key periods of time: pre-event, event, and post-event.

Rackspace example: When the call-queuing system was thrown out, the
customer-service staffers quickly developed the habit of answering the
phone.

Action triggers can have a profound power to motivate people to do the
things they know they need to do. Peter Gollwitzer argues that the value
of action triggers resides in the fact that we are preloading a
decision. Dropping off Anna at school triggers the next action, going to
the gym. There's no cycle of conscious deliberation. By preloading the
decision, we conserve the Rider's self-control.

When people predecide, they "pass the control of their behavior on to
the environment." Gollwitzer says that action triggers "protect goals
from tempting distractions, bad habits, or competing goals."

Habits are behavioral autopilot, and that's why they're such a critical
tool for leaders. Leaders who can instill habits that reinforce their
teams' goals are essentially making progress for free. They've changed
behavior in a way that doesn't draw down the Rider's reserves of
self-control.

Habits will form inevitably, whether they're formed intentionally or
not. You've probably created lots of team habits unwittingly. If your
staff meetings always start out with genial small talk, then you've
created a habit. You've designed your meeting autopilot to yield a few
minutes of warm-up small talk. The hard question for a leader is not how
to form habits but which habits to encourage.

A good change leader never thinks, "Why are these people acting so
badly? They must be bad people."
A change leader thinks, "How can I set up a situation that brings out
the good in these people?"

A self-disciplined employee will have the patience to conduct routine business routinely, the talent to respond exceptionally to exceptional circumstances, and the wisdom to know the difference.

Delivery is never rocket science. When we move from sector to sector, I'd say about 90 per cent of our core delivery strategy comes with us and slots straight in, without adjustment, without fuss, without trouble. Getting to grips with an unfamiliar infrastructure is simply a question of workload - of mastering detail.

The team had a real sense of autonomy. I didn't need to be involved day-to-day, but I was sent regular information and figures, which I looked at each night. From the off, the business acted like a listed company - and that's how all start-ups should try to behave.

Engage your emotions at work. Your instincts and emotions are there to help you. They are there to make things easier. For me, business is a 'gut feeling', and if it ever ceased to be so, I think I would give it up tomorrow. By 'gut feeling', I mean that I believe I've developed a natural aptitude, tempered by huge amounts of experience, that tends to point me in the right direction.

## workplace culture - responsibility culture

GROUP:
"That's not my problem" is possibly the worst thing people can think.
Silent disengagement, the consequence of specialized technicians
sticking narrowly to their domains.
We need them to see their job not just as performing their isolated set
of tasks well but also as helping the group get the best possible results.
People who don't know one another's names don't work together nearly as
well as those who do.

When you're always online you're always distracted. So the always online
organization is the always unproductive organization.

Asymmetric paternalism. That's a fancy name for a simple idea: creating
policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational
impulses and make better, more prudent decisions.

What happens on weekends and nights directly affects a person's
perfomance during the workday. The person with a constructive office-job
life nearly always is more successful than the person who lives in a
dull dreary home situation.

As the leader, you ultimately have 100 percent responsibility for everything. When a widget rolls off the line with a broken thingamajig, it's not the fault of the guy who was texting instead of quality-controlling. It's your fault. When a customer is mistreated at a store halfway across the country, don't blame the customer service agent with a bad attitude. You're to blame.

Everyone hates bosses. Don't be a boss. And managers are wienies. Don't be a manager. Become a Twenty-First Century Leader. As the leader, you set the pace. You create the standards.

This string is like an army. Push it from behind, and it doubles up on itself - you get nowhere. To drive it forward you have to pull it from the front, and it will follow you in perfect order."

Leadership lesson in preschool, where we learned to walk in a straight line. She walked in front, leading the way, and at every turn she called to us: "Follow me!"

Leadership in the twenty-first century is less about the words that come out of you and more about what exists within you.
