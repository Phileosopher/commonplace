#### delegation

Don't promote high-agreeableness ppl to positions of leadership
- 80% of CEOs are psychopaths, What % are pastors?
- This was true in the Catholic priesthood
- it's a power vacuum because of Jesus' physical absence

Christians have no faith in the Law of Large Numbers, though the Holy Spirit is most certainly capable to work
- answers are there, often in the Least of These

#### discipleship

ADD LEADERSHIP PAGE TO THEOLOGOS SITE "CHURCH" UNDER "ALL CHURCHES ARE FLAWED" WHEN DONE
ADD LEADERSHIP PAGE TO THEOLOGOS SITE "DISCIPLESHIP" AT THE TOP WHEN DONE
- Spiritual mentors are leaders, even by secular standards.

Legitimate Christians show specific characteristics, and THEY should be the ones running the Church:
1. They confess Jesus is God's Son ([Romans 10:9](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/rom.10.9), [1 Corinthians 12:3](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1co.12.3)).
2. Their lifestyle consistently [changes](https://gainedin.site/changes/) as they discover new truths.
3. They [love others](https://gainedin.site/love/) through the Holy Spirit working on them.
    - While love isn't always intimacy, it's an authentic concern for others' well-being.
4. They're developing a solid spiritual [doctrine](https://gainedin.site/philosophy/), even when they believe some false teachings.

The "leadership" of the Church is the people: the unwashed new believers and inexperienced members
- the ministers are supposed to serve them, which requires a certain selflessness that can't be reproduced otherwise
- to falsely reproduce it is to have a silly, self-flagellating humble-down: "I am the worst", "No, IIII am the greatest of all sinners"

#### evangelism

Church [leaders](https://theologos.site/leadership/) can often fail when they mandate an evangelism system.
- It's good to have a system for the people who don't know how to do something, but making it MANDATORY will suppress what the Holy Spirit can do with an individual person's unique experiences.

#### funding

From a financial standpoint, running a church should NOT be hard:
- At 10% of everyone's income, a fulltime pastor would only need donations from 10 people who gave 10% of THEIR income (15 people if we're talking post-tax donations)
- administrative overhead is another requirement, but it's generally proportional to the relative size needs of the congregation
- if they're not giving enough, provide more transparency about the where the money goes, _especially_ to the fringe non-core Body

#### growth through hardship

Besides in-fighting, the Church is also fighting [a](https://theologos.site/spiritual-warfare/) _[constant](https://theologos.site/demon-tricks/)_ [struggle with Satan](https://theologos.site/spiritual-warfare/).
- Many Christians obsess with unifying the churches, but unity only matters [in Christ](https://theologos.site/identity/) and doesn't correspond to [our wide range of personalities](https://gainedin.site/personality/).

ALL Christianity is anti-fragile
- persecution and hardship create positive feedback loops for Christians
- this means that the simpler you make the message and leadership structure, the more durable the organization

#### maintaining simple messaging

The Christian message SHOULD be simple:
- Live with eternity and "now" in mind
- Devote your effort fully to His cause, then dovetail all things into it
- Hand off responsibility as much as others wish to shoulder the burden and have the spiritual authority to do so
- (however, this isn't practiced because most Christian leadership aren't entirely aware of what they're leading or how)

When you hold events, make sure to NOT constantly advertise other events
- modern [American Christianity] is built around [constantly getting people to the venue](https://icould.fail/marketing)
- however, it doesn't respect that each person's life is a dynamic and involved experience
- if you want to run a church correctly, consistently cross-promote things that are NOT in your influence (e.g., community center events from other nonprofits, other churches' activities from other denominations)
    - and, to go further, get involved and work alongside OTHER groups that started certain things (e.g., don't start a homeless clothing drive if another church 2 miles away already has been doing one)

#### scaling

THEOLOGOS CHURCH ADMIN
- Churches scale like any other organization, with a once-a-month two-minute task for a pastor slowly adapting to a full-time job for one person.
- The Launch Big model is a high-cost growth strategy that reflects secular non-profit organizations.

One of the reasons the Christian Church suffers is that it uses all the tactics from NPOs (check GIS Influence under "Abuse" regarding giving resources, and paraphrase)

Large-scale laws were designed for large-scale society
- the Bible is absolutely silent on how to run large-scale society, likely because [His kingdom] hasn't come yet

#### support network

In an underground Church, a [spiritual leader's](https://icould.fail/leadership/) wife, not _just_ the leader, must devote herself wholly to the cause of Christ as well.
- She _must_ push him to the ministry he's called to, and if she loves the world too much (e.g., wants creature comforts, nice food, hobbies) she _will_ discourage him.

#### venues

Conventionally, venues can be volunteered by Christians or acquired much more affordably. Campuses like churches, colleges, movie theaters, parks, and clubs are all acceptable.

Further, the internet's ubiquity can magnify remote centers. Get hosts to volunteer their home and connect via conference call, telecast from a larger venue onto satellite venues, have group meetings where each location shares one screen for dialogue and feedback.

There are many other options nobody has thought of or, at least, talked about. The collective creativity is all in the brains of the people who run things, but they have to see a motivation to consider doing it over the conventional way.
