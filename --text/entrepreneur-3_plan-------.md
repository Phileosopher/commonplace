## considering all stakeholders

The offering MUST add value to EVERY stakeholder: customers, vendors/collaborators, the company's employees
- Otherwise, you can't [market] it reliably

The founding moment of a company: set the rules that will align people toward the creation of value in the future.

"Company culture" doesn't exist apart from the company itself.

A startup is a team of people on a mission.

Recruiting is a core competency for any company. It should never be outsourced.
- BOUNCES OVER TO [MGMT TEAMS]

The seven questions that every business must answer:
1. The Engineering Question Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
2. The Timing Question Is now the right time to start your particular business?
3. The Monopoly Question Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. The People Question Do you have the right team?
5. The Distribution Question Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
6. The Durability Question Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
7. The Secret Question Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
Any great business plan must address every one of them.
If you don't have good answers to these questions, you'll run into lots of "bad luck".

Every good business design has at least one strategic control point. The best business designs have two or more.
Intel, for example, has a 2-year lead, value chain control, and a brand.
Coca-Cola has a brand, a low-cost logistics system, value chain management, and a string of superdominant positions.

## considering competitors

Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival.

The more we compete, the less we gain.

The hazards of imitative competition may partially explain why individuals with an Asperger's-like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in Silicon Valley today. If you're less sensitive to social cues, you're less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you.

Don't disrupt: avoid competition.

You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you further.

I have often given entrepreneurs fearful of this issue the following assignment: take one of your ideas (one of your lesser insights, perhaps), find the name of the relevant product manager at an established company who has responsibility for that area, and try to get that company to steal your idea. Call them up, write them a memo, send them a press release - go ahead, try it. The truth is that most managers in most companies are already overwhelmed with good ideas. Their challenge lies in prioritization and execution.

If a competitor can outexecute a startup once the idea is known, the startup is doomed anyway. You believe you can accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. If that's true, it makes no difference what the competition knows. If it's not true, a startup has much bigger problems, and secrecy won't fix them. Sooner or later, a successful startup will face competition from fast followers.

The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.

## considering customers

Choose a few consumers that you really feel are the early adopters, test
it with them, see what they like about it and what they don't like about
it … And, if it appeals to them, use them to optimize it [the idea]
further and then the laggards will follow.

always consider the customers' desires
- Customers pay the entire organization
- Consistency is often more valuable than quality
- Customers care about fast and reliable results more than distributors, vendors, sellers or anyone else
- Customers choose an expert because they appear to be more valuable than the competition

## defining the market

Entrepreneurs understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.

Expand your repertoire of strategic and tactical moves.

## executive summary

Mantra: 3 or 4 words that explain why your company should exist.

The executive summary is the most important part. It must be fantastic, eyeball sucking, and pulse altering. Explain why your product is curve jumping, paradigm shifting, and revolutionary.

## financing

If you do get investors, bear in mind that THEY'RE taking a risk on you
- This means that since you believe in your product more than them, their risk tolerance will be lower and worth considering in your business decisions

Securing financing is NOT a "must", but it is a tremendous timesaver
- if it's small enough, 1 person can do it without financing

## finding profit

The number one problem in business today is profitability.
Where will you be allowed to make a profit in your industry?
Where is the profit zone today? Where will it be tomorrow?
The profit zone is the area of your economic neighborhood where you are allowed to earn a profit.
To reach and operate in the profit zone is the goal of every company.

Am I managing for market share, or for profit?
Is the market share I own profitable and alive, or is it profitless and dead?

Fast-growing industries such as PC manufacturing, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and software have each produced scores of terminally unprofitable companies.
By contrast, no-growth or low-growth industries have produced some of the most successful companies in the world.
Coca-Cola achieved significant value growth in the low-growth beverage industry, as did General Electric (GE) in a collection of low-growth manufacturing industries, and Swatch in the low-growth watchmaking industry.

Contenders to match price reductions or lose customers to a lower-priced competitor. It creates no-profit zones.

No-profit zones come in various forms.
- value chain (distribution in computing or the grocery segment in carbonated beverages)
- individual customers (Wal-Mart or other large, powerful buyers)
- entire business models (hub-and-spoke airlines)

Start with the profit question ("Where will I be allowed to make a profit?") and work your way back.
1. What's most important to the customer?
2. Where can we make a profit?
3. How can we gain market share in that space?

If the business is to succeed, it must be designed in such a way that its key elements are aligned with customers' most important priorities. It must be designed for profitability.

A more extensive repertoire of value capture mechanisms than they ever have before: financing, ancillary products, solutions, downstream participation in the value chain, value sharing, licensing,

Which customers I choose depends on which customers will allow me to make a profit.

IBM, GM, Sears, Kodak, US Steel, United Airlines. The actual list is quite long. Market share leaders? Yes. Profitable? No.

In value migration, customers move from A to B, and the profit zone moves from A to B with them.
The incumbent stays at A. The newcomer builds a business design to go to B.

This value shift has occurred often:
from IBM to Microsoft and Intel
USX to Nucor
United Airlines to Southwest Air
Computer-vision to Parametric Technology
Folgers to Starbuck's
Kmart to Wal-Mart.

Norman Augustine's First Law: The best way to make a silk purse from a sow's ear is to begin with a silk sow. The same is true of money.

## forming an organization

Along with his keen instinct for turning a profit, a key ingredient in
Perot's success was his ability to build an organization. He recruited
self-starters like himself and let them operate with a minimum of
bureaucratic rules.

World's shortest procedural manual: "Do what makes sense."

Adopting the motto "whatever it takes," they put in excruciatingly long
hours on projects that sometimes kept them away from home for months at
a time.

His methods represent a veritable checklist of the techniques that can
be culled from studying the careers of the most successful moneymakers.
In most cases, he carried the concept far beyond limits that ordinary
mortals would find reasonable.

"What sets us apart," Walton said in explaining Wal-Mart's success, "is
that we train people to be merchants. We let them see all the numbers so
they know exactly how they're doing within the store and within the
company; they know their cost, their markup, their overhead, and their
profit."

## get a mentor

Know you need a mentor. The more ambitious you are, the more help you'll require. Prioritize a mentoring relationship. Seek out a good mentor just as you'd seek out a great location, a favorable contract, or a business partner. Make a list of the qualities you'd like to find in a mentor, and don't settle for the first person who comes along.

What can you do to return the favor? Your contribution may be something as simple as cleaning your mentor's office or doing errands-look for a need your mentor has and fill it.

Always be on the lookout for mentors; they may be in unlikely places. Join a professional organization. The more you circulate in your chosen field, the more likely you are to bump into potential mentors.

## knowing your customer

Imagine how your ideal customer feels when they arrive at your website:
What do they want to find there?
What will your product provide for them that they absolutely cannot live without?
What is best way to convey this message to them?
What will they respond to?
What elements naturally draw them in? Audio? Video? Images?
What is going to make them click a link?
How should you introduce your product to your customer? What should your copy say on the first page they see?
What is going to convince them to provide you with their email address?
What is going to convince them to purchase your product? To help understand what motivates your ideal customer, think about the following questions:
What keeps your customers awake at night?
What are they afraid of?
What are they angry about?
What are their top three daily frustrations?
What do they desire most?
Is there a built-in bias to the way they make decisions? (example: engineers are exceptionally analytical)
Do they have their own jargon?
Who else has tried to sell them something similar? How have they failed or

## legal framework

In April 2008, Vermont became the first U.S. state to allow a new type of business called the "low-profit limited liability corporation." Dubbed an L3C, this entity is a corporation - but not as we typically think of it. L3C operate like a for-profit business generating at least modest profits, but its primary aim is to offer significant social benefits. Three other U.S. states have followed Vermont's lead.
