IoT is a bit of a gimmick

- it's just giving every device an IP address
- however, it's a good way to brand, based on the "everything's connected" emotional association
- it also opens up a wall of cybersecurity issues

Radio towers can relay across _each other_ (for non-consumer purposes) by sending long-range microwaves.

ISP: REDDIT COMMENT
I don't work there anymore, but I used to work for a cable internet ISP. You weren't supposed to know this, but when customers complained about slow hardwired speeds, we'd show up and pretend to do something, knowing full well that the issue was our nodes being oversaturated everywhere. But we would never tell you. We eventually introduced something called "Power Boost" to mask the problem by skewing speed tests. Your first 5-20 seconds would be uncapped bandwidth and you would think you were getting a quality product when you weren't.

NOTE: an SSH tunnel is a de facto VPN connection as soon as you include a proxy
