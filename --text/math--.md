[TeachYourselfCS1] Develop a working understanding of discrete mathematics:
    - logic
    - combinatorics and probability
    - set theory
    - graph theory (MAKE SURE TO ADD INTO THE MATH PAGE, AS THERE'S NOW A REF ON TS)
    - a little of the number theory informing cryptography
    - also, linear algebra can be useful in computer graphics and machine learning

Percentages are reversible. Working out 4% of 50 will give you the same result as 50% of 4

NOTE: go through basic mathematics (e.g., addition, multiplication, exponents, decimals) and their core philosophical parsing

- don't forget to indicate irrational numbers

The Sumerians base-6 system bestowed on us the division of the day into
twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360 degrees.

More signs were added to the Sumerian system, gradually transforming it
into a full script that we today call cuneiform.

Other full scripts were developed in China around 1200 BC and in Central
America around 1000-500 BC.

0 to 9 are known as Arabic numerals even though they were first invented
by the Hindus. But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded
India they encountered the system, understood its usefulness, refined
it, and spread it through the Middle East and then to Europe.

If doing any mathematical thing at all, find some practical example for
which it would be useful.
For example: There's a flagpole, and there's a rope that comes down from
the top. When you hold the rope straight down, it's a meter longer than
the pole, and when you pull the rope out tight, it's 1.75 meters from
the base of the pole. How high is the pole?
When somebody is explaining something that I'm trying to understand: I
keep making up examples.
I construct something which fits all the conditions.
They would tell me the general problem they were working on, and would
begin to write a bunch of equations. "Wait a minute," I would say. "Is
there a particular example of this general problem?" "Why yes; of
course." "Good. Give me one example." That was for me: I can't
understand anything in general unless I'm carrying along in my mind a
specific example and watching it go.
I have the specific, physical example of what he's trying to analyze,
and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the thing. So
when the equation says it should behave so-and-so, and I know that's the
wrong way around, I jump up and say, "Wait! There's a mistake!"

I learned to use one method, and I used that one damn tool again and
again. So because I was self-taught using that book, I had peculiar
methods of doing integrals. The result was, when guys had trouble doing
a certain integral, it was because they couldn't do it with the standard
methods they had learned in school. Then I come along and try
differentiating under the integral sign, and often it worked. So I got a
great reputation for doing integrals, only because my box of tools was
different from everybody else's, and they had tried all their tools on
it before giving the problem to me.

I used to enjoy doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to play with
it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn't have to do with
whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but
whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with.
I'd see water running out of a faucet growing narrower, and wonder if I
could figure out what determines that curve. I found it was rather easy
to do. I didn't have to do it; it wasn't important for the future of
science; somebody else had already done it. That didn't make any
difference: I'd invent things and play with things for my own entertainment.
When I felt I was burned out and will never accomplish anything, I
decided I'm going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without
worrying about any importance whatsoever.
It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like
uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. I almost tried
to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing, but
ultimately there was.

A long time ago an older and well known number theorist made some disparaging remarks about Paul Erdos' work. You admire contributions to mathematics as much as I do, and I felt annoyed when the older mathematician flatly and definitively stated that all of Erdos' work could be reduced to a few tricks which Erdos repeatedly relied on in his proofs. What the number theorist did not realize is that other mathematicians, even the very best, also rely on a few tricks which they use over and over. Take Hilbert. The second volume of Hilbert's collected papers contains Hilbert's papers in invariant theory. I have made a point of reading some of these papers with care. It is sad to note that some of Hilbert's beautiful results have been completely forgotten. But on reading the proofs of Hilbert's striking and deep theorems in invariant theory, it was surprising to verify that Hilbert's proofs relied on the same few tricks. Even Hilbert had only a few tricks!

<summary>Math tricks:</summary>
<ul><li>Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit by doubling the number and adding 28</li>
<li>Calculate percentages by dividing the number by 10 and multiplying it by 1/10 of the percent (e.g., 40% of 300 is 4.0 x 30, or 120)</li>
<li>Calculate 15% for tips by dividing the number by 10 and then adding a half (e.g., 15% of 25.40 is 2.54 + 1.27 = 3.81)</li>
<li>Multiply large numbers by dividing on the same side of the formula (e.g., 48 x 7 is also 24 x 14, 12 x 28, 6 x 56, 3 x 112, or 336)</li>
<li>When multiplying, split up factors to figure them out faster (e.g., 68 x 3 is the same as (60 x 3) + (8 x 3), or 204)</li>
<li>Convert your approximate hourly wage into a salary by doubling and adding three zeros, then convert back by halving and removing three zeros.</li></ul>

Many kids would learn to love mathematics if they had some investment in it.
