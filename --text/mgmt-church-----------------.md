In 1st Corinthians 11 Paul the super scribe who had been killing people

PAUL THE MOST HUMBLE APOSTLE WHO CALLS HIMSELF LIKE A BLOODY ABORTED APOSTLE…

In 1 Corinthians 11 he says you hold to the traditions of Christ…

The two pieces of literature

MOST RESPECTED

In the entire world.. among all historians..

The most important literature outside of the canonized koine Greek New Testament?

The teaching of The twelve Apostles to the gentiles.. the Didache.

And

Justin martyr's first apology.

There is one

" tradition"

That clearly appears in BOTH of those writings..

"Confess your sins when you gather and do not begin praying if you have a troubled conscience"

" Admit your faults before communion so that your sacrifice is pure"

"We hold an open banquet agape feast for the community…

After everyone is filled..

WE DISMISS ALL VISITORS AND ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN BAPTIZED…

(This is actually where you get the term "Mass" from it's part of the word dismissal.. it's so weird that the term Mass is describing the moment when the visitors go away!)

After all visitors are dismissed the doors are locked and then the time of conscience cleansing revelation of the Holy Spirit and the communion is held..

"Do not allow an unbeliever to even SEE your communion meal"

Okay back to the topic

THE PASTOR… Is the person in our neighborhood who has been revealed by the Holy Spirit..

TO HEAR OUR AFFLICTIONS WEAKNESSES TROUBLES AND STORIES OF OUR BAD SPIRITS…

That person is applying themselves to the care of our souls!

THIS IS NOT A CONGREGATIONAL LEADER

OR AN ORGANIZATIONAL BUSINESS PERSON

WHO IS RUNNING A TEACHING SCHEDULE…

That stuff is the work of a deacon, a business person.

The local Shepherd is a neighborhood person who might not even be a Bible scholar but has the guts to operate in the spirit of Truth.

IF WE HAVE A CONFLICT

We can ask the shepherd of our communion group to take a walk and get some answers from God for us..

SINCE WE HAVE AGREED THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS SELECTED THAT PERSON WE TRUST THEM TO BE A VOICE OF HEAVEN IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND SKETCHY MATTERS…!

### Sunday worship - Austin Stucky

from Austin Stucky:

A loose definition of Church is merely the assembly of the saints. A more particular definition of Church is Christian Intentional Community.

The Sunday morning gathering was merely intended as the public expression of said community. An outreach program, a time where the Intentional Community of Believers is put on display. An opportunity to intersect with the local community. An opportunity for the general public to get a taste of what happens within the private communal group that does life together.

The epistles of Paul were written to Intentional Communal Groups that were patterned after this model. The Sunday model for church that we've adopted in the west, minus the intentionally of shared community throughout the week is a limited church of no lasting substance.

Private, regular, cloistered communion times where the presence of God is tangibly experienced and the Lord's Supper is administered via the loose oversight and direction of a body of elders becomes the focal point of the week.

In weekly honesty times where sins are confessed, problems are addressed and directed to the Holy Spirit, He answers corporately, not just individually. A private space where unclean spirits operating in the atmospheres of other believers are discerned and addressed via the laying on of hands. Yokes are broken.

The power of God will meet the church in America when she begins to cooperate with God in detaching herself from institutionalized western models of church that present barriers to true fellowship.
