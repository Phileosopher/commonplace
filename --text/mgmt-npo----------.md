#### New OpenAI board - Matt Levine

One [piece of news](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981848/sam-altman-back-open-ai-ceo-microsoft-board) is that Microsoft Corp. will have a non-voting observer seat on the new board of directors of OpenAI. The problem, when OpenAI's board [briefly fired](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-20/who-controls-openai) Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman, was that Microsoft didn't know about it in advance. Once Microsoft heard about Altman's firing, it took, like, four days to get him his job back; that was not all Microsoft's doing, but Microsoft clearly had something to do with it. "The investors don't exactly need a board seat if they have a practical veto over the board's biggest decisions," [I wrote yesterday](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-29/the-robots-will-insider-trade), "and the events of the last two weeks suggest that they do." 

On the other hand it is inconvenient and disruptive that Microsoft had to effectively veto Altman's firing after it happened? Better to be told first and head it off. Thus, board observer.

Here's [one other piece of news](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-board-takes-over-and-says-microsoft-will-have-observer-role-50e55b73), sort of, about the new board chair, Bret Taylor, "the former co-CEO of business-software giant Salesforce who also was the chairman of Twitter when it dealt with Elon Musk's ultimately successful takeover effort":

> OpenAI's board is unusual in that it isn't obligated to maximize shareholder value, but rather to fulfill a larger mission of advancing artificial intelligence for humanity's benefit. On its website, OpenAI says the board's "principal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors."
>
> Asked if OpenAI's board could revisit this structure, Taylor said: "I think it's a great question-probably not one for my first day on the job."

That's one possible answer! I mean, I guess technically it's a non-answer, but it's an interesting one. "Should you benefit humanity or your investors?" "Great question, not sure yet." There are other possible answers! "No, the nonprofit structure is at the core of what we do, this company is fundamentally about benefiting humanity, that's what the investors and employees signed up for, and that part is really nonnegotiable" is, for instance, an imaginable answer. You could imagine the old nonprofit board, as a condition of letting Altman back, demanding "look you can bring in new, more commercial directors, but the nonprofit structure has to stay." But they ... didn't do that? Apparently? And Taylor is, like, for-profit-curious?

Incidentally, when Taylor and the Twitter Inc. board agreed to sell to Musk, [I wrote a column](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-02/twitter-s-board-gave-up) about how the board made and described that decision. What was striking, to me, was that Twitter's then-CEO, Parag Agrawal, described the decision to sell as _purely_ doing what was in the best interests of shareholders, without any consideration of the product, the mission, the employees, etc. Agrawal [said to employees](https://www.platformer.news/inside-twitters-emotional-friday/):

> "This is the answer you don't want to hear, right?" Agrawal said. "Twitter is a public company owned by shareholders. There are other companies which may have other legal mechanics … Twitter is not one of those companies."

That is partly true, but not entirely true, and kind of grim. I wrote:

> A lot of people think of Twitter as a public utility, a public trust, "the town square," a company with an important social mission that many of its users and employees _and Elon Musk_ care about deeply. And its CEO and board of directors essentially can't bring themselves to talk about it. When employees asked him about what was best for the company, Agrawal could talk only about the shareholders. Elon Musk is not at all embarrassed to say that Twitter has an important public mission, which is why he's buying it. But its current management can't say that, which is why they're selling it.

And now the chairman of the Twitter board that sold to Musk is the chairman of OpenAI. Which definitely _does_ have other legal mechanics. For now.
