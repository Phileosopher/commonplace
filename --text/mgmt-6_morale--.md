(2017) Dumb Rules That Make Your Best People Want to Quit
TL;DR — Trust employees like the adults they are

don't try to make them "quiet quit"
- it is legitimately unethical to make their workplace hell so they quit on their own
- instead, candidly tell them that they'd do better elsewhere, and that there isn't any real chance of promotion or good pay raises at the company without specific things you wish them to do
- that way, they have incentive to act, but also may just leave if they can't rise to the challenge

(2020) Coherent and complex
> - Collaboration, it turns out, gets harder in proportion to two things: the level of coherence you demand from the output, and the complexity of the processes that create it.
> - Collaboration that creates incoherence is easy. You all just do whatever you want. Equally, collaboration on things that are not complex is easy. You can all see whether the log has been chopped or not, there is limited room for debate.
> - On the other hand, lets say that instead we first come up with a clear overarching plan for what we’re doing. This makes it much more likely the outcome will be coherent. But the price we pay is having to handle the complexity of the entire challenge all at once.
