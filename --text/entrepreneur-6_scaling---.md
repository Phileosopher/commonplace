## risks from going out of scope

More entrepreneurs get themselves into trobule by overreaching than exercising discipline.

Don't make another major investment until you have satisfied yourself that the company knows exactly how it will make money and what tactical actions will be required to do so consistently.

## staying mindful of customers

I was out to understand what made these stubborn small-town entrepreneurs tick.

when a customer says he returned a movie but the store's computer can't find it. The employee was trained to say, "No problem, our mistake," and to note the discrepancy on the customer's file. We had a three-strikes-and-you're-out policy.

30+ years of business wisdom into a single lesson: get to know your customers.

## the growth of a business

INFANCY

Unfortunately most business do what the owner wants as opposed to what the business needs.
It's easy to spot a business in infancy : the owner and business are one and the same.
Infancy ends when the owner realizes the business cannot continue to run the way it has been, that to survive it will have to change. This is where most business failures occur.

If your business depends on you, you don't own a business - you have a job. (and you're working for a lunatic)
The purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can create jobs for other people.

ADOLESCENCE

Error: Management by abdication ("To relinquish formally a high office or responsibility.") rather than delegation.
The process of deterioration where the number of the balls in the air is not only too much for you, but too much for your people as well.

BEYOND THE COMFORT ZONE

True trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith.
To know, one must understand.
To understand, one must have an intimate awareness of what conditions are truly present. What people know, do, want, are - and what they don't/aren't.
A business that "gets small again" is a business reduced to the level of its owner's personal resistance to change - its owner's comfort zone. (works and waits for something positive to happen)
Businesses that "get small again" die, implode.
Your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth.
To educate yourself so that, as your business grows, the foundation and structure can carry the additional weight.
** It's up to you to dictate your business's rate of growth by understanding the key processes that need to be performed, the key objectives that need to be achieved, the key position you're aiming for in the marketplace.
Write it down, clearly, so others can understand it. (If you can't, you don't own it!)

MATURITY

Maturity is not an inevitable result of the first two phases. It is not the end of a serial process. Great companies didn't end up as mature companies - they started out that way.
Mature company must also go through infancy and adolescence, but go through them in a different way. It's the perspective that makes the difference.
Very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was done. How it would act.
Unless you act that way from the beginning, you'll never get there. In order to become a great company, act like a great company long before it ever becomes one.
Every day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business. We didn't do business at IBM, we built one.
The very best businesses are fashioned after a model of a business that works.

How must the business work?
Business as a system for producing outside results - for the customer - resulting in profits.
Picture of a well-defined future, then comes back to the present with the intention of changing it to match the vision.

Survey the world and ask, "Where is the opportunity?"
Identify it, then go back to the drawing board and construct a solution to the frustration found in a group of customers.
Acts the way the customer needs it to act, not the Entrepreneur.
"How will my business look to the customer?" "How will my business stand out from all the rest?"
Within the customer is a continuing parade of changing wants, begging to be satisfied. Find out what those wants are, and what they will be in the future.

## types of pivots

"Pivot" sometimes is used incorrectly as a synonym for change. A pivot is a special kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth.

A CATALOG OF PIVOTS

A platform pivot. Instead of selling an application to one customer at a time, David envisioned a new growth model inspired by Google's AdWords platform. He built a self-serve sales platform where anyone could become a customer with just a credit card.

Zoom-in Pivot In this case, what previously was considered a single feature in a product becomes the whole product. A zoom-in pivot, refocusing the product on what previously had been considered just one feature of a larger whole.

Zoom-out Pivot In the reverse situation, sometimes a single feature is insufficient to support a whole product. In this type of pivot, what was considered the whole product becomes a single feature of a much larger product.

Customer Segment Pivot In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it is building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the type of customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is partially confirmed, solving the right problem, but for a different customer than originally anticipated. A customer segment pivot, keeping the functionality of the product the same but changing the audience focus. In other words, David went from being a business-to-consumer (B2C) company to being a business-to-business (B2B) company.

Customer Need Pivot: The problem we're trying to solve for them is not very important. However, because of this customer intimacy, we often discover other related problems that are important and can be solved by our team. The target customer has a problem worth solving, just not the one that was originally anticipated.

Platform Pivot A platform pivot refers to a change from an application to a platform or vice versa. Most commonly, startups that aspire to create a new platform begin life by selling a single application, the so-called killer app, for their platform. Only later does the platform emerge as a vehicle for third parties to leverage as a way to create their own related products.

Business Architecture Pivot: a startup switches architectures. Some companies change from high margin, low volume by going mass market (e.g., Google's search "appliance"); others, originally designed for the mass market, turned out to require long and expensive sales cycles.

Value Capture Pivot: capturing value is an intrinsic part of the product - and changes to the way a company captures value can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the business, product, and marketing strategies.

Engine of Growth Pivot: three primary engines of growth that power startups: the viral, sticky, and paid growth models. In this type of pivot, a company changes its growth strategy to seek faster or more profitable growth. Commonly but not always, the engine of growth also requires a change in the way value is captured.

Channel Pivot: the sales channel or distribution channel. For example, consumer packaged goods are sold in a grocery store, cars are sold in dealerships, and much enterprise software is sold (with extensive customization) by consulting and professional services firms. Often, the requirements of the channel determine the price, features, and competitive landscape of a product. A channel pivot is a recognition that the same basic solution could be delivered through a different channel with greater effectiveness.

It is precisely because of its destructive effect on sales channels that the Internet has had such a disruptive influence in industries that previously required complex sales and distribution channels, such as newspaper, magazine, and book publishing.

Technology Pivot: Occasionally, a company discovers a way to achieve the same solution by using a completely different technology. Technology pivots are much more common in established businesses.

Technology life cycle ideas of theorists such as Geoffrey Moore know certain later-stage pivots by the names he has given them: the Chasm, the Tornado, the Bowling Alley.

Modern managers cannot have escaped the deluge of recent books calling on them to adapt, change, reinvent, or upend their existing businesses. Many of the works in this category are long on exhortations and short on specifics.

## working with others

OLD tPA: Working With Others
- Never enter a partnership without a buy/sell agreement - no matter how well you know someone, you don't know when he/she will want to retire or leave
- People don't leave companies, they leave management - employees leave if they think they're not being valued or listened to, customers leave if they are dissatisfied with products and services, both reflect on management
- Persuade without power - you can get what you want with force, but instead learn to be kind, passionate, supportive and grateful
- Embrace your fears, and be courageous anyway - you're a bigger man for admitting what scares you, and a great man for following through despite those fears
- Get everyone involved - Incorporate everyone in goal-setting and strategic planning

## you might be lucky

I was smart enough to realize I was getting lucky.

The number-one killer of start-ups is when entrepreneurs confuse "being lucky" with "being smart."
You must possess the humility to distinguish one from the other.

There is a pseudo-scientific formula for creating business luck. And the key element is this:
Lucky things happen to entrepreneurs who start fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive companies.
Why?
Because lots of smart people will gather around companies with these qualities.
As it turns out, precious few of them exist.
And the vast majority of human beings, and certainly most of the smart ones, are constitutionally caring creatures who would, if given the chance, prefer to spend their valuable time in a positive setting contributing to the betterment of society rather than in a negative setting contributing to its detriment.
Shocking, I know, but true.
And when smart, inspired people gather around a fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive company, they work very hard.
And when smart, inspired people work very hard, serendipity ensues.
Serendipity-the faculty of making fortuitous discoveries by chance-causes lots of unexpected things to happen to a company.
Some of these unexpected things are good. Some are bad.
But because no one planned for the good things to happen, they appear as luck.
In other words, the best way to ensure that lucky things happen is to make sure that a lot of things happen.
It's really that simple.

My formula for getting lucky in business is reasonably simple:
Start a company that is fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive.
Create an aura of authenticity around your start-up by carefully crafting your mission and communicating it with charisma and passion.
Your company will quickly attract smart, inspired people who will work very hard.
Treat all these people fairly.
Provide them with a clear action plan and give them the latitude to exercise their creativity.

In applying this formula, the entrepreneur has two tasks:
1. Create an environment where smart people will gather
2. Be smart enough to stay out of the way and let luck happen.

Much of what makes a company fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive is not what the company's business model actually is, but how the entrepreneur communicates the mission of the company.

The ability to focus and be patient is typically associated not with entrepreneurs but with managers.
Entrepreneurs want results immediately, while managers are happy to wait.

Start-ups are like extreme-skiing runs. The person who wins is the one who screws up the least and doesn't die.

90 percent of Tripod's value was in the amount of press we received in such a concentrated period of time.

The quickest way to completely tank your company is to wholeheartedly believe what you read in the press, especially if it happens to be about you. The vast majority of the press is not interested in covering what is actually happening. They are interested in covering what they think people want to think is actually happening.
