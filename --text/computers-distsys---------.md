> Please, developers, don’t get smug. I’m starting with you because you’re a core part of the problem here. Go back and re-read the definitions of DevOps … I’ll wait … You have to notice one salient point. Nowhere does it say, “Developers rule the world”, or “Developers have ‘SA’ privileges”, or “We get to ignore the Operations side of IT and do anything we want”. No, instead, it talks about cooperation.
