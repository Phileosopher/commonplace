APPLICATION: While discrimination usually implies shame, we can discriminate more favorably toward things than others may deserve. The clearest indication of this is when we judge [creations](creations.md) by [who their creator is](identity.md) instead of the [quality](values-quality.md) of the piece itself.


## Discrimination

When we interpret favor or shame immediately as part of our [bias](mind-bias.md), we're discriminating. These values can include favoring race, [age](maturity.md), [gender](gender.md), or implied [social class](classes.md). Unless we [analyze](logic.md) what people say and ignore their reputation, we're *always* [unfairly](morality-justice.md) biased.

We discriminate *all the time* for many reasons:

- What we [imagine](imagination.md) others may think
- [Past pain](hardship-ptsd.md) that may not have present implications
- What we perceive others may be able to [do](results.md), often defined by their [aptitude](humanity.md), [status](groups-member.md) in specific [groups](groups-small.md), or our [understanding](understanding.md) of their [maturity](maturity.md)
- [Physical attractiveness](gender.md), distinguishing features like clothing, and [hygiene](people-image.md)
- Even when we've tried to remove bias, we often discriminate on [ideas](values.md) alone as theories without any consideration for [history](trends.md)

A stereotype is [habitual](habits.md) and [unfair](morality-justice.md) discrimination. Because we're not conscious of it, we make silly overgeneralizations that lose any sense of [logic](logic.md). People can often address it with [humor](humor.md), but when people have suffered [pain](hardship-ptsd.md) from the stereotype (or [others can benefit from it](politics-leftism.md)), they'll miss the joke.

APPLICATION: When we want to [influence](power-influence.md) others who don't want to [understand](understanding.md), we're wasting our time. It's particularly difficult for us to disengage if we're fighting [past trauma](hardship-ptsd.md).

Stereotypes are inherently amoral because we're not aware of them when we build them (and are therefore naive). However, if we persist with them after we're made aware of their inaccuracy, we are committing a low-level type of [evil](morality-evil.md).
