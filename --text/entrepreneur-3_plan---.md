## not always necessary

60% of Inc. 500 CEOs had not even written business plans before
launching their companies.
- THIS IS FINE, BUT CAN BE VERY RISKY IF YOU DON'T DO IT RIGHT
- HOWEVER, IT'S THE NATURE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR'S PERSONALITY TO LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, YIELDING SEVERE RISK/REWARD

"I don't believe in market research. Somebody once told me that the only
thing you need is a customer. Instead of asking all the questions, I'd
try and make some sales."

Bill Gross: Had an idea for selling cars online. He hired a CEO for 90
days and gave him a mission: Sell one car.

This preference for testing, rather than planning, was one of the most
striking differences between entrepreneurs and corporate executives.

The ideal entrepreneur: In character a judicious fusion of the utopian and the practical, he or she would succeed not only in identifying an important need but also in mastering the challenges of bureaucracy and finance in order to give the resolution of that need an institutional form, and thereby affect others' lives in ways that theory alone could never do.

Tappers estimated that listeners would identify the song correctly, on
average, 50 percent of the time. In fact, listeners guessed correctly
only 2.5 percent of the time.

The lens problem affects anyone who has unique knowledge of anything:
the boss who understands a proposal inside out and is trying to convey
the ideas to new clients, the inventor who knows precisely why her
invention is so important speaking to impatient venture capitalists, or
the coworker who is "just teasing" a new hire who knows nothing of the
teaser's friendly intentions. The expert's problem is assuming that
what's so clear in his or her own mind is more obvious to others.

He first asked a farmer to name a price for the drilling rights on his
land. Then, Hunt hurried to town and offered the rights to an oil
driller at a higher price. Once he had both sides of the trade in place,
he would buy and sell nearly simultaneously, pocketing a profit without
risking a nickel.

## paying the workers

A company does better the less it pays the CEO.

## pricing

Lawful Sources of Pricing Power
1. Brand identity
2. Patent protection
3. Dominant market share
4. Sustainable cost advantage

Price is a signal.
"Cheap" is another way to say "scared".
When you're the cheapest, you're not promising change. You're promising the same, but cheaper.

## sourcing

- there are MAJOR problems with sourcing things overseas, especially when that country lies or is a dictatorship

## the scale of the plan - growth

The devout pursuit of market share may be the single greatest creator of no-profit zones in the economy.

The euphoria of being in a high-growth environment blocks out the reality that growth creates a much higher management challenge.

The curse of growth arises when a business grows by stretching its business design to serve customers that the business design was not intended to serve.

Activities that were once valuable turn profitless.
Value migrates toward activities that are more important to customers - activities where profit is possible.

## the scale of the plan

If you can start small, do it
- Because of technology, startups in many industries are extremely affordable to begin, sometimes only the cost of food and rent!

Achievable: take 10% of your forecast, make this your goal, and blow it away.

Postpone touchy-feely goals. Companies that reach on measurable goals are happy.

Marvin Minsky:
Pick a big enough project, something that's really hard, something that over the years you can work on.

## why a business plan matters

Entrepreneurs are apt to stick with a flawed business plan they spent months drafting.

The more important reason to write a business plan is to force the management team to solidify the objectives (what), strategies (how), and tactics (where, when, who).

When you write your plan, act as if you know exactly what you're going to do. You are deliberate.
