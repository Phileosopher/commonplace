## VPN_Guides

### What VPN should I get?

A paid VPN is recommended, as there are no good free ones that allow torrent traffic, not to mention that most will mine data from you for marketing purposes. You should seek a VPN that does not store connection and usage logs. Within this subreddit and Reddit as a whole, you will find aggressive VPN marketing tactics by nearly all top popular VPN services. Do your own research. You will often encounter the suggestion to visit [That One Privacy Site](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-section/). Do not rely blindly on the chart and look up each individual VPN's ToS. Many VPNs offer trials and refunds, use these to your benefit when determining which VPN best suits your needs.

### Extra information on VPNs

Popular VPN services aggressively market themselves on Reddit. Do not subscribe to a service just because Reddit deems it popular, cheap, or because it hits the front page. You are entrusting an entity with your personal data; do your own research. Keep in mind that VPN experiences are completely anecdotal. Someone's experience with a particular VPN may vary from location, servers, operating systems, downloads speeds, etc...

With that said, below are some resources with which you may begin your research. Most if not all popular VPNs offer trials and/or immediate refunds. Use them to your advantage in your quest to find a VPN that works best for you. Don't forget to also read their ToS!

Beware of free VPNs if you plan on using one for online purchases or to log into websites with sensitive data. Many free VPNs are able to provide their free services because they data mine, interpose ads in searches, etc...

Beware of pirating VPNs. You wouldn't pirate a condom?

One alternative to buying a VPN is hosting your own.
