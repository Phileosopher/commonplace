In a hostile, depersonalized net environment, identity is one's
liability. What were the kids' weapons against me? My name, my address,
my home. What does putting a picture of someone's house online really
imply, after all? We know where you live. We can get you, the real
you-while you have no idea who we are.

the anonymous status of people in an online group engenders crowd
behavior. They have nothing to fear as individuals, and get used to
taking actions from a distance and from secrecy. As a result, they
exacerbate digital technology's most dehumanizing tendencies, and end up
behaving angrily, destructively, and automatically. They go from being
people to being a mob.

The way to dampen the effects of this problem is not to retreat into
anonymity ourselves, but to make being real and identifiable the norm.
As in the real world, the fewer people who know each other, the more
dangerous the neighborhood.

The real way to "go social," if they wanted to, would not be to
accumulate more page friends or message followers, but rather to get
their friends and followers to befriend and follow one another. That's
how to create a culture in a peer-to-peer, networked medium.

## Ally advice

Protect yourself from fraud with these tips.
Cybercrime and fraud are serious threats to your personal information, and lately scams are on the rise. Please use caution when discussing your Ally accounts over the phone or via text message as you could be interacting with a scammer, disguised as an Ally employee.

Keep in mind, while we do make follow-up calls occasionally, we don't call or text our customers out of the blue.

Tips to protect yourself:

    Deny requests for a password. We don't call or text you and ask for your Ally account password to verify your account. These scammers will.
    Ask questions. Asking questions like "When's the last time I called you?" may prompt the fraudster to hang up.
    Call us directly and report fraud. If someone calls or texts you for your Ally Bank information, don't respond and call us at 1-833-226-1520 to report it.
    Stay aware. Fraudsters are constantly changing the ways they try to cheat you out of your money. Learn how to protect yourself against the latest smishing and social media scams.
    If you use Zelle, Ally sends text messages from a short 6-digit code. Fraudsters will sometimes send text messages from 10-digit phone numbers claiming to be Ally. If you receive a suspicious message, don't respond and, instead, call the number on the back of your Ally card.

Tips to protect yourself:

    We will never call or text you to ask for your Ally Bank account username, password, card number, or your one-time passcode (OTP).
    Call us directly and report fraud. If someone calls or texts you for your Ally Bank information, don’t respond and call us at 1-877-247-2559 to report it.
    If you use Zelle, Ally sends text messages from a short 6-digit code. Fraudsters will sometimes send text messages from 10-digit phone numbers claiming to be Ally. If you receive a suspicious message, don’t respond and call us at 1-877-247-2559 to report it.
    Pause and read text messages fully. Fraudsters will sometimes act with a sense of urgency - trying to trick you into acting fast.

At Schwab, we’re dedicated to shedding light on the often unseen and unspoken issue of elder abuse, which includes physical, emotional, and financial mistreatment of older adults.

Here’s what you can do to help protect the seniors in your life:

- Communicate: Maintain open lines of communication with elderly family members about their financial matters.
- Report suspicions: If you suspect that an elderly person is being financially exploited, it's crucial to report it. You can contact local adult protective services, law enforcement, and financial institutions where they hold accounts.
- Talk about money: Talk to your aging parents about money and creating a financial plan to manage their affairs. Learn more at [Aging Parents? 5 Money Topics to Discuss | Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/aging-parents-5-money-topics-to-discuss).

## schwab advice

Stay safe this tax season: Your guide to preventing check fraud.

As we step into tax season, it's crucial to stay vigilant against financial crimes that could affect your financial security and peace of mind.

Check fraud, which involves illegal activities like forging, stealing, altering, or creating counterfeit checks, is a prevalent issue, especially during tax season. It's important to be aware of how this can happen, the signs to look out for, and understanding how to mitigate the associated risks.
Here are six tips you can use to protect yourself and your assets:
1. Sign up for USPS email alerts:
Use the USPS's Informed Delivery service for daily emails on incoming mail. It's free at USPS.com.
2. Request direct deposits:
Instead of receiving physical checks, request direct deposits into your account. It's safer and quicker.
3. Pay bills electronically:
For added security, use electronic or mobile payment methods like e-checks or ACH payments.
4. Track your checks:
Follow up on undelivered checks promptly and notify your financial institution of any missing checks.
5. Reduce outgoing mail theft:
Take your mail directly to the post office or drop it into a secure mailbox before the last collection.
6. Guard against alterations:
Use permanent black ink and avoid leaving blank spaces on payee or amount lines.

If you suspect fraud:
- Contact your financial institution and local law enforcement to file a report.
- If mail was involved, report it to the United States Postal Inspection Service at uspis.gov/report or call 1-877-876-2455.
 
Your financial safety and security are our priority.
- We've shared these tips with you as these are steps you can take to significantly reduce the risk of check fraud and ensure your financial well-being remains intact during this busy season and beyond. If you ever suspect fraud related to your Schwab account, we'll be with you every step of the way.
- For more security tools, resources, and steps you can take to help safeguard your personal information and assets, visit SchwabSafe®. We're dedicated to protecting your account and working with you to make it even more secure.
