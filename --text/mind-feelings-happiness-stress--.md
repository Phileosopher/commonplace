apologies are an indemnity contract:
- I, the person who is liable for the thing that has been stated by you, will formally declare that I have failed. My indication of failure should represent as restitution, but I will in good faith assume responsibility for all reasonable consequences of the action I have committed, and will work to resolve it.

in the absence of an apology, that's why we must release, which is basically taking on a loss:
- In the absence of sufficient consideration to indemnify my situation, I am abdicating control over the circumstance. It is God's/nobody's responsibility, and I exonerate myself from any necessary further action. I will take the following steps to ensure I don't have a future loss of a similar nature.
