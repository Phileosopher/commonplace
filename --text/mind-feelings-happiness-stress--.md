apologies are an indemnity contract:
- I, the person who is liable for the thing that has been stated by you, will formally declare that I have failed. My indication of failure should represent as restitution, but I will in good faith assume responsibility for all reasonable consequences of the action I have committed, and will work to resolve it.

in the absence of an apology, that's why we must release, which is basically taking on a loss:
- In the absence of sufficient consideration to indemnify my situation, I am abdicating control over the circumstance. It is God's/nobody's responsibility, and I exonerate myself from any necessary further action. I will take the following steps to ensure I don't have a future loss of a similar nature.

I have a working theory on the relationship between faith and stress:

1.  We have a limited supply of trust that the unknown things will work out (i.e., "[faith](https://gainedin.site/trust/)").
2.  That supply gets replenished in different ways: encouragement from others, reading Scripture, prayer, and so on. Each person has different approaches to it.
3.  When stressors come, they deplete faith until we have no more left.
4.  At the point of faithlessness (which is not difficult to arrive at), the stressors travel through our [emotions](https://gainedin.site/emotions/) and interpret within our [soul](https://theologos.site/people/) as stress.
5.  Unless we're directly lashing out (which is [culturally](https://gainedin.site/culture/) inappropriate and often wrong), there's a type of "plumbing" our stress travels through in our minds.
6.  We can deaden the pain of the stress through various [substances](https://adequate.life/substances/). This is only remotely good if it materially improves our situation, but can more often become an [addiction](https://gainedin.site/addiction/), especially in the scope of [prior trauma](https://gainedin.site/ptsd/).
7.  If we direct giant chunks of that stress into something meaningful (e.g., [working out](https://adequate.life/weight/), art, writing, performance arts), we can become *absurdly* effective.
8.  However, there is still latent stress in the plumbing.
9.  If we don't get rid of that latent stress through some form of [meditation](https://adequate.life/awareness/) or release, it will sink into our subconscious as some form of [dysregulation](https://gainedin.site/feelings/) (e.g., anxiety, depression, bitterness).
