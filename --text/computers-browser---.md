## social network design

In effect, the power of an internet user is defined by how much time they spend curating their communication to ride the waves of an algorithm. This system creates a power dynamic defined by how much they're not doing other more important things, alongside the defined agenda that a social media algorithm has been programmed to endorse. When people consume that every day, it creates a minority of people who do nothing but work themselves into an agitated froth with not much else to show for it.

## web apps

REDDIT COMMENT
Making an application run in multiple platforms (Android, macOS, Windows, etc) is a huge pain, but what do all platforms have in common? They can all run Chrome, and Chrome can run portable (but slow) code.
So what do developers do?
Developers write applications as standalone web pages and bundle a whole copy of the Chrome* browser to view that "web page". The application now takes hundreds of megabytes of storage, eats RAM like candy, and every interaction is massively slowed down because it has to go through so many layers.
The address bar is hidden, and the right click menu is replaced, but it's still a web browser under the hood.
They are basically saving developer time by wasting your time and device resources. That's a big reason why modern applications (Teams, Discord, Spotify, etc) feel so slow.
* Technically "Chromium", since it's missing some features like Google account log in. The most popular framework that uses this technique is Electron.
