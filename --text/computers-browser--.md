We recommend [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).
It is windows native and performs great. Privacy in browsers is mostly marketing. The best privacy practice is to use good extensions and use your brain while surfing the web. Edge offers:
- Sleeping Tabs
- Startup Boost
- Browser Sync
- SmartScreen
- Password Monitor
- Tracking Prevention
- Vertical Tabs
- Collections
- Web Capture
- Immersive Reader
- Automatic Coupon code finding during online checkout
