## secret societies

It's only human nature that the following will happen:
1. [groups](groups-large) will diverge into multiple [classes] of social importance
2. the people at the top class will make little associations and clubs to [identify] with each other
3. [parents](family) in those groups will want to give their [kids](maturity) an opportunity to succeed by giving them extra advantage to join those groups
4. eventually, assuming the entire society doesn't utterly [collapse](trends) or [get destroyed](war), only people in the special club will accept people they trust into their club and exclude everyone else
5. if they've been around long enough, they'll have enough members in enough positions of [power]
6. when individuals have power, they want more of it

conspiracy theorists go off the rails from the following:
1. they identify indisputable facts
2. they draw [holistic connections](feelings) that aren't that rigorous or easy to prove
3. they conclude something that's downright preposterous
4. they share that preposterous thing, with their original observations
5. the original observations are clouded out by the conclusions
e.g., the World Trade Center may have not been strictly a plane crash, and the planes would normally have been shot down, etc etc, and that's why it's the Reptilians conspiring with the mole people and Elvis to prevent us from ever landing on the moon
