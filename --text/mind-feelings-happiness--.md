Practice Gratitude
Gratitude can be an elixir for victimhood. Gratitude is not the naive insistence that the world is a perfectly delightful place and that everything is going to go well. Gratitude is a practice. It is a moral virtue. The virtuous part of gratitude is the courage to find light in even the darkest place that can guide you through. The willingness to and the understanding of that is a practice. 
A few years ago, my wife was extraordinarily, fatally ill. During that time, she diligently strived to look for what she could be grateful for in each moment of each day. This practice was not only an aide to her physically and immunologically, as it helped her be less stressed, but it also helped her spiritually. This is very often the case in situations such as hers, in situations that people are facing serious illness. 
Ask questions about gratitude, and give others space to practice it as well. Be grateful for the love and support you receive when that love and support is genuine because they will be of genuine aid to you. And when you practice gratitude, know that it is not a kind of naivety; it is a courageous practice. Ask questions about gratitude, and give others space to practice it as well.

Gather At The Table With Gratefulness 
When people sit at a table, they share food. This is strange; humans are the only animals who formally share food. But it is also normal — so normal in some ways that no one notices its strangeness. The fact that people can actually share food, even when they are hungry, is really quite remarkable.
The dinner table represents a kind of nostalgic ideal. The Old Testament places an immense emphasis on hospitality to a stranger, but the same principle applies within your family. At the dinner table, you get to share your day. You each get to talk and to listen. It is a place to inculcate manners into your children. It is a place for everyone to keep track of everyone else and what is going on in their day, week, and so forth. Sharing food at the table is a time and place for everyone to come together and discuss the separate elements of their life. 
Then, a mealtime prayer offers an opportunity to be grateful. People often incorrectly think of prayer as a kind of wish or confuse it as a time to ask for favors, but it is actually a practice. You can practice gratitude, and there are certainly reasons to do so — one of which being that you notice what you have for which to be grateful. In other words, the practice makes you much more aware. It is also a way to stave off resentment. If you become an expert at the very useful practice of gratitude, your life will become much better.

Create And Move Toward A Goal To Experience Positive Emotion
There are different types of positive emotion, but enthusiasm and joy  — not to be confused with satiation — are fully dependent on observing progression toward a valued goal. Separately, the feeling of satiation, or obtainment, occurs when you obtain something you want and feel satisfied. (Satiation involves a completely different neurochemical system.) But enthusiasm and joy, which are often associated with happiness, manifest themselves when you are moving toward a valued goal. Therefore, if you do not prioritize your goals, then you do not experience positive emotion. 
In terms of forward movement, positive emotion is almost all its motivation because the embodied manifestation of positive emotion is movement toward a valued goal. That is the purpose of positive emotion; that is why you experience positive emotion. The emotional implication of being a creature that can move toward goals is positive emotion. If you lack a goal, you will not experience positive emotion. In like manner, if you are inclined to accomplish 10 tasks at once, you will accomplish none. Put another way, if you have 100 goals and cannot prioritize them, then every goal has 1% of the significance necessary to move you forward. To be maximally motivated, you must know the reason for your actions. 
Consciousness is an incredibly narrow channel. Generally, we can only concentrate on one thing at a time — because we can only act out one thing at a time. This means that not only do you need to prioritize your perception, but you must also prioritize your actions. By doing so, you create a structure of priority, which is a structure of compared value.

How To Experience Positivity In Life
In order to stop your current anxiety system from tagging older anxiety systems, you have to do something about it. Otherwise, you will continue to be tortured by negative memories forever — because that is how an alarm system works. 
You may need to return to your past memories for clarity and understanding. You should figure out how the situation happened, and ask what role you played. Your role may, indeed, have been minor, but the degree to which you were involved does not necessarily matter, as that is not the point of your discovery. The point is that you do not want to be put in the same vulnerable position again; instead, you want to strengthen yourself however you can. 
If it is a really old memory from your childhood, for instance, you probably have a variety of techniques you could use now — because you are not a child now. However, you must update the part of your brain that still thinks you are four years old. It is possible that parts of yourself are still caught in a traumatic childhood experience. Thus, you need to know where you are now, so to speak, to then address the memory. 
When you decide to move from one point to another — specifically, somewhere slightly better — that is good. The positive emotion system that runs on dopamine will respond neurochemically for the sole reason you are going somewhere worth going. This system, deeply rooted in your brain’s exploratory circuitry, is happy when you have somewhere to go; then, it is happy when you are progressing.

## parsing the past

with the events that occurred, you were:
    - innocent: you therefore endured [hardship]
    - guilty: you [sinned] and it's the logical consequences of that action
next, how you responded:
    - well: it [pleased God](God's will)
    - poorly: it displeased God
this parses into 4 domains:
    - innocent, and responded well - authentic suffering
        the best situation to be in
            face it honestly and openly
            acknowledge the confusion and hurt
            love God enough to cry out to Him
            ask others to help
            there isn't always a direct link between sin and suffering
            use the suffering to deepen your walk with God
            He only gives you temptation you can withstand
            treat it as a spiritual mission
    - innocent, responded poorly - humble analysis
        needs repentance and remedial actions to consider what had happened
        ask how you responded:
            1. did you return evil for evil?
                vengeance is the Lord's
            2. did you develop bitterness toward God?
            3. did you develop an unbiblical view of people?
            4. have you developed an unbiblical view of yourself?
            5. should you confront the person who sinned against you? and if so, have you done it?
            6. if you confronted the person who sinned against you and they asked forgiveness, have you done it?
    - guilty, responded well - joyful remembrance
        our actions bring us closer to God and others
        God is entirely faithful to forgive our sins
        there are MANY verses that indicate this (matt 26:27-28, rom 5:9, eph 1:7, col 1:20, heb 10:19, 1pe 1:18-19, rev 5:9)
        we can choose what we think about (eph 4:23, phil 4:8, 1pe 1:13, ps 42:5)
        there are 4 reasons people get stuck in the past:
            1. a lack of genuine repentance
                there is a MAJOR difference between worldly and godly sorrow (2 cor 7:9-10)
            2. the fear of man (pro 29:25, rom 8:31-39)
            3. unwillingness to leave our sin
            4. losing our awe of God's forgiving grace
    - guilty, responded poorly - honest self-confrontation
        creates additional sin, is a HUGE moral risk

5 reasons we refuse to admit our past sin:
    pride - accept that you've failed
    stubbornness - just own that you need to ask forgiveness
    fear - you're over-reacting
    foolishness - you may be doing what seems right to you, but is a bad idea
    misplaced desires - you may have desires that are being fulfilled wrongly:
        never make yourself vulnerable by admitting failures
        have the approval of people
        always have power over others
        always have the upper hand
        get back at the other person for what they did
        never let the person hurt them again

indicate how "rest" goes farther than simply "sleep"
- maybe rename the guide "how to rest"?
