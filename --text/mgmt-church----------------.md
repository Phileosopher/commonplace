### Jesus must be involved

If Jesus launched His ministry today, most of us wouldn’t follow Him.
Let me prove it:
🟡 He had no title — He wasn’t a pastor, bishop, or apostle. We’d question His legitimacy and authority because He didn’t come through the ranks or wear the titles we respect.
🟡 He was only 3 years in ministry — We'd say He wasn't seasoned enough to lead or “cover” anyone.
🟡 He was unmarried and childless — So we’d say He lacked the understanding or experience to speak on marriage, parenting, or family matters.
🟡 He only had 12 followers — And one of them betrayed Him. We'd call that poor leadership and say He lacked discernment.
🟡 He didn’t launch a church — He taught in borrowed spaces—homes, synagogues, hillsides. We'd call Him unstable, unestablished, and illegitimate.
🟡 He had no ordination — No license. No certificate. No spiritual father to co-sign His calling. We’d call Him rebellious or rogue for operating without formal covering or denominational approval.
🟡 He flipped tables and challenged religious systems — We’d label Him bitter, divisive, and disrespectful. We’d likely even say He had a spirit of offense and needed deliverance.
🟡 He healed on the Sabbath — He didn’t follow protocol. He didn’t ask for permission. He didn’t wait for the right setting. We’d accuse Him of being out of order and dishonoring spiritual authority.
🟡 He said He heard directly from God — We’d call Him unsubmitted, spooky, or dangerous. We might even say things like "he's hearing from a spirit but not the holy spirit"
Truth is…
Our traditions would’ve told Jesus to sit down.
Religion would’ve told Him to go submit under a seasoned leader.
And much of the Church would’ve disqualified Him before He ever preached the Kingdom.
The same Jesus we'll be preaching and crying about the next few weeks wouldn’t be welcomed if He walked in today.
(And before anyone flips the narrative—this isn’t bashing the Church. I am, however, questioning some of our norms.)
I do want us to be reminded: Jesus came to establish a Kingdom—not validate a system. And the Kingdom was disruptive in every way to the systems of His time.
Sometimes, disruption is the doorway to revival and realignment.
We don’t need more polish. We don’t need more titles. And we don’t need more platforms. We do need more power, more truth, and more presence.
May we have eyes to see Him—even when He shows up in ways we don’t expect.  The courage to follow—even when it breaks our traditions to do it. And an ear to hear—even when His voice confronts what we’ve built in His name.
God is kind.

### keeping it small - Austin Stucky

The spark notes version is.. the communion groups are centered around the belief that there is tangible power in the communion table as one of the primary means that God uses to form Christ in us individually and corporately and that fellowship gatherings should be done around that meal as the focal point within closed private gatherings.

Following a time of personal confession (just as the OT priest would read off the sin list of the people before the slaying of the lamb at the Passover Seder) and the discerning of individual demons that are afflicting group members around the table. That's affectionally known as "conscious cleansing time" or the "discerning of the body" before the meal per 1 Cor 11.

The substance of what defines the "church" is in the home gatherings of the handful of families who regularly meet as well as the singles who join themselves to the families. Each individual home group then selects a family man who has a proclivity towards the watching over of men's souls who is nominated as an over shepherd. Then these regular home groups collectively come together once a week on Sunday morning for an act of public worship where curious people can get a taste of what the community is all about and be immersed into the different home groups all of which have their own distinct flavor.

The idea being that this is the original structure that God instituted for men to appropriate the cleansing and atonement for sin, and keep one's soul undefiled and protected against afflicting unclean spirits.

And then he's got a bunch of fun ideas on the side that he thought up that helps encourage honest conversations within community that aren't necessarily biblical per se, but can be useful pointers in pursuit of fulfilling Christian relationships within the brotherhood/sisterhood

The idea is that each home group cluster would have one or two Christian businesses birthed out of them that would allow for the men to work together and their wife's to gather together regularly and assist in childcare, homeschooling etc etc

MY REPLY

that's…surprisingly similar to what I've been discovering

again, semantic differences, but the concept is that the core functionality of the Church would be in a small environment, centered on a scant few traditions

mine seems to be more organization-focused, with the idea being that each group (i.e., housechurch) has its own freedom to individuate their style on MANY things, and scaling means breaking off new housechurches more than getting any larger building

HIS REPLY

The public gathering would be the coming together of the individual groups where visitors could get a "taste" of the corporate fellowship and subsequently could be invited to any of the individual home gatherings afterwards to experience a taste of communal life. Being politely excused before the communion table

And the visitors would have their choice in whatever home group environment setting that they felt most comfortable settling into which would help facilitate regular confession.

Each group with their own niche like you stated

And a loose doctrinal structure that ties them all together

### maintaining meaning - the spiritual man

Upon receiving the enablement of the Holy Spirit a believer grows
very sensitive to his spirit's senses. He should keep his inner man
continually free, allowing the Holy Spirit to flow out His life in and
through his being. To keep the inner man free is to maintain it in an
operative condition for the Holy Spirit. Suppose God, for instance,
sends a believer to lead a meeting. This one's spirit must be open. He
should not come to the meeting with a spirit loaded down with many
cares or weights, else this shall afflict the whole meeting with
heaviness, creating a difficult and unbearable situation. The one who
leads should not carry his burden to the meeting and expect the
congregation to set him free. Anyone who relies on the response of
the congregation to relieve him of his burden is doomed to failure.
When he enters the meeting place the leader's spirit must be light
and unbound. Many who attend are teeming with burdens. Hence the
leader first must release them through prayer, hymn, or truth before
he can deliver God's message. He cannot expect to unshackle others
while he is himself bound with unbroken fetters.

A spiritual Christian can no longer enjoy the anointing of the
Spirit in a work that has become mechanical. When a task is already
given up by God as unnecessary and yet is maintained by the
Christian because of the outside organization (with or without form)
which surrounds it, then it must be carried on by drawing upon his
own resources rather than upon the power of God. Should a saint
persist in laboring after the spiritual work is terminated, he must
employ his soul power as well as physical power to continue on with
it. In true spiritual service one must completely deny his natural
talent and gift; only in this way can he produce fruit for God. If not,
each effort not led by the Holy Spirit does collapse if not supported
by one's brain, talent, or gift.

A worker must observe carefully which part of his labor the Holy
Spirit anoints. Then he will be able to cooperate with Him and
operate within the current of His power. The worker's duty is to
discern the current of the Spirit and to follow it. A task should be
discontinued if it no longer enjoys God's anointing, is out of His
current, and creates a sluggish, languid feeling. Another undertaking
should be found which flows with the current. The spiritual man
discerns more quickly than others. The matter for him to determine
is, where is the Holy Spirit's current? Where is it flowing? Any labor
that oppresses spiritual life, that fails to express the life of the spirit,
or that hinders God's Spirit from overflowing has become a definite
obstacle, however well it began. That work should be either
cancelled or corrected so that the believer can obey life in the spirit.
The worker may have to alter his relationship to the work.
