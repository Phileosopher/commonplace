## 1 Running a Worship-Based Church

### fundraising

the best way to talk about general fundraising is to bring up what you were able to do with the prior money you've had
- this will jointly demonstrate competence while also showing that the money will be used wisely, as well as giving people the chance to share in the experience going forward

### the pastor's role

eph 4:11-12
 So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
the role of a pastor is to equip, and not necessarily anymore to be a "minister" as much as the actual Body

### 1 Statement of Faith

#### hermeneutics

whatever the philosophical framework entails, that determines the basis of the thoughts, which drives how the church runs

- even 1 misstated or understated specificity is enough to bring out the weirdness of strange doctrines
- this is all presuming that everyone is being honest and up-front, and some people are simply NOT intelligent enough to philosophically parse a well-drafted statement of faith

#### soteriology

Episcopal Church: "I was saved 2,000 years ago when Jesus was on the cross, I am being saved, and I hope to be saved."
- Salvation is simultaneously something that has already happened and is currently happening for them.
- It's probably the best way to look at it:
    - Caths focus on "will be"
    - Prots focus on "are" (with Calvinists on "was")

#### standard of practice - reddit comment

From my own [essay-writing](https://gainedin.site/groups-large) and research, I've realized that human interaction has a hard limit of generating meaning for the individuals in it of up to ~150 people. By that point, the only way it really scales is through the emergent order of subdivisions within that larger entity. This applies to all domains: management, distribution of services, city planning, etc.

In Christ, my expectation is that the growth should develop with a _hyper_-obsession with ensuring meaning is maintained with the members. This can be difficult (what with the [range of personalities](https://gainedin.site/personality/) we all possess), but is absolutely critical for the preservation of all souls involved.

I'm still writing it out and a few months out from getting to it, but my own informal abstractive mechanism involves the following solution:

1. Grow without provocation toward numbers, focusing on quality > quantity.
2. At approximately 50-70 people but never more than 100, force a divide (e.g., break a chunk of people off into a new church plant in the area, send off some people to another region, etc.).
3. As the other one grows, nurture it to a point, but leave it _very_ hands-off, including but not limited to permitting an entire denominational shift with that new church's culture. The only interaction should be on the basis of need or for collaborative actions (i.e., avoid centralized management).
4. With the exception of heresy, let whatever happens happen!

This is a complete abdication of power, and most pastors are inherently territorial, so I doubt it'll ever happen. But, that's the rough draft of what I'll be essaying on once I get a few other prerequisite essays finished in a few other domains.

#### statement of faith - things not believed

Statement of Things I Do Not Believe
Steve Blackwell (abridged & modified by Austin Stucky)

I am afraid that I am not convinced of the value of an "official" Statement of Faith, which can leave out as much as it puts in. While many ministries have carefully crafted statements of faith that comply with Biblical doctrine, in practice, many of them do NOT preach a sound gospel message of salvation. I have read more than one such statement, which sounded like it could have been penned by the archangel Michael himself. However, a closer inspection or listening of their words and life revealed much malarkey, none of which definitively contradicted their declaration, (Which should have ended with the words... "and then some").

Bearing this in mind I prefer to list what I DO NOT believe. Ignoring the finer points of English grammar, the words "I DO NOT BELIEVE" can be substituted with "THE BIBLE DOES NOT TEACH."

Please Note: That I, as a Christian, cannot belong to any man-made denomination, regularly attend any 21st Century Church, or subscribe to any man-made creed. (What is a Reformed Evangelical Anyway?). If you wish to hang a label on me, the word "Christian" will do very well. I owe everything I have and everything I am to Christ Jesus alone.

I DO NOT believe that all religions are valid paths to the same destination, or that Jesus was just a good man and a wise teacher. He was, and is, God Almighty whose return isn't far away.

I DO NOT believe that any man can adequately explain God's nature and being. Our understanding of God has been elevated to the place of untouchable orthodoxy. Scripture is content to make it clear that God (Yahweh) is God, Jesus is God, and The Holy Spirit is also God, without explaining how this is so, or what the exact relationship is between the Three.

I DO NOT believe that there is any logical or Biblical reason why a sovereign God, by His sovereign design, could not allow creatures made in His image the freedom of genuine moral choice, or that He is unable to keep that which He desires. 

I DO NOT believe that Christianity is simply a matter of reciting the sinner's prayer or that anyone who has once believed is saved regardless of what they do afterward. Salvation came to us at a great price and without holiness, no one will see heaven. Subordinating all worldly and personal ambitions to Him is the very essence of the Christian faith. 

I DO NOT believe that baptism is necessary for salvation. However, all believers must be baptized, it is an integral part of the Gospel and a command of Christ, yet some were not baptized. 

I DO NOT believe that speaking in tongues is (necessarily) the initial evidence of the infilling of the Holy Spirit or that everyone should speak in tongues.

I DO NOT believe in Inclusivism, Universalism, Ecumenism, or Interfaith-ism. 

I DO NOT believe that someone who does not persevere in the faith and does not continue to be obedient to the will of God will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Much as some would like to believe otherwise... if you fall away and live in sin... you will NOT be saved. However, it is not necessarily true that every believer who commits any sin will lose salvation every time he sins. 

I (am not convinced) that today's popular feel-good revivals are genuine. The test of true revival is that it changes the moral climate of a person or community. 

I DO NOT believe that children's Scriptural knowledge should be left up to Sunday School and Youth Groups, too many of whom are dedicated to having fun. "They are too young to understand such things" is the devil's argument to deter parents from discharging their duty. 

I DO NOT believe that women should not teach.* (However, women should not be pastors). 

I DO NOT believe in The Contemporary/Commercial Church which is light on doctrine and heavy on music and drama.*

I DO NOT believe in the Emerging Church, Seeker Sensitive Church, or the New Age Church which is, in many cases, doing little but re-merging with Catholicism and adopting practices learned from Buddhism and Hinduism. 

I DO NOT believe that Christians should be playing footsie with New Age beliefs (depending on how that term is defined), Yoga, walking Labyrinths, or indulging in mystical practices.*

I DO NOT believe that a Christian should have anything to do with Halloween, astrology, dowsing, Ouija boards, Reiki, Shamanism, people who claim to communicate with the dead, the likes of Harry Potter, or any other kind of psychic phenomena. 

I DO NOT believe in the New Ecumenism, nor should a Christian be a member of the Masonic Lodge.

I DO NOT believe that the sign gifts have been done away with, nor do I believe that every third person is a prophet. Furthermore, I do not believe in New Revelation* (technically), but that God has and does sometimes give special revelation/understanding to accomplish His purposes. 

I DO NOT believe that the Prayer of Jabez is a magic formula or that the so-called Bible codes are anything but random chance. 

I DO NOT believe that Homosexuality is just an alternative lifestyle and that Abortion and Divorce are simply matters of choice. (God abhors all three). 

I DO NOT believe that people should be playing God. Euthanasia, Cloning, and Stem cell research, among other things, should be strongly opposed by all Christians.

I DO NOT believe that anyone knows every single detail of end times events and certainly not the exact chronological order, we all know the outcome but for the present, there are plenty of life and death issues at hand. However, I do believe that the church had better prepare itself to go through the tribulation. 

I DO NOT believe that Christians should be involved in government or any of its processes* (in general) i.e., war, jury duty, judging and condemning, voting, pledging allegiance to a flag, etc., but should live peacefully within the bounds of the existing government God has set-up and submit to any of it wishes that do not oppose the wishes of their own King and Governor. 

I reserve the right to add to or take from the list above as I am led by the Holy Spirit and given more understanding. I am quite sure that many more things could be added, but this is a good start.

NOTE: THIS MAY BE GOOD FOR ME TO REPRODUCE FOR MYSELF AS A SEPARATE PAGE

#### theological discussion

the statements your church makes (theological, worship music) are VERY philosophical ideals
- any misstatement of any of them will almost certainly lead to [heresies] among the congregation

#### Creeds and Confessions

make a list of all the confessions and creeds
- compare/contrast

##### FROM NO AGENDA Social

Hey Adam,
I've just listening to the latest podcast and I wanted to give insight about evangelical Christianity. Lol first of all John was way off base. Evangelical Christianity is not connected to a denomination essentially any Christianity of any denomination can be an evangelical. Most churches even have a mix of evangelical and non evangelical Christians. However some denominations and some churches have a higher percentage of evangelicals. To determine if someone is an evangelical they need to ascribe to 4 principals.
First is that they had a conversion experience, which means they can point towards a specific time where they decided to die to the world and start living for Christ.
Second, they must believe in sola scriptura, which means that they believe that the Bible is the divinely inspired word of God, and the Bible is the sole authority not church leaders.
Third they must live with a Biblical world view in their daily life and evangelize to non-Christians.
Lastly, they must believe, that humans are inherently sinful, that Jesus' death on the cross was an atoning sacrifice that cleanses us from sin, and that his sacrifice is the only thing that can save us, not good works.
Thanks for all that you do,
Luke

---

creeds were originally designed as memorizable mnemonics that non-literate Christians could pass information onward with

Polycarp - taught by Paul
Ignatius - taught by John?
Clement of Rome - 4th bishop of Rome
bishops were appointed by apostles
- apostolic succession
- the bishops were a traditionally established maintainer of the faith, through the laying on of hands
- bishop means "overseer", and they were responsible to [manage] and curate the Church on doctrinal matters
- episcopas in Greek is not in Christian doctrine, and it was part of the administration of the Christian church
