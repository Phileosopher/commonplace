Ideal selling is 1 to 1
The marketing data is trying to create 1 to 1 in targeting
Machine learning can generate a 1 to 1 conversation

Like acting, sales works best when hidden.

People who sell advertising are called "account executives." People who sell customers work in "business development."

The most fundamental reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by it.

If you've invented something new but you haven't invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business - no matter how good the product.

Selling your company to the media is a necessary part of selling it to everyone else.

Advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to some remote place, I may see Wrigley gum alongside Glotz's gum. I don't know anything about Glotz's. So if one is $0.40 and one is $0.30, am I going to take something I don't know and put it in my mouth - which is a pretty personal place - all for a lousy dime?

If everybody's buying something, we think it's better. We don't like to be the one guy who's out of step.

A magazine about Motorcross (for example) is a total necessity to fans of that. Its profit margins would make you salivate. Narrowcast publishing. Occasionally, scaling down and intensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better.

If the buyer cares little about whose product or distribution services he uses, industry economics are certain to be unexciting, or even disastrous.

This works with candy bars: customers buy by brand name, not by asking for a "two-ounce candy bar". But it doesn't work with sugar: people don't ask for "a coffee with cream and C&H Sugar".

## how Google would do advertising

Marketers' ultimate goal should be to eliminate advertising by improving their products and relationships instead. (This is an unreachable Nirvana, but a good goal.)

Google - and Apple - make money by giving a key part of their business away for free, then making money on something else.

Too often, companies think that everything they do has value they must capture, charge for, monetize, preserve, restrict, and protect. Instead, the real value may come from the side.

Invest effort in social tools that enable customers to tell you what you should be producing. Hand over as much control to them as you can.

Advertising is supposed to tell us about a product or its price so we can save effort, time, and money in our search for it. Doesn't the internet itself replace advertising? Often, yes.

The fundamental message of marketing must change from "we want your money" to "we share your interests".

Companies should buy ads on relevant blogs, as a way to underwrite blogs, as they would a PBS show. Share the interests and affections of the blog's readers.

## selling

The person who knows how to get, keep, and cultivate a customer gets paid the most.

Everything starts with sales. Nothing matters until you sell something. Nothing. You can vision cast, dream board, but there is no business until a sale happens. A sale tells you if you even have a business.

I always have to laugh a little when someone says, "Oh, I'm not a salesperson." Then they launch into a ten-minute, detailed "sales" presentation - complete with bullet points and case studies - selling me on the fact that they're no good at selling.

Whereas before I had always thought of sales as a way to get something, I could now see it as a tool for giving.

Sales isn't about selling at all. Stop selling. Help instead.

The number one quality of the most effective sales and marketing messages? Empathy.

Your best sales and marketing language in those words - language that shows you know who they are, who they are trying to become, and what they are trying to do.

Bad dating: "He was a nice guy and certainly nice to look at… but he didn't ask a single question about me. He just kept talking."

Effective sales is about finding a perceived need and helping someone fulfill it. If the customer doesn't perceive the need, there is no need. The misguided drive to "create" a need is why we see so much chest-beating, egocentric marketing out there. It's obnoxious, exhausting, and what's worse, it's ineffective.

If you want to master one skill that will skyrocket your sales success, learn how to ask better questions.

Guy that sold a bunch of condos: "I sold a $4 million parking space, a $2.8 million gym and spa access pass, and a $6 million closet." He discovered what was most important to each client.

Instead of trying to sell candy bars one by one, sell them box-by-box. Parents' friends who had access to offices filled with candy lovers. These well-connected people emptied boxes of candy for him. Mark has never sold accounts one by one. Looked instead for influencers: people with their own large networks who, if sold on his idea, venture, or opportunity, could potentially generate entire volumes of transactions for him.

"I lose one out of five for being too aggressive." She paused for effect, then added, "But I get the other four!"

SUCCESS magazine had a record-breaking launch: over a million copies sold. With the help of eight believers. Just eight people who saw the vision and got on board.
