
Consider playing [games] with them to fix many of their issues:
- red light/green light is good for learning to listen and follow directions
- patty cake and clapping games for hand/eye coordination
- hokey pokey for foot/eye coordination and mapping body parts
LOOK FOR MORE

with siblings, reserve time as "solo play time" to give each of them an opportunity to play with their parents

Get godparents in case you die

A parent's possible job description:
- [cook]
- [creative] who makes things for children
- [manager]
- [teacher](pedagogy)
- [moral beacon]
- [logistician]

if a kid is having explosive tantrums, one possible solution is to stop talking
- don't give ANY feedback when they're blowing up, since they may be overwhelmed
- even comforting words or attempts to console may aggravate them further
- simply give them space
- if they're in public or don't calm down, indicate there will be consequences for their actions and leave it alone

kids don't need much with respect to school supplies
- most of that is [advertising] to foster a [consumer mindset](debt)

when a kid says they have to go to the bathroom, you have at most 2 minutes

REDDIT COMMENT
Lean into the bite.
I work in pediatrics and we‚Äôre re taught that if a child bites you, lean into it (push whatever part of you they‚Äôre biting further into their mouth) because their automatic reaction will be to open their mouth and the risk of them breaking your skin is greatly diminished.
Source: I was just bitten at work üôÑ
Edit: a word and grammar. Also, how the hell is my most upvoted comment about being bitten at work??? üòÇ
That works for cats too. If you pull away, the teeth dig in, but if you push into their mouth, they get confused and let go.
It‚Äôs a natural reaction that you will see in most mammals. The instinct is associated with the same instinct of gag reflex. However, you won‚Äôt see it with snakes or reptiles. (So don‚Äôt further jam your hand in the alligators mouth, you‚Äôll just lose more)
I do this to my brother's dog. She is a great dane/mastiff and loves to mouth on your arm when she wants attention and to play. I shove my arm further into her mouth and the dog's like, "no! Not like that!"

at the end of every day, ask your kids if you've done anything you need to apologize to them about

‚ÄúTarian y Gweithiwr‚Äù - 4 February 1897
THINGS THAT A BOY SHOULD LEARN
- to leave cigarettes alone
- to be kind to every animal
- to be humane and brave
- to be respectful of his parents
- to be tender toward his younger sisters
- to close doors without slamming them
- to gather the fire wood every night
- to sew a button and darn his sock. 
- to go about his chores directly and cheerfully
- to close the door in winter to keep out the chill
- to close the door in summer to keep out the flies
- to wash the dishes and make his bed when needed
- to clean his shoes instead of his sisters (cleaning them)
- to rise from bed without needing to be called a second time

Make it clear that actions are NOT okay when you screw up
- that behavior needs context

FROM JULES
Children need the following:
- approval from their same-gender parent
- acceptance from their opposite-gender parent
they also need the following:
- fathers must have good boundaries
- mothers must be nurturing
this creates a unique combination:
- boys need clearly-defined approval from their father
- girls need nurturing approval from their mother
- boys need nurturing acceptance from their mother
- girls need clearly-defined acceptance from their father

Kids need a few things
1 feel loved
2 feel protected
3 feel safe
4 matter

4 ways to meet that unmet need
1 get sick
2 be brilliant
3 be a carer for others
4 be the rebellious difficult one, usually when all the other roles are gone
