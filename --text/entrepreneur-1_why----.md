Definition of what makes a good entrepreneur by Paul Graham - relentlessly resourceful

Torchbearers often attract a crowd. People are fascinated by individuals who are willing to carry responsibility.
Torchbearers don't realize how unique they are, how powerful their role is, or how difficult their task is.
Torchbearers care more about forward motion than they do which route to take. Won't find them looking for perfect solutions in meetings.
Torchbearers don't stop until they finish. Balance between devotion to duty and the pursuit of joy. A torchbearer never forgets about or shortchanges a duty, even when that means postponing joy.

- Entrepreneurs _require_ the personality trait of conscientiousness to actually work the required craptons of work it takes to do.

Entrepreneurs MUST be a highly conscientious [personality] to do the work, introverted enough to plan and work hard alone, and disagreeable enough to edge out the competition
- Not-for-profit pioneers can be more agreeable, but have to be MORE conscientious to accomplish the same results (since the profit and cost activities are typically NOT AT ALL related)

One similarity among many entrepreneurs, she said, was an aversion to
prediction. "If you give entrepreneurs data that has to do with the
future, they just dismiss it."

Buffett downplays the importance of IQ in material success, stressing
instead the importance of character and drive.
Fair enough, but there are several different proven strategies for
turning those traits into billion-dollar fortunes. Not all of them
require exceptional intellectual capacity.
To the extent that Buffett's success has relied on discerning superior
values among stocks being scrutinized by millions of other investors, on
the other hand, brainpower has been an invaluable asset.
This is a fact worth considering as you try to match your own talents to
a specific strategy for reaching the billion-dollar circle.

Everyone is an entrepreneur. The only skills you need to be an
entrepreneur are the ability to fail, to have ideas, to sell those
ideas, to execute on them, and to be persistent so even as you fail you
learn and move onto the next adventure.
- BASICALLY, YOU'RE AN ENTREPRENEUR IF YOU TAKE A RISK, THOUGH IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE A CAREER PATHWAY

Build trust while you sleep. Honesty compounds over years and decades.
More people trust your word and spread the news that you are a person to
be sought out, sought after, given opportunity, given help, or given money.
- HIGH-CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

The essence of an entrepreneur is the die-hard belief that we are the only one able to make things happen.

## practical

In science, belief is literal belief; it is right or wrong, never metaphorical.
In real life, belief is an instrument to do things, not the end product.
This is similar to vision: the purpose of your eyes is to orient you in the best possible way, and get you out of trouble when needed, or help you find prey at a distance.
Your eyes are not sensors designed to capture the electromagnetic spectrum. Their job description is not to produce the most accurate scientific representation of reality; rather the most useful one for survival.

Survival comes first;
Truth, understanding, and science later.
There is no such thing as the "rationality" of a belief, there is rationality of action.
The rationality of an action can be judged only in terms of evolutionary considerations.
What is rational is that which allows for survival.

## rational enough

Base your decision on logic, not emotion. Many people let feelings and passion steer them toward a business, but don't let your heart call the shots. Starting a business is a logical decision. Stay focused on the important questions: Who are you? Where do you fit? Who are your competitors?Stick with the familiar. Choose something that feels comfortable. If it doesn't feel like a natural fit for your skills and personality, pick something else.Prioritize fun. If you don't enjoy your work, you won't succeed. Look for a business with the potential to be deeply satisfying.

## risk-taking tendencies

- you often can't know the kinds of trouble you'll be involved in beforehand
- many times, it becomes a battle of legality, and your [legal safety] only partly protects you
- this legal risk is an additional occupational burden on the modern entrepreneur, on top of the financial/career risks

In business, as in life, you can't afford to be afraid of doing the wrong thing.

Innovation is what you get when you capitalise on luck, when you get up from behind your desk and go and see where ideas and people lead you.

If you want swashbuckling action in your life, become an entrepreneur and give it a go.
Learn the art of trying to set up your own business.
Which is the same as saying, learn the art of making mistakes and learning lessons.

You could have 100% of the equity if you fully fund your own venture, but if it fails you'll have 100% of nothing. Owning just 0.01% of Google, by contrast, is incredibly valuable (more than $35 million now.)

My definition of a startup: a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

Entrepreneurs trapped in this system may prosper through general growth
in the economy, but they will not become fabulously wealthy. To pull out
of the pack, they must earn much higher profits than the economy as a
whole is generating. In short, if you hope to become a billionaire, you
must overcome the scourge of competition, one way or another.
- risk is ABSOLUTELY necessary, mostly because others are [terrified] of taking those risks, which leaves an [economic] gap of decreased supply

Proactive behavior is one common theme to watch for as you read the
following sketches of champion bargain hunters. Observe as well the two
distinct ways in which billionaires squeeze pennies until they scream.
Not only do they pay as little as possible for the assets they buy, but
they relentlessly strive to reduce the operating costs of their properties.

Buying when others appear to be panicking sometimes proves nothing
except that there was good reason to panic.

- learn what he didn't do right

Many entrepreneurs take a "just do it" attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to chaos more often than it does to success.

Entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline to harness the entrepreneurial opportunity.

Starting a business is often an act of desperation. Entrepreneurs are desperate for success and accomplishment. Desperation pushes us to take huge risks, leave comfort and security behind, and allow a business to consume our lives.

Decide whether you belong in the game.

I'm not a gambler. Professional poker players approach the game as a business. They recognize that gambling is bad for business.

to gamble is to rely on luck instead of facts. The professionals cash in by waiting for gamblers to come along.

wait until you have great cards before playing, so your odds of winning aremuch better than those of people who play every hand they are dealt. In business, this practice translates as being conservative. For instance, opening up a franchise might be a smarter move than starting a company from scratch.

It's far more dangerous to fly too low than too high, because it feels safe to fly low.

We shortchange not only ourselves but also those who might benefit from our work.

Figure out how to realign your comfort zone with today's new safety zone,

Commit to the frightening work of flying blind, of taking a stand, and of making something new, complex, and vital.

What's scarce is trust, connection, and surprise.

Better sorry than safe.

## self-confidence

Don't expect someone else to know what your skills and talents are
worth. If you let others determine your salary, it's a safe bet you're
being underpaid. You must take the initiative and ask for what you want.
If the price you ask is fair and reasonable and if there's genuine
social demand for the value you can provide, someone will surely pay you
for your efforts.

Entrepreneurs need to face their fears and be willing to fail, often in a public way. In fact, entrepreneurs who have a high profile, either because of personal fame or because they are operating as part of a famous brand, face an extreme version of this problem.

If I ever felt myself getting caught up in or brought down by what other people thought of me, whether or not they approved of what I was doing (or wearing), all I had to do is ask myself if they would be one of the ten people to cry at my funeral. Instantly their rejection would lose any power over my emotions.

Be AggressiveAggressive poker players win by scaring other players into making mistakes. In business, one way to succeed is to scare your competitors.

## skills - social skills

Many people network too much. It's tough to make money. It's not a party.

Every day think of at least two people to introduce to each other who
will help each other.

Pick your social media outlet, master it.

HOW TO GET RICH
- Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.
    - The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.
- business partners should have intelligence, purposefulness and integrity
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, public accountability, and leverage.
    - Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
    - The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.
- Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
    - Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
    - Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
    - An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
    - If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.
    - Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.
    - Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.

## styles of thinking

VENTURE CAPITALISTS STYLES OF THINKING:

"Art Critics"
assessed entrepreneurs almost at a glance, the way an art critic can
assess the quality of a painting - intuitively and based on long experience.

"Sponges"
took more time gathering information about their targets, soaking up
whatever they could from interviews, on-site visits, references, and the
like. Then they went with whatever their guts told them. As one such
investor told Smart, he did "due diligence by mucking around."

"Prosecutors"
interrogated entrepreneurs aggressively, testing them with challenging
questions about their knowledge and how they would handle random
hypothetical situations.

"Suitors"
focused more on wooing people than on evaluating them.

"Terminators"
saw the whole effort as doomed to failure and skipped the evaluation
part. They simply bought what they thought were the best ideas, fired
entrepreneurs they found to be incompetent, and hired replacements.

"Airline Captains."
took a methodical, checklist-driven approach to their task. Studying
past mistakes and lessons from others in the field, they built formal
checks into their process. They forced themselves to be disciplined and
not to skip steps, even when they found someone they "knew" intuitively
was a real prospect.

Smart next tracked the venture capitalists' success over time. There was
no question which style was most effective - and by now you should be
able to guess which one. It was the Airline Captain.
The Airline Captains had a median 80 percent return on the investments
studied, the others 35 percent or less.

Smart published his findings more than a decade ago. He has since gone
on to explain them in a best-selling business book on hiring called Who.

When young people who "want to help mankind" come to me asking, "What should I do? I want to reduce poverty, save the world," my suggestion is:
1) Never engage in virtue signaling
2) Never engage in rent-seeking
3) You must start a business.
Put yourself on the line, start a business. Yes, take risk, and if you get rich (which is optional), spend your money generously on others.

## unafraid of change

The route chosen by Perot and Walton, requires exceptional resistance to
the levelers. If you sincerely want to be superrich, you cannot let
yourself be deterred by the unavoidable fact that change upsets people.

What could be less complicated than purchasing an asset when nobody
wants it, then selling it when no one can live without it?

"If it's truly as simple as that, why isn't everybody rich?" The
standard answer offered by financial gurus is that most investors lose
their nerve when they see the crowd rushing toward the exit.

Thriving in the high-stakes environment he relishes requires a strong
stomach for fluctuations in fortune. In his first go-around with MGM
alone, Kerkorian came close to being wiped out on three separate occasions.

If (weaker people) got into the kind of situation Kirk got into they'd
blow their brains out or just fall to pieces. Kirk goes right back in
there and says, "Well, what can we do here? Let's start working on it."
