For any plan to work, every team needs at least one asshole who doesn't
give a shit if he or she gets fired or exiled or excommunicated.
For a group to make good decisions, they must allow dissent and convince
everyone they are free to speak their mind without risk of punishment.

[humor] can go a long way to defuse most conflicts

knowing how to [fix] things is a critical component for just about every manager

Pretend you are the complete opposite type from yourself on each axis.
What would the world look like to that kind of person? How would you
interact with that person?

In conversation : Indians are waiting for Westerners to interrupt them
in the customary places, and when Westerners don't - (because to
interrupt is rude in West) - the Indian assumes the Westerner has
nothing to say, and keeps on talking.
Because of the expected overlap, Indians tend never to put anything
important at the beginning of their remarks, because the other person
isn't listening. They begin with ritual comments and then, when the
other speaker has finished, and is paying attention, move on to the
substance of their message.

most of the work from a good project manager involves defusing the conflicts that teams get embroiled into
- it takes an [unbiased] view to accurately and articulately sort through the differences of opinion
- generally, it's often [political] as well, based on the varying [types of power] each person has

## delegation

To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem
is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It's better to hire three
smart subordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring
their solutions to the executive for a final decision. This specificity
is important because it tells us that if you're a high-level executive
at a major company, you probably don't need the advice in the pages that
follow. On the other hand, it also tells us that you cannot extrapolate
the approach of these executives to other jobs.

Before you ask anyone else to be involved, ask, "Do I really need this
person's time? Can I do it on my own?"
If you need the other person, define specifically what you need. Explain
why their involvement is important.
Give them everything they need to get up to speed. People don't mind
giving their time if they feel it's valued and helpful.
It's your reponsibility to have thought that through before you approach
them.

When you're confronted with complex, nonroutine problems, push the power
of decision making out to the periphery and away from the center. Give
people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise. All
you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility.

They had made the reliable management of complexity a routine. That
routine requires balancing a number of virtues: freedom and discipline,
craft and protocol, specialized ability and group collaboration. And for
checklists to help achieve that balance, they have to take two almost
opposing forms. They supply a set of checks to ensure the stupid but
critical stuff is not overlooked, and they supply another set of checks
to ensure people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while
nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances

4 categories of work:
- Business
- Internal
- Changes
- Unplanned work

Before you ask anyone else to be involved, ask, "Do I really need this person's time? Can I do it on my own?"
If you need the other person, define specifically what you need. Explain why their involvement is important.
Give them everything they need to get up to speed. People don't mind giving their time if they feel it's valued and helpful.
It's your reponsibility to have thought that through before you approach them.

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, ASK FOR IT
Don't beat around the bush. Don't assume people will know what you need. Don't make them guess.
The more specific you are about what you need, the faster you'll get it.
If asking an employee or peer, clearly frame your request and set a deadline.

Routine work can be outsourced or automated; artistic, empathic, nonroutine work generally cannot.

Someone outside your organization knows how to answer your specific question, solve your specific problem, or take advantage of your current opportunity better than you do. You need to find them, and find a way to work collaboratively and productively with them.

Whatever you are doing in your business right now, your goal really is to find a way to quit it. You need to stop doing almost everything you do at the office. Be a quitter.

Organize the talented. Connect the disconnected.

## WHAT TO DO : REQUIREMENTS, STATEMENTS

The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding what to build.

A requirement is a carefully written description of a criterion that the work is expected to satisfy.
Good requirements are easy to understand and hard to misinterpret.

Vision documents directly define the "what" of a project.
Specs define the "how" of a project.
Work breakdowns define the "how" of a project, from a team perspective.

Specs are complete when they provide a workable plan that engineering can use to fulfill requirements.

A vision document is where all of the perspectives, research, and strategy are synthesized together.
The simplest tool is the use of requirements.

A requirement is anything the team (and client) agrees will be satisfied when the project is completed.

Problem statements are 1-2 sentence descriptions of specific end-user issues, written in a format that identifies a problem or need from the customer perspective.
Problem statements are broader than bugs, because their goal is to capture what's missing from the customer perspective, instead of only what's broken from the technical perspective.
Problem statements should remain purely about customers and their needs.
Problem statements need to be converted into feature statements / scenarios.
Feature statement is a short description of something a customer will be able to do as a result of the project or tasks they will no longer have to do because the project automates those tasks for them.
Avoid any description of how these benefits will be achieved.
Feature statements should never describe a specific solution or design, but should instead explain the solution's impact on the customer.
Require a temporary ban on solution proposals during discussions of problem lists and scenarios.
Postpone discussion about design alternatives. Focus on clarifying the real goals of the project, ordered by importance.

Problem statements and scenarios are a simple way to define and communicate requirements. They are easily converted into design ideas without losing clarity about what's important and what isn't.

## drama and conflicts

some people are EXTREMELY high-maintenance individuals, often through no fault of their own
- high-neuroticism people get wound-up over all sorts of silly little things
- low-conscientiousness people will look for any excuse to get out of work
- some people simply don't know how to honor [social norms], especially if they're [neurodivergent]

## ethical use of ideas

Now let's talk about ideas and who owns what. If someone comes to see you with an idea you're already considering or working on, no matter how loose the connection, then stop them abruptly and tell them the situation. That's only fair. Ideas, by the way, can not be owned by anyone. You can not trademark or patent or copyright any idea. You can only protect the execution of an idea, and trademark the name. This is an important thing to know in any business, and is often misunderstood by people who come to you with an idea. Such people often request you sign an NDA, and I'm usually happy to do so.
- their [intellectual property] may give you some more money, but it could be their chance at becoming truly great (recollecting David w/ prophet Samuel story)

What if they come up with an idea which the company then develops then proves to be a huge success - who owns it? The company does. You do, if you are the owner of the company, and your employee put forth the idea.

If someone came to you with an idea. How far has she gone towards executing this idea? She should not have come to you without protecting that idea very very carefully indeed. However, if she brought out a sample which does not work well, but worked to some degree, the case is altered. She has executed her idea, however badly. If you wish to invest in the idea, you would almost certainly have to come to a legal agreement with the inventor.

## failures - firing

I think that you should only fire somebody as an act of last resort. If someone has broken a serious rule and damaged the brand, part company. Otherwise, stop and think.

## failures

## getting feedback

Test your own views in the form of questions. Let other people help you
smooth and polish your ideas. Use "what do you think of this
suggestion?" Don't be dogmatic.

The higher you go, the more your problems are behavioral.

It could be your expert intuition at work, or maybe it's just a
cognitive bias or other bug. You need to get some feedback: create a
prototype, run some unit tests, and chart some benchmarks. Do what you
need to do to prove that your idea is a good one, because your intuition
may have been wrong.

You need unit tests for yourself, too.

To help get a bigger picture perspective and test your understanding and
mental model, ask yourself something like the following questions:
How do you know?
Says who?
How specifically?
How does what I'm doing cause you to…?
Compared to what or whom?
Does it always happen?
Can you think of an exception?
What would happen if you did (or didn't)?
What stops you from…?
Is there anything you can actually measure?
Get hard numbers on?
Any statistics?

Indians don't admit when they don't understand, because saying they
don't understand would be like saying the person giving instruction did
a bad job.
So, when done, say, "What would you like me to explain again?"

BEST PRACTICES : MANAGEMENT STYLE:
- Encourage Indians to use their own judgement and make their own
    decisions in areas you have delegated to them. They do not always have
    to check with you before acting.
- Encourage Indians to approach your subordinates directly about matters
    you have authorized them to handle. Indians do not have to approach your
    subordinates through you.
- Encourage Indians to question instructions they think are inaccurate
    or wrong, and praise them when they do.
- Encourage Indians to speak up if they know a better way to do something.
- Explain to Indians that you regard them as your equals in the
    relationship, not just hired hands. That you are relying on them to act
    as expert consultants.
- Explain to Indians that you fully expect them to ask questions if they
    have not understood you.
- Instead of asking Indians if they have understood you, volunteer
    additional clarification and see if they accept it.
- Encourage your Indian subordinates to speak up at meetings whenever
    they have something to say.
- Try to praise the whole team, not just one individual.
- Don't be surprised when younger Indians can be very Western in their
    behavior one moment, and very Indian the next.

Coach her employees, "If you see people using our product in a way we
haven't anticipated, let's talk about it."

Seek constant, critical feedback. If you don't know how you're doing, you won't know what to improve. Focus ruthlessly on where you need help.
