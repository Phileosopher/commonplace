## promoting others' innovation

Customer tool kits and context orchestration: Forget about static, immovable products. If your customers are going to treat products as platforms anyway, then you may as well get ahead of the game. Make your products modular, reconfigurable, and editable. Set the context for customer innovation and collaboration. Provide venues. Build user-friendly customer tool kits. Supply the raw materials that customers need to add value to your product. Make it easy to remix and share.

Your real business is not creating finished products but innovating ecosystems.

Customers will expect to share in the ownership and fruits of their creations. If you make it profitable for customers to get involved, you will always be able to count on a dynamic and fertile ecosystem for growth and innovation.

Customers won't care whether their activities make you more money (that's your job) - they'll just want a superior product and experience, and perhaps even a cut of the revenue.

The best examples are the developer communities that have built up around eBay, Google, Amazon. External partners can build tools to leverage the database information, invent new kinds of stores or applications, and generally integrate their business processes. 40% of goods on eBay are now uploaded automatically from the inventory systems of 3rd-party stores that use eBay as an alternative sales channel.

Open up your platforms to increase the speed, scope, and success of innovation.

How do I make my organization a platform for participation?

How, when, and where do I open up my business?

How do I attract an energetic group of people to share the innovation load?

Om Malik blog post : "I wonder if this culture of participation was helping build businesses on our collective backs. If we tag, bookmark, or share and help del.icio.us or Technorati or Yahoo become better commerical entities, aren't we commoditizing our most valuable asset: time? We become the outsourced workforce, though it is still unclear what is the payoff. While we may gain something from the collective efforts, the odds are whatever the collective efforts are, they are going to boost the economic value of those entities. Will we share in the upside? Not likely!"

Most of the free electrons will gravitate towards the biggest centers of gravity. Companies with the most dynamic platforms - with great opportunities for partners to establish a synergistic business - will have the best chance of harnessing the enormous wealth of talent that all those free agents can offer.

The bigger the ecosystem, the better, because bigger ecosystems support more raw intelligence and more requisite variety. Becoming a pervasive and continually innovative presence means becoming a magnet for innovation that attracts lots of partners, suppliers, developers, customers, and other interested participants who are willing to build on your organization's platform.

We are shifting from closed and hierarchical workplaces with rigid employment relationships to increasingly self-organized, distributed, and collaborative human capital networks that draw knowledge and resources from inside and outside the firm.

Goldcorp story : couldn't find any more gold in their mines, though geologists said it was there somewhere, so as a last-ditch effort they put up all data since 1948 free online, and launched the "Goldcorp Challenge", paying $500k in prizes to participants with the best methods and estimates.

"You simply don't give away proprietary data. It's so fundamental that no one had ever challenged it."

If a small underperforming company in one of the world's oldest industries (Goldcorp) can achieve greatness by opening its doors to external input and innovation, what would happen if more organizations followed the same strategy?

Marketocracy: 70,000 traders to manage virtual stock portfolios in a competition to become the best investors. Marketocracy indexes the top 100 performers, and their trading strategies are emulated in a mutual fund that consistently outperforms the S&P 500.

Winning organizations will be those that tap the torrent of human knowledge and translate it into new and useful applications.

This utterly decentralized and amorphous force increasingly self-organizes to provide its own news, entertainment, and services.

Losers innovated internally. Winners innovated with their users. Losers jealously guarded their data and software interfaces. Winners shared them with everyone.

Couldn't just about any social or economic challenge be solved with a critical mass of self-organized contributors seeking an answer to the problem?

Wouldn't businesses be more productive if they could reach outside their walls to harness the insights and energies of a vast network of peers that converge around shared interests and goals?

If so, how would the traditional corporation change? What new business models could be built on this new collaborative approach to producing goods and services?

Jim Griffin on music biz : "Tarzan economics : we cling to the vine that holds us off the jungle floor, and we can't let go of the one we've got until we've got the next vine firmly in our hand."

Firms threatened by self-organizing prosumer communities face the innovator's dilemma.

The innovator taps a low-cost or no-cost volunteer production resource.

Move early to participate in building a brand-new business. By joining the community of new innovators, you might even position yourself at the front of the parade.

A new kind of business is emerging: one that
- opens its doors to the world
- co-innovates with everyone, especially customers
- shares resources that were previously closely guarded
- harnesses the power of mass collaboration
- behaves not as a multinational, but as a truly global firm

Make a comprehensive map of your innovation eco system that positions your value creation and aasses the interdependencies that will determine the flow of benefits and your ability to capture a share of them. This is not a traditional competitive analysis or value-chain analysis, but an analysis of the participants creating knowledge pertinent to your existing and future business. While this includes business partners and competitors, it extends to academia, public research institutes, think tanks, creative communities, or communities of practice, and contract research organizations. The map needs to be global and cover all relevant disciplines that intersect with your strategy.

You're taking down your borders and opening up for no tariffs, no tax competition. You need to know that your core assets and your skill sets allow you to continue to innovate fast enough as a corporation.

Openness does up the ante - it drives real value to the fore and forces every company to compete on a level playing field.
- IT ALSO GUARANTEES MORE [INFLUENCE] THAN KEEPING IT TO YOURSELF

Loose, voluntary communities of producers can self-organize to do just about anything:
- design goods or services
- create knowledge
- assemble physical things
- produce dynamic shared experiences
but don't overlook the fact that these communities operate according to well-defined norms, and have internal processes to guide the group's activities.

Debates remain on the public archive.

Sharing is about lowering costs, building community, accelerating discovery.

The growth of increasingly valuable online resources as a natural by-product of their use by self-regarding individuals. (No altrusitic sharing motives need be present, especially since sharing is the default in most online communities, including Flickr, Napster, and YouTube.)

If you ask 100 people to run a 100-meter race, the average time will not be better than the time of the fastest runners. It will be worse - a mediocre time. But ask 100 people to answer a question or solve a problem, and the average number will often be as least as good as the answer of the smartest member. With most things, the average is mediocrity. With decision making, it's often excellence.

(About product innovation or small companies:) What makes a system successful is its ability to generate lots of losers and then to recognize them as such and kill them off. Sometimes the messiest approach is the wisest.

Generating a diverse set of possible solutions isn't enough. The crowd also has to be able to distinguish the good solutions from the bad.

The simple fact of making a group diverse makes it better at problem solving.

Grouping only smart people together doesn't work that well, because the smart people tend to resemble each other in what they can do. The group knows less than it otherwise might. Adding in a few people who know less, but have different skills, actually improves the group's performance.

Encouraging people to make incorrect guesses actually made the group as a whole smarter.

In the 50 years since Vernon Smith did his first experiment in [wisdom of crowds] and published the results, they have been replicated thousands of times in ever more complex variations. But the essential conclusion of those early tests has not been challenged : that, under the right conditions, imperfect humans can produce near-perfect results.

To solve cooperation problems - like keeping the sidewalk free of snow, paying taxes, and curbing pollution - the members of a society need to do more. They need to adopt a broader definition of self-interest than the myopic one that maximizing profits in the short-term demands. And they need to trust those around them, because in the absense of trust the pursuit of myopic self-interest is the only strategy that makes sense.

Hawthorne Heights (Indie Band) - Each musician would spend four to five hours online everyday, engaging their fans in banter and generally making themselves accessible. The fans loved it! The fans couldn't believe they were actually getting a response, they had a fan for life because of that! By frequently updating their blog and swapping in new songs on their MySpace profile, Hawthorne Heights was able to give fans a reason to return.

Paid employees can be told what to do, online communities do what they want - Its often a price well worth paying.

Linda Parker ("Online communities editor", for the Cincinati Post) - "It used to read, 'Be a Citizen Journalist' and no one ever clicked on it, then we said, "Tell us your story" and still nothing. For some reason, 'Get Published' were the magic words."

Von Hippel (Head of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Group at MIT's Sloan School of Management) demonstrated that in fields as wide ranging as scientific instruments and mountain bikes and computer chips, the task of innovation was passing from the manufacturer to the user, who has both a greater need and a greater ability to improve a product's performance. Companies that embraced this change entered into a creative relationship with their customers, even going so far as to provide them with tools to help design the end products.

The ultimate success of one solution is not diminished by the number of unsuccessful solutions. As more people apply more diverse sets of problem solving methods, the odds that someone will crack the nut can't help but go up. And if they're wrong, you can just ignore them. But this truth only applies to crowdcasting projects like the Netflix Prize and InnoCentive. When we're using the crowd to predict the future, every response counts in the final tally. In these cases, the role of diversity is far more complex.

The best ideas result in enhanced status for their authors. Others naturally strive to meet or exceed the standard set by most talented of their peers, a tendency that effectively increases the overall quality of the work produced by the community. Much of the interaction between community members revolves around improving their skills. People like to learn and they like to teach. The community has an unerring ability to identify its most talented members and highlight their work.

Many designers think they can simply list their ideas on a website and it will somehow sell itself. Companies simply do not search these sites for ideas. But you can, and you know how to evaluate an idea. These designers are likely to be desperate for some help licensing their ideas. Try typing these keywords into your browser and then bookmark any sites that you like:
• "Invention for sale" or "inventions for sale"
• "Patent for sale" or "patents for sale"
• "Invention listing sites"

Visit inventor forums. Do an Internet search for "inventors forums" or "inventors discussion groups" to find forums where you can go check out what's on the minds and drawing boards of designers.

Mine the talent at art and design schools
- THIS CAN BE UNETHICAL, SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ASK PERMISSION FIRST!!!

Publicize constantly.

## researching

For new ideas, the spirit is willing, but the implementation is weak

the more research, the more prepared
- at the same time, you'll NEVER get it fully researched out right

rule of thumb: do the most risky thing in the safest possible way

The uniquely qualified minds to make new discoveries were outside the boundaries of his organization.

Harness the new collaboration or perish. Those who fail to grasp this will find themselves ever more isolated: cut off from networks sharing, adapting, and updating knowledge to create value.

How most businesses operate: When releasing a new product, a company
will spend months, sometimes years, fine-tuning, building up to one
critical moment: the launch. Then on launch day the product either is a
success or a failure. People buy it and the company makes a profit, or
they don't and the product fails.

Upworthy sent the same video with a handful of different headlines to
different subscribers. Upworthy wrote alternate versions of the winning
headline and sent it out to several other groups. It repeated the
process a ruthless 18 times, for a total of 75 variations in all.

DHH: "If I can put in 5 percent of the effort of somebody getting an A,
and I can get a C minus, that's amazing. It's certainly good enough,
right? [Then] I can take the other 95 percent of the time and invest it
in something I really care about."

An entrepreneur learns two things from failure: First he learns directly
how to overcome that particular failure. He's highly motivated to not
repeat the same mistakes. Second, he learns how to deal with the
psychology of failure.
- THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO FAIL FAST

(from God's Gold) Rockefeller's life was utterly free of accident because he calculated EVERYTHING pristinely
- In a way, the best way to be prepared is to steadily and obsessively overthink ALL possible things, then make the wisest decision after researching the heck out of something
- Also, acting slower in a season of endless churn is crucial: save money, prepare for an undeterrable strike at what you want

The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the thing customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible.

The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.

This specification will be rooted in feedback on what is working today rather than in anticipation of what might work tomorrow.

To study successful businesses you have to visit their stores, factories, offices - try their products, test their services, spend time at their websites. Most important you've got to talk with their customers, live with them, get to know their needs, wants, problems by spending time with them, seeing what they do, what works for them & what doesn't. What annoys them & what makes their lives easy or productive or fun. You'll learn more from 1 hour with a customer then 50 research studies.

No book, blog or conference could ever teach you more about your customers than you learn from watching them use your software.

I just went to Toys "R" Us and walked the aisles. I looked at what was on the shelves and tried to imagine ways to make a small change that would have a big impact.

My shopping excursions only planted the seed of an idea. I had to do more market research to germinate that idea: to figure out how to design it, how much it should cost, who might license it, and so on.

Discover hot markets and emerging trends. Check out websites such as Trendsetter.com and MindBranch.com

Look at new products, and ask store managers which items are hot.

There are usually three or four big companies that produce most of the products in a given market. Review their product pages or online catalogs. Go to their media page and read any new product releases.

Innovation through observation is observing how people use products at home, at work, or at play to identify their wants, needs, and desires.

Paul came up with ideas by looking at how kids play traditional childhood games and then updating them. One day he decided to take a look at a game kids have been playing forever: tag. "What can we do to update tag?" he asked himself and his team of engineers. "Is there any technology we can apply to tag?" Sure enough, they came up with Lazer Tag, using infrared technology.

I went into the Disney store at my local mall and asked the manager what their most popular product was. He said it was their cups. I saw that some of the plastic cups had a double-layer outer wall. The back layer was a color (red, blue, yellow, etc.), the front layer was clear plastic, and there were sparkles between the two layers. I immediately thought of other images and games you could put between the two layers of plastic, which kids could play by rotating the cup.

I looked on the bottom of the cups in the Disney store and saw the manufacturer's name, Trudeau. They licensed the idea from me, and for five years my rotating character cups were sold in every Disney store and theme park worldwide.

"What if a combination lock had letters, instead of numbers, so you could spell out your secret code?" He now has a successful product, Wordlock, which is sold in tens of thousands of stores around the world.

Many companies don't know how or don't have a system in place to go find those ideas. Likewise, many independent product developers don't know how to license their ideas, and some simply prefer hiring someone to "rep" their ideas to licensees for them. This scenario creates a huge opportunity for you to profit from connecting innovators with manufacturers. As a product scout, you find great ideas and then find the right companies to license them. In return for your services, the product designer splits the licensing royalty with you.

Become a licensing expert: a master at finding marketable ideas and getting them into the marketplace.

At inventRight we offer courses with CDs and workbooks as well as online classes and other tools for learning how to find, develop, and license great ideas.

Another great resource is Ideapow: an "online learning lab" for "entrepreneurial-minded people" who want to learn how to license ideas.

Far too many inventors and independent product developers overlook this step. They design with no knowledge of, and with no regard to, manufacturing.

## ideas that haven't been explored

We are going to need miracles. We call these miracles technology.

It allows us to do more with less, find value in unexpected places.

The future will be a time when the world looks different from today.

A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. A new company's most important strength is new thinking.

What a startup has to do: question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.

If something is "socially good," is it good for society, or merely seen as good by society? Whatever is good enough to receive applause from all audiences can only be conventional.

Doing something different is what's truly good for society.

## innovation

Startups use many kinds of innovation: novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, devising a new business model that unlocks value that was hidden, or simply bringing a product or service to a new location or a previously underserved set of customers.

Innovation is at the heart of the company's success.

## looking long-term

First mover advantage? It's much better to be the last mover. Make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years of monopoly profits.

Study the endgame before everything else.

Whether success comes from luck or skill: Is there a way to settle this debate objectively? Unfortunately not, because statistics doesn't work when the sample size is one.

Too many people are starting their own companies today. People who understand the power law will hesitate more than others when it comes to founding a new venture: they know how tremendously successful they could become by joining the very best company while it's growing fast.

Indefinite fears about the far future shouldn't stop us from making definite plans today.

I wanted to be involved in the meetings. I wanted everyone to see that I
was working very hard to create a return on the studio's investment.
- any art-based creativity-based career, such as writing or design or acting (or even programming), is essentially more a "business" than it really is an "art", because you're trying to render a service that people pay money for (even a book or a movie is a type of copy-pasted service)

Optimize for long-term value creation instead of short-term profit.
Bypass the low-hanging fruit and go after the big opportunities, the
ones that inspire and challenge you to grow.
