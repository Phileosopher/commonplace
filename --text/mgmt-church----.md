### 6 Denominational Distinctions

#### authority

One huge component of this domain is the aspect of WHERE authority comes from:
- We all agree it comes from God, but how it travels means everything.
- A.it could come from our compliance
- B. it could come from our granted position.
- it's ABSOLUTELY critical in the 10% event that the person is NOT behaving according to their position (e.g., the ignoble king, the unrighteous pope).
- Protestants and Americans lean into compliance, Catholics and Europeans lean into position

Even outside Christianity this holds weight. The sciences, for example, have many specializations, and each one has their own pedantic view about things that is technically correct, but only in their domain. Their specialization blinds them.

I'm convinced most denominations come from various niches we naturally form ourselves into. What he's saying is very true.

In these times, most people who discover this have 3 choices:
- 1. Make a new denomination, and "do it right" this time, adding 1 more of them to the pile.
- 2. Start a parachurch organization where they can do the most good.
- 3. Quietly work inside a denomination still because that's where they can best serve.

There's very little consensus on what makes the "right" culture, for several reasons:
1. That culture will honor things that may not be what the other people in that culture like. The other people will disagree over that minor thing as if it were a major thing (e.g., choice of music) and miss the unifying point entirely.
2. We only find meaning if we determine the qualifications of an ideal culture ourselves, and bestowing that specific meaning to others that we've found will make others question it at best and reject it at worst.
3. Even if we could convince everyone of conforming to a culture, we veer into the risk of creating a cult if there's no new information to continue churning around in the group that fosters change.

#### church versions

#### differentiation between denominations

Things Catholics hold and differentiate Catholics & Protestants:
- Papal infallibility
- Purgatory
- Petrine primacy
- Petrine universal jurisdictions
- FILIOQUE

The fact is that the precepts that guide the Church within Scripture are VERY culture-agnostic.
- this allows a LOT of interpretation about pretty much everything.

The cultural value of Protestants to insist on the surrounding culture to adopt their ways (e.g., "we live in a Christian nation") is a relic of the Catholic church's imposition from their political control of everything
- I'm no so sure about this now...

Break apart the components by denomination
- Soteriology
- Eschatology
- Homiletics
- Orthodoxy
- Heterodoxy
- Maybe call it a "religious jargon dictionary"

#### social hierarchy

The cultural power dynamics of a church group create a normative model that represents itself universally across almost any major church that respects a clergy/laity dichotomy:
- Level 0 - non-believers who may attend regularly
- Level 1 - claimed believers who don't identify with the church or only show up sporadically
- Level 2 - claimed believers who attend service regularly (i.e., 1+ meeting/week)
- Level 3 - claimed believers who have made a public declaration of their faith (i.e., membership or baptism)
    - Some churches (e.g., Calvary Chapel) don't use Level 3
- Level 4 - actively involved in publicly established lay-ministry semi-regularly (i.e., at least once every 1-3 months)
- Level 5 - actively involved in established lay-ministry very regularly or formally confirmed as a lay-minister (i.e., at least monthly)
- Level 6 - formally declared a mid-level or higher-order lay-minister or appointed as leader of a ministry
    - Most church leadership is Level 6 and higher
- Level 7 - formally declared an elder/church board member
- Level 8 - ordained as a pastor

Most evangelical churches lean heavy into Level 0 becoming Level 1 and Level 1 becoming Level 5.

Catholics tend to lean into making Level 2 into Level 5.

Nobody ever seems to work well with highly qualified outsiders (e.g., have the authority to become Level 6 from overseas missionary work in a different denomination).

#### spiritual gifts

Assuming they're still present, tongues and prophecy should be managed correctly:
- God made tongues for unbelievers and prophecy for believers ([1 Corinthians 14:22](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1co.14.22)).
- Tongues always had a recipient who understood it when they heard it ([Acts 2](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/act.2)).
- An entire church that speaks in tongues together instead of one by one is running a church incorrectly ([1 Corinthians 14:40](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1co.14.40)).
