Whether you're writing a report, a letter, or a presentation, ask yourself:
- Who's the audience?
- What are they looking for?
- How much detail do they want or need?
- How will the information I have help them in going forward?
- How much background information do they need?
- Is anyone likely to be hostile toward what I have to say?
- Are they familiar with industry jargons?
- What kinds of examples and analogies will be most helpful to them?

Which ad would catch your attention? "Loaded with fiber and vitamins" or "will lower your blood pressure, cholesterol level, and help prevent a stroke"?
Don't just tell people the benefits - show them how it will benefit their lives.
BAD: "This car has antilock brakes and passenger-side airbag." GOOD: "This car will save your life."
BAD: "We will prepare your taxes and send them to you, ready to sign." GOOD: "Our customer's tax refunds are 25% higher than the average."
BAD: "You will be working on a cross-departmental team." GOOD: "You'll be increasing your visibility in the company and working with people who can jump-start your career."
BAD: "This speaker specializes in leadership." GOOD: "The last guy who hired this speaker said, 'He made me look like a hero and inspired my people to raise our profits by 80%.'"

MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS THE MAP
As if you're driving to the same destination in different cars, if everyone has the map, you don't need to wait for the slowest one.
The it doesn't matter if you get separated, you all end up in the same destination.

GOOD ENOUGH
Don't let unhealthy perfectionism keep you from cutting to the chase. Know when to let things go.
Will anyone but me appreciate my efforts?
Can I significantly improve this if I keep working?
Does the possible gain in quality outweigh the lost time?

Use conventions so people don't have to think for even a millisecond.

Aim for self-evident first.
If that fails, self-explanatory should be 2nd best.
Try to not need to explain at all.

Omit needless words. Avoid happy-talk and instructions.

# Writing and Communication
* Always double check your texts via grammer checking tool before sending important communication. 
* Always double check the message you are answering to, before making conclusions or reacting in a hurry.
* Always double check the spelling of the name of whoever you discuss with before mentioning them so you don't offend them. 
* Always re-read everything you're about to send
* Don't misinterpret other's emotions and feelings based on your own mood 
* Stay factual don't jump to conclusions
* Double check your sources. Mention your references when quoting a number or text or reusing some idea / work / conclusion.
* Keep it simple.


You can't cut to the chase unless you know to whom you are talking.

Never post anything while angry
You can tell you're angry if you believe you MUST tell a complete stranger on a public forum something immediately
- you have no control of otherz' opinions, or the narrative

to write a book that people enjoy, aim for 178 pages
- that number seems to be the amount that makes people recreationally love a book


NOTE: WILL NEED TO SEPARATE OUT CHUNKS OF FICTION AND TECHNICAL WRITING ON AL WRITING TO NOTAGENIUS!
- make a NAG page on "how to write stories"
