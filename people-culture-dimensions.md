# The cultural dimensions

Each culture broadly classifies across multiple [measured](math.md) spectra, based on the [virtues](morality.md) they prefer to prioritize. There's no defined set of rules to demarcate a culture because there are *many* ways to [analyze](logic.md) how a people group can [decide](people-decisions.md).

Conflict style - confront the issues vs. coexist without conflict:

- Confrontational values directly addressing issues, which typically means [laws](people-rules.md) will change to reflect [trends](trends.md).
- Conflict Avoidance tries to coexist as much as possible, which often means long-standing [rules](people-rules.md) will stay uncontested.
- Confrontational requires [courage](mind-feelings-fear.md), but Conflict Avoidance requires patience and [creativity](mind-creativity.md).

Context level - directly state vs. heavily imply:

- Low Context values explicit and direct [communication](people-conversation.md), often in writing. Negative input is encouraged.
- High Context values implied, unstated [ideas](values.md), often in person and with fewer [words](language.md). Negative input is discouraged.
- Low Context requires clear-mindedness, but High Context requires consideration.

APPLICATION: A culture's [language](awareness.md) and [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md) creates implicit meaning based on their collective [emotional](mind-feelings.md) associations:

- Self-referencing words heavily define a nation's [identity](identity.md): "French" means "[idea](values.md)" to the French, "German" means "[order](understanding-certainty.md)" to the Germans, "America" means "[dream](imagination.md)" to Americans, "Mexico" means "[family](people-family.md)" to Mexicans.
- Europe
  - "Luxury" to the British translates as "detachment" because [sophistication](classes.md) implies rigidity and [emotional unavailability](mind-feelings.md).
  - "Money" becomes "unpleasant fact" in France because they see its scarcity as an impediment to their [purposes](purpose.md).
  - "Shopping" is, to the French, "[learning](understanding.md) your culture" because they consider the experience to be [educational](education.md).
  - "Luxury" to the French means "freedom" because it demonstrates the [image](people-image-why.md) of wealth.
  - "[Education](education.md)" in Germany means "social status" because they consider [understanding](understanding.md) to be highly important.
  - "America" in Europe creates multiple meanings: France sees it as "space travelers", Germany sees it as "John Wayne", England sees it as "unashamedly abundant".
- China
  - Chinese cook food in multiple locations in the home, and mealtime takes priority over [conversation](people-conversation.md), even at [business](business.md) dinners.
- India
  - Life for Indians is considered as a set of stages transitioning from [childhood](people-family.md) into [adult responsibilities](meaning.md), phasing into a self-reflective [philosophical](philosophy.md) stage, and terminating in a [retreat](legacy.md) from the world at large.
- Japan
  - "Perfection" translates to "purity" because the Japanese highly value [order](understanding-certainty.md).
  - "Food" translates to "perfection".
- USA
  - American culture is preoccupied with "[doers](results.md)" more than [thinkers](philosophy.md).
  - "[Love](people-love.md)" translates to "false expectation" because they [idolize](addiction.md) their [romantic relationships](gender.md).
  - "Seduction" translates to "manipulation" because they're *constantly* experiencing the quiet [influence](power-influence.md) of [marketing](marketing.md) and [bad systems](mgmt-badsystems.md) while also valuing their [freedoms](people-boundaries-why.md).
  - "[Dinner](cooking.md)" translates to "home" because it's where most of their [traditions](habits.md) take place after they [work](results.md), and the [food](cooking.md) is secondary. Naturally, "food" becomes "fuel".
  - "[Work](results.md)" translates to "[who you are](identity.md)" because Americans seek immense [meaning](meaning.md) in their [jobs](jobs-1_why.md). "Shopping", then, becomes "reconnecting with life" because it's a naturally social activity compared to work.
  - "Money" becomes "proof", since it's a measurable (and awful) way of keeping track of [wealth](economics.md) and [family-based social status](classes.md) means very little to Americans. This also means "luxury" becomes "credibility".
  - "[Quality](values-quality.md)" means "it [works](results.md)" because they're obsessed about [functionality](purpose.md) and convenience.
  - "Perfection" means "death" because American society *does* value [performance](results.md), but also values the [unknown](unknown.md).

Individualism/Collectivism - creating [the good life](goodlife.md) for oneself vs. the group:

- Individualism focuses on self-interested gain (and will often take more severe [risks](socialrisk.md)).
- Collectivism focuses on the best interests of the group (and often creates unique values that enforce harmony).
- Individualism requires [self-ownership](success-1_why.md), but Collectivism requires [love](people-love.md).

Masculinity/Femininity - [gender](gender.md)-irrespective focus on [results](results.md) or harmony:

- Masculine/Task-Based/Data-Oriented focuses on results, [information](understanding.md), and achievement.
- Feminine/Relationship-Based/[Dialogue](people-conversation.md)-Oriented focuses on harmony, context, and coexistence.
- Masculine requires [ambition](purpose.md), but Feminine requires [understanding](understanding.md).

Power Distance - how much [power](power.md) comes from [status](people-image-why.md):

- Low Power Distance/Consensual considers everyone as equal as possible. Group [decisions](people-decisions.md) involve everyone.
- High Power Distance/Top-Down rigidly honors a [social hierarchy](groups-large.md). Members aren't allowed to question leaders' [decisions](people-decisions.md).
- Low Power Distance requires [fair-mindedness](morality-justice.md), while High Power Distance requires [trust](trust.md).

Time Flexibility - how important deadlines are:

- Linear-Time emphasizes punctuality and fulfilling deadlines (and is often more [productive](results.md) with stronger [economies](economics.md)).
- Flexible-Time considers time management unimportant compared to other priorities (and often more minded toward [family](people-family.md), [relationships](people-friends-why.md), and the [unknown](unknown.md)).
- Linear-Time requires discipline, but Flexible-Time requires grace.

Time Orientation - how far into the past and future to [predict](imagination.md) things:

- Short-Term Orientation/Indulgence/Monochronic focuses on the present and near future.
- Long-Term Orientation/Restraint/Polychronic focuses on the far future and past (often with more [changes](people-changes.md)).
- Short-Term requires [awareness](awareness.md) of present [feelings](mind-feelings.md) and [impressions](people-image-why.md), but Long-Term requires [careful planning](success-3_goals.md) and restraint.

Thought Mode - consider things with principles or applications:

- Principles-First considers [philosophical ideas](philosophy.md) as the basis of [understanding](understanding.md).
- Applications-First considers proven [examples](results.md) and techniques as the basis of [understanding](understanding.md).
- Principles-First requires intelligence, but Applications-First requires [experience](understanding.md).

Uncertainty Avoidance - the value of finding [certainty](understanding-certainty.md) in things:

- Low Uncertainty Avoidance is fine with vagueness.
- High Uncertainty Avoidance will tenaciously [seek](purpose.md) answers.
- Low Uncertainty Avoidance requires patience, but High Uncertainty Avoidance requires perseverance.

Risk Tolerance - capacity to endure [social risks](socialrisk.md):

- Low Risk Tolerance calculates decisions based on [past events](hardship-ptsd.md).
- High Risk Tolerance calculates decisions based on [influence](influence.md) and [imagination](imagination.md).
- Low Risk Tolerance maintains [healthy traditions](habits.md), but High Risk Tolerance adopts [trends](trends.md) well.

Clearly, these are not exclusive dimensions. It's difficult to measure something based on a [group's](groups-small.md) [feelings](mind-feelings.md). However, there is a broad range called the [Overton window](politics-conservativeliberal.md) that clarifies the range everyone will accept [changes](people-changes.md).

APPLICATION: Each cultural value builds specific life skills:

- Confrontational people develop strong [conflict management skills](people-conflicts.md), and Conflict Avoidance people become skillful at avoiding and defusing conflicts.
- Low Context people keep things simple and High Context people learn to include kind language that hide ugly [realities](reality.md).
- Individualistic people become highly effective at calculating a [decision's](people-decisions.md) benefit for themselves, while Collectivist people can closely consider their effect on their [groups](groups-member.md).
- Masculine people learn [strength](power.md), while Feminine people learn [grace](morality.md).
- Low Power Distance people [understand](understanding.md) [justice](morality-justice.md), while High Power Distance people understand [loyalty](understanding-certainty.md).
- Linear-Time people are [productive](success-3_goals.md), while Flexible-Time people [win friends](people-friends.md).
- Indulgent people understand [happiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md), while Restrained people understand [sacrifice](purpose.md).
- Principles-First people [get more things done](results.md), but Applications-First people [understand things better](understanding.md).
- Low Uncertainty Avoidance people are [at peace](trust.md) with life, and High Uncertainty Avoidance people [understand](understanding.md) more.
- Low Risk Tolerance people maintain a [strong community](groups-small.md), and High Risk Tolerance people withstand [changes](people-changes.md) better.

APPLICATION: Cultural differences arise as distinct, obvious [conflicts](people-boundaries-why.md):

- Confrontational people find Conflict Avoidance people evasive. Conflict Avoidance people find Confrontational people rude.
- Low Context people find High Context people vague. High Context people find Low Context people destructive.
- Individualistic people find Collectivist people terrible at [decision-making](people-decisions.md), but Collectivist people find Individualistic people selfish.
- Masculine people find Feminine people [needlessly cautious](safety.md) and unproductive, but Feminine people find Masculine people needlessly reckless and [workaholics](success-4_routine.md).
- Low Power Distance people will find High Power Distance people rigidly over-trusting. High Power Distance people find Low Power Distance people rebellious.
- Linear-Time people find Flexible-Time people as lazy and distracted, but Flexible-Time people see Linear-Time people as obsessive and change-resistant.
- Indulgent people find Restrained people prudish and self-effacing, which Restrained people find Indulgent people reckless and self-effacing.
- Principles-First people find Applications-First people unimaginative, but Applications-First people find Principles-First people impractical and [uncaring](mind-feelings.md).
- Low Uncertainty Avoidance people find High Uncertainty Avoidance people obsessed with clarifying the unknowable, but High Uncertainty Avoidance people find Low Uncertainty Avoidance people comfortable with adverse [consequences](results.md).
- Low Risk Tolerance people believe High Risk Tolerance people are [creating chaos](unknown.md), but High Risk Tolerance people believe Low Risk Tolerance people hate [good changes](people-changes.md).
