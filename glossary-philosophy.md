# Philosophy glossary

Philosophy - A broad field of things concerning knowledge and where knowledge comes from, which gets meta because it questions its own methods. Has a wide variety of extremely useful sub-disciplines (e.g., [science](science.md), [logic](logic.md), [math](math.md)).

Broadly, the table of contents:

1. Metaphysics: reality, existence, being, big meta stuff
2. Epistemology: knowledge, knowing, understanding, values
3. Axiology: values which connect with [purpose](purpose.md)
4. Aesthetics: specific values regarding [beauty and art](people-image-why.md)
5. Ethics: Specific values about [right and wrong](morality.md)
6. Political Science: how everyone should [live together](jobs-specialization.md)
7. Philosophy's Culture: broad matters of how philosophers [approach their craft](philosophy.md)

[Religion](religion-answers.md) tends to dovetail closely with philosophy.

## Metaphysics

Metaphysics/Ontology - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of [reality](reality.md).

### How many parts is reality made of?

Dualism - Things have fundamentally different natures, usually between mental and physical.

- Cartesianism/Substance dualism - The mind is a metaphysical non-physical thing, totally separate from the body. Opposite of physicalism.
- Epiphenomenalism - Physical events cause mental effects, but mental events don't cause physical effects.
- Mentalism - Though they interact with one another, the mind and brain are different things.
- Realism - Reality doesn't require perception to be real, and things have attributes no matter what anyone thinks. Opposite of acosmism.
  - Naïve/Direct/Perceptual/Common-sense realism - The senses provide us with direct awareness of objects as they really are. Opposite of sensualism.

Monism - There is only one principle, essence, substance or energy.

- Dynamism - Forces and interactions are essential parts of matter.
- Idealism - A broad view that reality or knowledge is founded on mental experiences (ideas). Depending on those ideals, it may be the same as materialism or realism.
  - German idealism - The things we perceive in objects are part of our perceptions, not in the thing itself.
  - Objective idealism - In an important way, there's only 1 perceiver, which contains everything that the perceiver observes.
  - Subjective idealism - Only minds and things in the mind exist.
- Materialism - The only thing that exists is matter, and all "non-material" things are just material interactions.
  - Christian materialism - The only thing that "exists" are the material things, which are an extension of Jesus.
  - Dialectical materialism - Ideas and arguments can only exist as matter, so the subconscious state of humanity doesn't exist.
  - Historical materialism - People exist because their [social group](groups-member.md) defines them, not because they are conscious in their mind.
  - Naturalism/Metaphysical naturalism - Values, souls, and anything else "supernatural" is merely part of the natural.
  - Physicalism - Everything is physical, and thus scientifically knowable.
    - Eliminative materialism - Some of the weird things people believe in don't exist.
    - Emergent materialism - The mind is certainly unique from everything else, but studying mental events should be separate from the other [sciences](science.md).
    - French materialism - Associationism (see below) can coexist with emanationism (see below).
    - Reductive materialism/Type physicalism/Type identity theory/Mind-brain identity theory/Identity theory of mind - Some of the weird things people believe in do exist, but not the way they think it does.
    - Revisionary materialism - Some of the weird things people believe in do exist, but probably not the way they think it does.

Pluralism - There are many kinds of things in reality that can't be lumped together.

- Holism - The whole of something is more than just all its parts combined. Opposite of reductionism.
- Organicism - Reality can best be defined as an organic whole. Close to holism.
- Reductionism - Things can be completely broken down into their components and assembled together again with no change in their value. Opposite of holism.
  - Ontological reductionism - Everything that exists is made of smaller, consistent things. Contrasts to monism.

### Does reality exist?

Absolutism - Facts are absolute, not relative. Opposite of relativism.

- Necessitarianism - Everything either is or isn't, so there's no such thing as possibility.

Accidentalism - Cause-and-effect is merely an illusion.

Conceptualism - Universals exist only within the mind, but not in external reality. Middle ground between nominalism and realism.

Eternalism - Everything has existed for all of eternity.

Illusionism - Everything is just a collection of illusions made by human consciousness.

- Acosmism - The entire universe is a complete illusion. Opposite of realism.

Nominalism - Universals and mental concepts have no objective reality, but are merely words or names.

Philosophical presentism - Neither the future nor the past exists, as they are only in our [memories](understanding.md) and [imagination](imagination.md). Opposite of eternalism.

Relativism - Facts have no absolute, so everything is relative to context. Opposite of absolutism.

### What is reality made of?

Anti-realism - We can't know about some things, or they don't exist.

- Modal realism - [Imaginary](imagination.md) things are as possible as real things.

Atomism - Everything in the universe is made of small elements.

- Buddhist atomism - The universe is made of small, momentary atoms that flash in and out of existence.
- Greek atomism - The universe is made of small, indestructible elements that last eternally.

Constructivism - Reality, or our knowledge of it, is a subjective framework filled with values instead of us passively taking in objective things.

Determinism - Absolutely everything is caused by an unbroken chain of previous events. Opposite of indeterminism.

- Biologism/genetic determinism/biological determinism - Our genetics or environment determine *everything* about people.
- Finalism/Teleology - Any event is already defined by the end result, so all events are shaped retroactively by it.
- Hereditarianism - People inherit mental elements like personality and intelligence from their parents.
- Historical determinism - Every event in time is directly caused by other events before it, so those events can predict what will happen.
- Historicism - Every event in time is directly caused by other events before it, so everything can be explained by principles.

Emanationism - Reality must come out from a first principle/God.

- Occasionalism - Created things can't be efficient causes of events, since they were created, so it must come from God.
- Ontologism/Onto-theology - God and Divine ideas are the first part of our intelligence, so knowing God is our first act of knowing.

Essentialism - Each and every thing has a theoretically finite list of attributes that are necessary for it to exist, and that thing must abide by that list to stay as that thing.

Hylozoism - All matter is alive, or at least some physical things have life.

- Vitalism - Life can't be explained solely by physical causes. Opposite of mechanism.
- Panpsychism - All parts of matter involve mind, or the whole universe has a mind.

Immaterialism - All reality is the structure of a flawed perception, and there are no material objects.

Indeterminism - At least some events have no cause. Opposite of determinism.

Intrinsicism - Values are completely separate things from objects, and can still exist even if the physical thing doesn't.

- Platonism (metaphysics)/Platonic realism/Form theory - There are abstract universals/forms in a special perfect realm, and everything is generally imitating them.

Optimism - This reality is the best of all possible realities. Opposite of pessimism.

Pessimism - This reality is the worst of all possible realities. Opposite of optimism.

Physicalism - Everything has a physical part to it.

- Mechanism - Everything can be explained by physical causes. Opposite of vitalism.

Voluntarism - The will has the most impact on everything.

### Who runs reality?

Animism - A broad, vague idea that non-physical forces control everything.

Nontheism - A broad belief set that says a deity doesn't exist or is unknowable. A subset of anti-realism.

- Agnosticism - We can't know about a deity's existence.
  - Agnostic theism - We don't know if a deity exists and it's probably unknowable, but still worth believing in.
  - Weak/implicit/empirical/negative agnosticism - We don't know if deities exist, but it's not necessarily unknowable.
  - Strong/explicit/positive agnosticism - It's impossible for people to know whether deities exist.
- Atheism - There is no deity.
  - Methodological naturalism - Every other possible explanation should apply before saying a deity caused something.
  - Weak/implicit/negative atheism - There's no evidence of a deity.
  - Strong/explicit/positive/hard/gnostic atheism - Deities in no way exist.
- Agnostic atheism - We don't know if a deity exists and it's probably unknowable, it's unimportant, or claiming non-knowing is the best way to live.
- Darwinism - All life came from the same living ancestor through small changes over a long time.
- Ignosticism/Igtheism - Questioning the existence of God is meaningless because the word "God" is vaguely defined.
  - Theological noncognitivism - Religious language like "God" have no meaning, and can't be proved without connections to other things, so they don't exist.

Theism - A deity or deities exist, and may be involved in maintaining/creating the universe.

- Creationism - Everything was made by a deity, either from nothing or by making order from chaos.
  - Evolutionary creationism/Theistic evolution - Modern [scientific](science.md) beliefs are compatible with Christian religious teachings about God.
    - Day-age/Old Earth creationism - Every "day" in the Bible's Genesis account was a long evolutionary era.
    - Gap creationism/Restitution creationism/Ruin-Reconstruction - There's a big gap in between Day 1 and the other days in the Bible's creation story.
  - Young Earth creationism - God made everything sometime between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago.
  - Omphalos creationism - Since God could have made everything at any age he wanted, any [scientific](science.md) study about the history of the universe is irrelevant.
- Monotheism - A single, universal, all-encompassing deity made the universe.
  - Augustinianism - People are subject to hereditary sin and God's condemnation, and Jesus (who had no sin) was certainly a physical man, so physical things are sometimes good. Opposite of Platonism.
  - Classical theism - God is an absolute, eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful, perfect being, and caused the [universe](reality.md) and [morality](morality.md), but is unaffected by the world and its time-based things.
  - Deism - One God exists, but is uninvolved with this world's actions, so miracles don't exist.
  - Monistic theism - A broad idea that God is a universal being, the universe is part of God, or God is part of the universe.
  - Pantheism/Cosmotheism - Everything is part of an all-encompassing God, or God and the universe are the same thing.
  - Panentheism - God is part of the universe, but also the force behind the universe and the cause of [morality](morality.md).
  - Pandeism - Everything is part of an all-encompassing God, or God and the universe are the same thing, but this God is uninvolved in this world's actions.
  - Substance monotheism - God is different persons/deities, but all of the same essence.

    - Kathenotheism - While there are multiple deities, only one is worth worshiping at a time.
  - Monolatrism - While there are multiple deities, only one specific one is worth worshiping.
- Substantialism - Aware entities make unexplained events happen.

## Epistomology

Epistemology - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and scope of [knowledge](understanding.md).

### What is knowledge?

Behaviorism - Presuming materialism (see above), the mind isn't significant to anything else, so it can be researched [scientifically](science.md) without considering inner mental states.

- Logical/analytical behaviorism - Mental concepts can be explained as behavioral concepts.
  - Computationalism - thoughts are merely calculated, computed things without any additional elements to them
- Methodological behaviorism - Psychological data must be outwardly measurable, so only what people do can be measured or controlled.
  - Psychological behaviorism - People learn by things beyond normal animal understanding, since we have a remarkable learning ability.
  - Radical/Skinner behaviorism - Human behaviors are learned, so even people's thoughts can be measured or controlled.
  - Post-Skinnerism/Teleological behaviorism - Human behaviors are learned, so [large groups](groups-large.md) can be measured (close to [macroeconomics](economics.md)).

Conventionalism - Some fundamental [universals of existence](humanity-universals.md) are grounded on agreements in society, not strictly on [reality](reality.md).

Dialetheism - Some statements can be both true and false at the same exact time.

Empiricism/Experimentalism - All knowledge comes from experiences, so there's no innate understanding about the world. Opposite of rationalism.

- Associationism - Mental processes are connected to other mental processes.
- Verificationism - We tend to verify what we experience, so what we've verified is effectively truth.

Externalism - The conscious mind isn't only what's going inside, but also things happening outside it. Opposite of internalism.

Externism - Only outside experience is certain, and there's nothing certain inside the mind. Opposite of solipsism.

Ethnocentrism - People view their environment through their [culture](people-culture.md).

- Methodological relativism - A researcher must suspend their [cultural biases](people-culture.md) to understand other [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md) and [behaviors](results.md).
- Polylogism - People think differently because of the [groups](groups-small.md) they're in.

Innatism - The mind is born with ideas or knowledge, so not all of it comes from experiences. Contrasts against empiricism.

Internalism - Actions are always caused by desires and beliefs, never facts about the world. Opposite of externalism.

Linguistic determinism - Our [language](language.md) determines how we understand things.

- Descriptivism - The meanings of names are the descriptions that the speakers give, and the things they point to are just the objects that satisfy those descriptions.
- Linguistic relativism - Since everyone thinks differently from different languages, they have different ideas for the same things.

Logical atomism - There are pieces of thought that can't be divided into smaller pieces of thought.

Phenomenalism - Physical objects aren't things themselves, and are simply bundles of sensory data.

Positivism - The only true knowledge is [scientific](science.md) knowledge from sensory information.

Presuppositionalism - assuming God exists, understanding comes through revelation and not through logic.

Rationalism - Reasoning can be the source of all knowledge. Opposite of empiricism.

Sensualism - Senses and perception are the most basic and important parts of understanding.

Solipsism - Only direct mental experience is certain, and there's nothing certain outside the mind. Opposite of externism.

- Transcendental idealism - Presuming idealism (see above), human experiences aren't things as they are, but are simply the things inside the mind.
- Hegelianism - Everything can be broken up into rational categories. Transcendental idealism mixed with reductionism (see above).

### How much can we know?

Critical realism - Some information we perceive represents reality outside our mind, while other information doesn't.

Deconstructionism - Everything is too impossibly complicated or unstable to determine.

- Existentialism - Deep down, all existence is a bunch of "themes" (e.g., love, freedom, etc.) that we can't further clarify or understand.
  - Christian existentialism - While we can't clarify or understand our themes, the God of the Bible can help us with them.
  - Christian existential humanism - People can make free will choices through Jesus' teachings.
- Interpretivism - Knowledge is strictly a matter of interpretation.
- Perspectivism - Since our perceptions, experience, and thoughts are relative to experience, nothing we perceive is true.

Disjunctivism - Assuming Naïve/Direct/Perceptual/Common-sense realism, our senses are wrong about some things.

Fallibilism - Absolute certainty about anything we know is impossible except logically consistent things of the mind, like [math](math.md) and [logic](logic.md).

Infinitism - Knowledge can be confirmed by an infinite chain of reasons behind it.

Intuitionism/Neointuitionism - Math is a merely a mental construct of the mind that allows people to make more elaborate calculations than anything in nature. Opposite of preintuitionism.

- Logicism - [Math](math.md) is merely an extension of [logic](logic.md), so all math can distill to logical statements ([has theoretically been proven by computers](logic.md)).

Operationalism/Operationalization - We can define values through specific observations.

Preintuitionism - Math exists in the world around us, so understanding math is to increase understanding of existing things. Opposite of intuitionism.

Relationalism - Things can only be defined in relationship to other things. Opposite of substantivalist.

Reliablism - A belief is only knowledge if it came through a reliable method.

Representationalism - People can't perceive the world directly, and instead only see their ideas or interpretations of the world.

Substantivalism - Things like space and time are entities in their own right, independent of anything else or how they're defined. Opposite of relationalism.

Tautology - A statement that's universally true.
