# Philosophy glossary

Philosophy - A broad field of things concerning knowledge and where knowledge comes from, which gets meta because it questions its own methods. Has a wide variety of extremely useful sub-disciplines (e.g., [science](science.md), [logic](logic.md), [math](math.md)).

Broadly, the table of contents:

1. Metaphysics: reality, existence, being, big meta stuff
2. Epistemology: knowledge, knowing, understanding, values
3. Axiology: values which connect with [purpose](purpose.md)
4. Aesthetics: specific values regarding [beauty and art](image.md)
5. Ethics: Specific values about [right and wrong](morality.md)
6. Political Science: how everyone should [live together](jobs-specialization.md)
7. Philosophy's Culture: broad matters of how philosophers [approach their craft](philosophy.md)

[Religion](religion-answers.md) tends to dovetail closely with philosophy.

## Metaphysics

Metaphysics/Ontology - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of [reality](reality.md).

### How many parts is reality made of?

Dualism - Things have fundamentally different natures, usually between mental and physical.

- Cartesianism/Substance dualism - The mind is a metaphysical non-physical thing, totally separate from the body. Opposite of physicalism.
- Epiphenomenalism - Physical events cause mental effects, but mental events don't cause physical effects.
- Mentalism - Though they interact with one another, the mind and brain are different things.
- Realism - Reality doesn't require perception to be real, and things have attributes no matter what anyone thinks. Opposite of acosmism.
  - Na√Øve/Direct/Perceptual/Common-sense realism - The senses provide us with direct awareness of objects as they really are. Opposite of sensualism.

Monism - There is only one principle, essence, substance or energy.

- Dynamism - Forces and interactions are essential parts of matter.
- Idealism - A broad view that reality or knowledge is founded on mental experiences (ideas). Depending on those ideals, it may be the same as materialism or realism.
  - German idealism - The things we perceive in objects are part of our perceptions, not in the thing itself.
  - Objective idealism - In an important way, there's only 1 perceiver, which contains everything that the perceiver observes.
  - Subjective idealism - Only minds and things in the mind exist.
- Materialism - The only thing that exists is matter, and all "non-material" things are just material interactions.
  - Christian materialism - The only thing that "exists" are the material things, which are an extension of Jesus.
  - Dialectical materialism - Ideas and arguments can only exist as matter, so the subconscious state of humanity doesn't exist.
  - Historical materialism - People exist because their [social group](groups-member.md) defines them, not because they are conscious in their mind.
  - Naturalism/Metaphysical naturalism - Values, souls, and anything else "supernatural" is merely part of the natural.
  - Physicalism - Everything is physical, and thus scientifically knowable.
    - Eliminative materialism - Some of the weird things people believe in don't exist.
    - Emergent materialism - The mind is certainly unique from everything else, but studying mental events should be separate from the other [sciences](science.md).
    - French materialism - Associationism (see below) can coexist with emanationism (see below).
    - Reductive materialism/Type physicalism/Type identity theory/Mind-brain identity theory/Identity theory of mind - Some of the weird things people believe in do exist, but not the way they think it does.
    - Revisionary materialism - Some of the weird things people believe in do exist, but probably not the way they think it does.

Pluralism - There are many kinds of things in reality that can't be lumped together.

- Holism - The whole of something is more than just all its parts combined. Opposite of reductionism.
- Organicism - Reality can best be defined as an organic whole. Close to holism.
- Reductionism - Things can be completely broken down into their components and assembled together again with no change in their value. Opposite of holism.

### Does reality exist?

Absolutism - Facts are absolute, not relative. Opposite of relativism.

- Necessitarianism - Everything either is or isn't, so there's no such thing as possibility.

- Occasionalism - Created things can't be efficient causes of events, since they were created, so it must come from God.
- Ontologism/Onto-theology - God and Divine ideas are the first part of our intelligence, so knowing God is our first act of knowing.

## Epistomology

Epistemology - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and scope of [knowledge](understanding.md).

### What is knowledge?

Behaviorism - Presuming materialism (see above), the mind isn't significant to anything else, so it can be researched [scientifically](science.md) without considering inner mental states.

- Logical/analytical behaviorism - Mental concepts can be explained as behavioral concepts.
  - Computationalism - thoughts are merely calculated, computed things without any additional elements to them
- Methodological behaviorism - Psychological data must be outwardly measurable, so only what people do can be measured or controlled.
  - Psychological behaviorism - People learn by things beyond normal animal understanding, since we have a remarkable learning ability.
  - Radical/Skinner behaviorism - Human behaviors are learned, so even people's thoughts can be measured or controlled.
  - Post-Skinnerism/Teleological behaviorism - Human behaviors are learned, so [large groups](groups-large.md) can be measured (close to [macroeconomics](economics.md)).

Conventionalism - Some fundamental [universals of existence](humanity-universals.md) are grounded on agreements in society, not strictly on [reality](reality.md).

Dialetheism - Some statements can be both true and false at the same exact time.

- Associationism - Mental processes are connected to other mental processes.
- Verificationism - We tend to verify what we experience, so what we've verified is effectively truth.

Externalism - The conscious mind isn't only what's going inside, but also things happening outside it. Opposite of internalism.

Externism - Only outside experience is certain, and there's nothing certain inside the mind. Opposite of solipsism.

Ethnocentrism - People view their environment through their [culture](culture.md).

- Methodological relativism - A researcher must suspend their [cultural biases](culture.md) to understand other [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md) and [behaviors](mind-creativity-results.md).
- Polylogism - People think differently because of the [groups](groups-small.md) they're in.

Innatism - The mind is born with ideas or knowledge, so not all of it comes from experiences. Contrasts against empiricism.

Internalism - Actions are always caused by desires and beliefs, never facts about the world. Opposite of externalism.

Linguistic determinism - Our [language](language.md) determines how we understand things.

- Descriptivism - The meanings of names are the descriptions that the speakers give, and the things they point to are just the objects that satisfy those descriptions.
- Linguistic relativism - Since everyone thinks differently from different languages, they have different ideas for the same things.

Logical atomism - There are pieces of thought that can't be divided into smaller pieces of thought.

Phenomenalism - Physical objects aren't things themselves, and are simply bundles of sensory data.

Positivism - The only true knowledge is [scientific](science.md) knowledge from sensory information.

Presuppositionalism - assuming God exists, understanding comes through revelation and not through logic.

Rationalism - Reasoning can be the source of all knowledge. Opposite of empiricism.

- Hegelianism - Everything can be broken up into rational categories. Transcendental idealism mixed with reductionism (see above).

### How much can we know?

Critical realism - Some information we perceive represents reality outside our mind, while other information doesn't.

Deconstructionism - Everything is too impossibly complicated or unstable to determine.

- Existentialism - Deep down, all existence is a bunch of "themes" (e.g., love, freedom, etc.) that we can't further clarify or understand.
  - Christian existentialism - While we can't clarify or understand our themes, the God of the Bible can help us with them.
  - Christian existential humanism - People can make free will choices through Jesus' teachings.
- Interpretivism - Knowledge is strictly a matter of interpretation.
- Perspectivism - Since our perceptions, experience, and thoughts are relative to experience, nothing we perceive is true.

Disjunctivism - Assuming Na√Øve/Direct/Perceptual/Common-sense realism, our senses are wrong about some things.

Fallibilism - Absolute certainty about anything we know is impossible except logically consistent things of the mind, like [math](math.md) and [logic](logic.md).

Infinitism - Knowledge can be confirmed by an infinite chain of reasons behind it.

Intuitionism/Neointuitionism - Math is a merely a mental construct of the mind that allows people to make more elaborate calculations than anything in nature. Opposite of preintuitionism.

- Logicism - [Math](math.md) is merely an extension of [logic](logic.md), so all math can distill to logical statements ([has theoretically been proven by computers](logic.md)).

Operationalism/Operationalization - We can define values through specific observations.

Preintuitionism - Math exists in the world around us, so understanding math is to increase understanding of existing things. Opposite of intuitionism.

Relationalism - Things can only be defined in relationship to other things. Opposite of substantivalist.

Reliablism - A belief is only knowledge if it came through a reliable method.

Representationalism - People can't perceive the world directly, and instead only see their ideas or interpretations of the world.

Tautology - A statement that's universally true.

## Axiology

Axiology - The branch of philosophy concerned with the concept of "[value](symbols.md)".

### How do we find purpose?

Absurdism - [Reality](reality.md) doesn't give us meaning, so we must accept that fact to find [purpose](purpose.md).

Nihilism - Absolutely everything has zero meaning, purpose, knowable truth, or value.

- Fatalism - Because determinism (see above) is true, thinking and doing anything is pointless to determine events.

Anthropomorphism - People tend to make human-like qualities for non-human things, including animals and deities.

- Pancritical rationalism - All elements of science or truth should be constantly criticized and questioned, irrespective of any authority's justifications.

Deism - Reasoning is the only basis for knowledge. Thus, someone should only believe in God through reason, not tradition or gained insight.

Experientialism - Knowledge should be measured by experiences and first-hand accounts.

Foundationalism - We can be [certain](understanding-certainty.md) of beliefs when when they're based on self-evident basic beliefs that are based on non-belief things like experiences. Opposite of coherence theory of justification.

Functionalism - Since reductive materialism (see above) and logical behaviorism (see above) are wrong, we must consult [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md), [desires](purpose.md), and [emotions](mind-feelings.md) to [understand](understanding.md) people. The opposite of coherence theory of justification.

Falsificationism/Deductivism - Things are only [scientific](science.md) if there's a possibility they could be wrong.

Inductionism - We can use inductive reasoning on sets of information to create [theories and laws](lawsaxioms.md) to live by.

- Inductivism - The body of science is guided by previous scientific data, so it's always advancing toward truth.
- Psychologism - We can only grow in understanding via [philosophical study](philosophy.md).
- Scientism - We can best grow in understanding via [scientific study](science.md).

Instrumentalism - Knowledge doesn't need to be true, but must be useful.

Irrealism - We should swap phenomenalism (see above) with physicalism (see above) back-and-forth to understand things from the best perspective.

Kierkegaardianism - While truth may be absolute, finding the things that are subjective is the most important thing.

Methodological reductionism/Scientific reductionism/Occamism/Occam's razor - Explaining things should be continually reduced to the very simplest they can get, but no simpler.

- Greedy reductionism - Too many people reduce too much to too little.

Logical positivism - Philosophy should have the same rigor as [science](science.md), with strict rules for judging sentences as true, false, or meaningless.

Skepticism - Doubt things that are held as knowledge.

- Postmodernism - Question absolutely everything.
- Probabiliorism - While knowledge is impossible, strong beliefs for likely things is a good idea. Opposed to probabilism.
- Probabilism - While knowledge is impossible, strong beliefs for practical things is a good idea. Opposited to probabiliorism.
- Pyrrhonism/Pyrrhonian skepticism - All things are unprovable, so learn to be comfortable knowing nothing for certain.

Structuralism - All elements of human culture are connected to a broader system.

- Post-structuralism - Since all elements of human culture are relative, there's no certain connection between any of them but there's a type of absolute to all of it.

- Utilitarianism - An act is moral when it maximizes the most wellness for the most people.

Humanistic naturalism - assuming naturalism (see above), humans are extensions of nature, so living naturally is the best way to live, which is against [industry](jobs-specialization.md) and [technology](technology.md).

Immoralism - Since morality doesn't matter, people should strive for an aesthetic (see below) that imitates living forever.

Intellectualism - Assuming rationalism (see above), reasoning is the best way to gain understanding.

Irrationalism - Science is inferior to intuition, and the ultimate transcendence of humanity comes through art and conquering aesthetics.

Role ethics - People are best defined by their role in a [family](people-family.md).

Stoicism - Self-control of all types creates inner strength that builds harmony with the universe. Opposite of Epicureanism. Has largely been disproven by [psychology](science.md).

### Do we have free will?

Compatibilism/Soft determinism - Because we can [imagine](imagination.md) and [our environment](culture.md) profoundly impacts our decisions, determinism (see above) and free will can coexist. Opposite of incompatibilism.

Incompatibilism - Free will and determinism (see above) cannot [logically](logic.md) coexist.

Libertarianism (metaphysics) - Free will exists. Generally opposed to determinism.

## Ethics

Ethics - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of [moral values](morality.md).

Cognitivism - Ethical statements can only be true or false. Opposite of non-cognitivism.

- Moral realism - Moral judgments express beliefs, which can only be true or false, so objective moral values exist.

Emotivism/Hurrah-boo theory - We make ethical statements based on our attitude about other statements, not as stand-alone ideas.

Non-cognitivism - Ethical statements don't state facts or beliefs, so they're not matters of truth. Opposite of cognitivism.

Quasi-realism - Ethical statements aren't facts or beliefs, but do project emotional viewpoints as if they were real.

Value pluralism - Two or more moral values may be equally true, but also in conflict.

### Why are things good or bad?

Ascriptivism - Even if determinism (see above) is true, people are still responsible for their actions.

Consequentialism - The consequences from deicisions determine whether something was the right decision. Opposite of deontologism.
