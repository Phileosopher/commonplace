## parsing the past

with the events that occurred, you were:
    - innocent: you therefore endured [hardship]
    - guilty: you [sinned] and it's the logical consequences of that action
next, how you responded:
    - well: it [pleased God](God's will)
    - poorly: it displeased God
this parses into 4 domains:
    - innocent, and responded well - authentic suffering
        the best situation to be in
            face it honestly and openly
            acknowledge the confusion and hurt
            love God enough to cry out to Him
            ask others to help
            there isn't always a direct link between sin and suffering
            use the suffering to deepen your walk with God
            He only gives you temptation you can withstand
            treat it as a spiritual mission
    - innocent, responded poorly - humble analysis
        needs repentance and remedial actions to consider what had happened
        ask how you responded:
            1. did you return evil for evil?
                vengeance is the Lord's
            2. did you develop bitterness toward God?
            3. did you develop an unbiblical view of people?
            4. have you developed an unbiblical view of yourself?
            5. should you confront the person who sinned against you? and if so, have you done it?
            6. if you confronted the person who sinned against you and they asked forgiveness, have you done it?
    - guilty, responded well - joyful remembrance
        our actions bring us closer to God and others
        God is entirely faithful to forgive our sins
        there are MANY verses that indicate this (matt 26:27-28, rom 5:9, eph 1:7, col 1:20, heb 10:19, 1pe 1:18-19, rev 5:9)
        we can choose what we think about (eph 4:23, phil 4:8, 1pe 1:13, ps 42:5)
        there are 4 reasons people get stuck in the past:
            1. a lack of genuine repentance
                there is a MAJOR difference between worldly and godly sorrow (2 cor 7:9-10)
            2. the fear of man (pro 29:25, rom 8:31-39)
            3. unwillingness to leave our sin
            4. losing our awe of God's forgiving grace
    - guilty, responded poorly - honest self-confrontation
        creates additional sin, is a HUGE moral risk

5 reasons we refuse to admit our past sin:
    pride - accept that you've failed
    stubbornness - just own that you need to ask forgiveness
    fear - you're over-reacting
    foolishness - you may be doing what seems right to you, but is a bad idea
    misplaced desires - you may have desires that are being fulfilled wrongly:
        never make yourself vulnerable by admitting failures
        have the approval of people
        always have power over others
        always have the upper hand
        get back at the other person for what they did
        never let the person hurt them again

## sleep

indicate how "rest" goes farther than simply "sleep"
- maybe rename the guide "how to rest"?
