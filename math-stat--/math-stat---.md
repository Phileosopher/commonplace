## linear regression

Linear regression is a marvelous tool, versatile, scalable, and as easy to execute as clicking a button on your spreadsheet.
Whenever you want to understand which variables drive which other variables, and in which direction, it's the first thing you reach for. And it works on any data set at all.
But, like a table saw, if you use it without paying careful attention to what you're doing, the results can be gruesome.
