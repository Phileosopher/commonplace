# Botany (plant science) explained

Moving up from simple plant life, most plants have a distinct fractal-like pattern and tend to use photosynthesis. Plants tend to breathe carbon dioxide (CO2), then strip the carbon and emit oxygen as a waste product (O2).

Plants draw nutrients from the soil they live in, then combine it with CO2 from the air and sunlight to grow. Once they've grown enough, and the climate conditions are right, they will produce fruit with seeds in it to nourish the future of its kind.

Plants communicate frequently. They send signals through their roots, as well as scents to attract animals and warn other plants, and plants send ultrasonic sound waves when they're hurt.
