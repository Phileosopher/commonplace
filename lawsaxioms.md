# List of universal laws and axioms

These are philosophical rules other people have discovered, paraphrased into the simplest possible language I could make them into.

It's worth noting that I've broadened the ideas when possible. It's also worth noting that many philosophical laws didn't make this list because they don't create patterns across many domains, such as most scientific and linguistic rules.

I've grouped them starting with where the law starts coming into effect, progressing from inanimate objects, through individual perception, upwards into large groups.

I've separated the [science-specific](lawsaxioms-science.md), [design](lawsaxioms-design.md), and [technology-specific axioms](lawsaxioms-tech.md).
