# Project management for the tech industry

One of the clearest distinctions between tech projects and [most others](mgmt-2_projects.md) comes through how technology magnifies labor:

- Conceptually, an amateur can produce a certain amount per day, and an expert will produce a bit more.
- On the other hand, a computer assigned to the task can often produce exponentially more than a human, but takes more time to prepare through [robotics design](computers-robotics.md) and [software development](computers-programming.md).
- Therefore, a project will be difficult to track near the beginning (and likely won't produce *at all*), but will vastly outperform a human equivalent later on.

While Agile methodology was formed for the purpose of getting a team to synchronize plans as software was [versioned](computers-software-versionctrl.md), it can mean that weak leadership will make goalposts *constantly* move around on the project from absolutely *any* feedback on the team.
