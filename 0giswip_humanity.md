## The body

Physically, every human is merely a [mammal](https://notageni.us/science/). Beyond unusually large brains, there is nothing [scientifically](/science/) special about us. We have hair, [females](/gender/) secrete milk for their young, and we birth our young instead of laying eggs. We must eat, [rest](https://adequate.life/sleep/), and tend to our [offspring](/legacy/).

However, we're the only beings who think about the future, but tend to make errors about pretty much everything:

- Our thoughts have trouble balancing between what is vague and what is certain.
- We often [understand](/understanding/) things with an over-simplified [model](/logic/), and tend to [simplify things further](/bias/) if we're ever overwhelmed or have things that violate our [beliefs](/trust/).
- When we [try to do something](/purpose/), our bodies are very imprecise without *tons* of [practice](https://adequate.life/success-5/).

[Moral](/morality/) decisions typically involve [how we use our body](/good-life/), especially in our [language](/language/).

Like any biological being, every drive of a body is based on two primary [themes](/symbols/): [fear of death](/fear/) and [sex](/gender/). Or, in more vague terms, every action we make is either a reaction driven by fight/flight/freeze or pleasure.

One of the most prominent components of our bodies is our capacity for error. We make mistakes *constantly* in [performing actions](/results/), even when they're complete [routine](/habits/). Against anything sensible, our errors sometimes become the [creative](/creativity/) basis for permutations of those habits that actually *improve* our [performance](/results/).

Absolutely *anything* [noble or good](/morality/) must come from something beyond the body. The body completely in charge of all [decision-making](/decisions/) can even turn *moderation itself* into excess.

While the base configuration of [reality](/reality/) is semi-ordered [chaos](/unknown/), the human being is semi-chaotic order.

## The soul

If people are merely a cosmological improbability, we have no reason to presume the "soul" exists. As it stands, [science](/science/) hasn't found the soul, so there's no empirical evidence for it. The only evidence we have is that the cessation of biological function is literally impossible to restart, in all instances, after only a few minutes without oxygen or a functioning organ.

If a soul exists distinctly from the body, it only naturally stands that it'd last beyond the body's [death](/fear/). There are many competing ideas about [what happens then](/religion/), each expanding the [story](/stories/) of our existence into something we can't [know](/understanding/) right now, often with many [myths](/myths/) interspersed that add [meaning](/meaning/) to this present life.

If the soul exists, the essence of a person is that soul, and their body is simply the thing the person operates.

## Soul components

We can't know precisely what a soul *is* (including whether it's simply a component of the body), but we can still group certain things as being "soul-like" that express onto [reality](/reality/).

The soul contains the will, which finds some form of [purpose](/purpose/) through adhering to [values](/values/) that always advance some sort of [meaning](/meaning/). The stronger that will, the more determination toward that purpose. A will can partly be trained, but a large portion of the will comes from [birth](/maturity/) and [personal decisions](/decisions/).

Souls also each contain a type of [personality](/personality/), which is a product of pure [preference](/feelings/). Both preference and [decisions](/decisions/) from preference can allow multiple people to grow up in the same environment, but all respond differently to it.

The soul constructs an [identity](/identity/) from its [environment](/reality/), especially from how it observes its [creations](/creations/) and [results](/results/). Most of a person's [growth](/maturity/) comes through finding the right way to get desirable responses.

The things we're naturally [good at](/understanding/) and [like](/humanity/) doing can be defined as natural talent, which comes from the soul's interaction with the body. While it expresses as we create and build, it has its potential *long* before we become [influential](/influence/) with that talent, often when we're [children](/maturity/) before we can even [speak](/language/).

We have thoughts in our mind, which are fleeting glimpses of [patterns](/symbols/) that represent as [values](/values/). When thoughts group together enough to generate [certainty](/certainty/), they form [feelings](/feelings/) that can last longer than mere thoughts. Over a longer stretch of time, feelings can create an intuition and sensations, which profoundly affect our [understanding](/understanding/) and [personality](/personality/).

Our subconscious mind is designed to protect us by automatically performing [routine actions](/habits/), but is *ridiculously* hypersensitive to input. These inputs can either be thoughts or [environmental experience](/reality/). Anything we can potentially do automatically and regard as [unimportant](/purpose/), including our [feelings](/feelings/), can become part of that subconscious.

We have many [depicted expressions of self-concept](/image/), which are all built on the [purposes](/purpose/) within our [environment](/reality/). There are many ways to [group](/logic/) those faces, but they broadly classify as short-term selfish (the "id"), long-term selfish (the "ego"), and [love](/love/) beyond oneself for others (the "superego").

It's very possible we are nothing *but* those faces, though it's difficult to precisely tell. Either way, we *are* essentially what we [decide](/decisions/) more than what we [do](/results/). But, everyone else only [sees](/image/) what we do, and their [judgments](/image/) are typically on that aspect alone.

[Habits](/habits/) aren't part of the soul, but the soul is definitely [responsible](/meaning/) for the [choices](/decisions/) that made those habits in the first place. The chattering stream of noise in our minds are mostly those habits, which means they're only past-tense iterations of what our soul has done, with our present-tense decisions dictating what will happen in the future.

From a [moral](/morality/) perspective, the soul has plenty of [evil](/evil/). Whether you believe it's in-born or inherited, by the time people can [reason](/logic/), they will do things with the intent to harm others, and with far more capacity than any other animal is capable of performing. It's typically driven by self-interest, but a soul is often not aware of its own moral state, especially when [young](/maturity/). It can be retrained, but [requires the trainers to believe](/leftism/) the moral issue exists in the first place.

No two souls are precisely alike, but *many* overlaps are frequently [universal](/universals/) to all humanity.

Nobody is particularly unique, and not particularly mysterious compared to anyone else, but we all like to think we're more unique or mysterious in some special way. We live to gain that uniqueness (i.e., being important) and find tremendous [meaning](/meaning/) and [identity](/identity/) when others see us as special. Any uniqueness we do perceive comes through [bias](/bias/) driven by [love](/love/).

Individually, any particular human is typically accessible and pleasant-enough to coexist with. However, they become *very* dangerous and unreasonable when [provoked](/conflicts/). In [large groups](/groups-large/), any capacity for [evil](/evil/) is dramatically magnified, and that capacity is why most [political systems](/political-systems/) devolve into [dysfunction](/bad-systems/).

## Human worth

We have an odd tendency to find interest in others' mundane lifestyles. The life of a farmer, welder, cleaner, and dance instructor are all fascinating to us if we haven't worked in those specific capacities.

The only measure of human [value](/values/), besides [what we can exploit from them](/purpose/), comes from whatever is in the soul. All the properties of a body are entirely reproducible by anyone else (or even [technology](/technology/) someday), so [love](/love/) of a soul is the only way to give that person [inherent value](/values/).

People don't usually pay attention to others' legitimate human worth because they focus more on [status](/image/), [social class](/classes/), or [accomplishments](/results/). Our outward status, however, is only *loosely* correlated with a soul's values, to the degree that the person has [power](/power/) when they make their [decisions](/decisions/). The relationship between [attempts](/creations/) and [results](/results/) has an inescapable component of [luck](/unknown/).

As we age and transition through [life stages](/maturity/), we become known (and [know ourselves](https://adequate.life/awareness/)) for the [habits](/habits/) we build (and their [consequences](/results/)) *far* more than any motivations for those habits.

## Transhumanism

All [religion](/religion/) gives us directives to live in a [morally superior way](/morality/). While those morals are *not* the same according to each religion, they all give promises of humanity becoming better than it is right now. Most of them indicate that this superior existence comes after [death](/legacy/).

Beyond religion, a relatively new type of [trend](/trends/) has arisen in light of [technology](/technology/), called "transhumanism". Instead of the promises coming through moral action that leads to post-mortem payout, the promises come through technology, with the promise being a superior quality of life. At its farthest, the promises extend to ending death itself.

Many [works of fiction](/storytellers/) magnify this story, to tremendous levels. It's not unusual in this mindset to visualize humanity:

- Traveling the stars with advanced technology
- Living a non-physical life within a computer
- Transcending this physical life to become an energy-based being
- Creating life of their own, similar to God

Unfortunately, there are far too many logistical failures that almost guarantee death:

- Organic life eventually decays.
- We have never had control over anything in our essence beyond our bodies.
- We barely grasp what a "soul" is that creates life, or [its relationship](/networks/) with [whatever God is](/religion/).

## Application

The soul is the only vehicle that we keep after this life, in whatever form that expresses.

To not value a soul, while valuing anything else of a person, is to not give them true value.

Instead of the conventional wisdom that [leaders](https://notageni.us/mgmt/) are trained, the existence of a soul and will implies they're born, then fostered.

There's always more to a person than you can see. If you believe that when speaking with someone, they'll respond well to it because they've become important.

We can't directly observe a soul, and the easiest way to discover the value of a soul is through changing the situation that person is in. Make a rich man penniless, or give a low-ranking person ultimate authority. Their value is in the [virtues and goodness](/morality/) they keep or change as the situation shifts.

We are often entitled because we believe we deserve something. In truth, we only deserve things the same as anyone else (meaning we must consider the needs of everyone around us) or by our merit (which is based on [results](/results/) just as much as [intention](/purpose/)).

Humanity doesn't really change as a baseline. People will change individually, but everyone is born with approximately the same [base programming](/universals/), then adapts to their environment (which includes other humans' interactions). If the environmental stimuli stops, the new people being born will be the same as we've seen for all written history.

The transhumanism movement is doomed to never achieve immortality, mostly because their proponents haven't sufficiently grasped how the human soul works.

- Since many of them are naturalists, they consider the soul, brain, mind, and psyche to be synonyms.
- Without knowing the raw mechanisms of how we're built with absolute [certainty](/certainty/) (including [our connection](/networks/) with God), they miss a major component of how to [fix](https://notageni.us/fix/) humanity.
- It will persist, however, because it's a secular religion, filled with [myths](/myths/) and [hopes](/trust/) which are difficult to easily define but easy to [believe in](/certainty/).
