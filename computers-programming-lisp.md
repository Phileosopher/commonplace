# The Lisp languages

While many other languages were designed to fix a problem, Lisp was formed strictly as a theoretical mathematical model. For that reason, it ends up being relatively timeless and somewhat of an abstraction unto itself, a bit like C.

For that reason, there are a *lot* of languages in the Lisp family:

- Maclisp
- MDL
- Scheme
- Common Lisp
- [Emacs Lisp](computers-software-ide.md)
- [GNU Guile](computers-os-unix.md)
- Clojure
- Racket
- Hy
