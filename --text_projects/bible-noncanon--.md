Part of the Apostolic Fathers collection, some early Christians treated 1 Clement as a sacred text. It was included in some Bibles, such as the Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Hierosolymitanus, but not in the 27-book New Testament canon that is shared across most modern Christian churches. Such works are known as New Testament apocrypha, and 1 Clement ranks Didache as one of the earliest, if not the earliest, of those that still exist.

## bible code

it's worth indicating that the "Bible code" is kinda a waste of time
- we are being witnessed by a celestial host, and it's entirely possible all those patterns and stuff were totally for THEM, not us
- it doesn't affect salvation, really, so it's not worth speculating too much

## question

When was the new testament compiled?
- give a clear indication about the emergence of the canon
Is the old testament still valid if its in the Bible?

## criticisms

indicate all the academic criticisms of various Bible books, and the responses
- the Gospel accounts and their discrepancies (e.g., skeptics annotated bible)
- Daniel and when it was written

MAYBE ADD IT TO THE BACK END OF THE NON-CANONIZED BOOKS PAGE?
