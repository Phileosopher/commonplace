## Death Experiences

A question asked was whether near-death experiences open peepholes to heaven, or if
they are merely the unraveling of the brain as it approaches death. The article stated that a
decade of research has discredited some theories and produced some others: (1)
Endorphins, the morphine-like substance released by the brain during trauma, may
account for the peace and painlessness. (2) Temporal lobe seizures, which sometimes
cause the brain to replay life experiences, could result in the panoramic vision of one’s
life. (3) Out-of-body observations may be evidence that the mind and brain can exist
separately. (4) Anoxia, the lack of oxygen to the brain, could produce the sensation of
out-of-body-floating. The rush of blood to the brain as the person regains consciousness
could result in the brilliant light witnessed by some. (5) Subconscious memories of the
birth experience may account for the moving through a passageway or tunnel. (6) Near-
death images of heaven may be the mind conjuring pictures based on previous religious
instruction. (7) Near-death experiences are not death itself, and they cannot be interpreted
as visions of people who have come back from the dead.
