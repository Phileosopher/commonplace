# List of how God is graceful and merciful

This is a list of ways that God is broadly graceful.

- People often aren't creative enough to realize the *many* ways that God would have every right to be more severe.
- To that end, we frequently misinterpret what is happening around us, as if God is delivering His full and readily-delivered wrath on us.

## The Fall

When mankind sinned, God could have destroyed us entirely.

---

aka What God Had The Right To Do
God obviously can DO anything
However, He placed WAY more constraints on Himself for the sake of love toward our spiritual interests

When we sinned, He could have wiped us out immediately
- further, He could have us drop dead EVERY time we sin

He could have let us stay in the Garden and let us eat from the tree of life

He could have kept His goal for a Messiah to Himself

Hee could have wiped out all humanity with a flood INCLUDING Noah

He didn't have to use a rainbow as a sign for us
- for that matter, He didn't need to establish [covenants] with us and could simply have directed us
He could have made the Hebrew law apply to thoughts as much as actions

He could have killed Moses for his faithlessness, multiple times

He could have ditched the Hebrews at Sinai when they worshiped Ba'al

He could have completely destroyed them when they first showed up in Israel

Every single time the Hebrews veered from Him, He could have given up entirely
- instead He sends a long string of judges
- He could have destroyed Samson entirely for violating his vows

He didn't need to give Israel a king

He didn't need to redeem Israel from Goliath through David

He didn't need to guide them in exile through the prophets

He didn't need to save a remnant in Israel

He didnpt need to preserve the OT

Jesus didn't need to be born

Jesus didn't need to heal anyone

He didn't need to die

He could have not reappeared after dying

He didn't have to send the Holy Spirit to help us

He didn't have to keep the NT canon around or guide believers to consensus

He didn't need to put up with the ever-increasing evil of this age

He doesn't need to come back
