AM 1
Creation (Adam)
From Creation to Abraham, time is calculated by adding the ages of the Patriarchs when their first child is born.[19] It is possible that the period of the Genesis flood narrative is not meant to be included in the count, as Shem, born 100 years before the flood, "begot" his first son two years after it, which should make him 102, but Genesis 11:10–11 specifies that he is only 100, suggesting that time has been suspended.[20][21]

AM 1948
Birth of Abraham
The period from the birth of Shem's son to Abraham's migration to Canaan is 365 years, mirroring Enoch's life-span of 365 years, the number of days in a tropical year.[22] There are 10 Patriarchs between Adam and the flood narrative and 10 between the flood narrative and Abraham, although the Septuagint adds an extra ancestor so that the second group of 10 runs from the flood narrative to Terah.[23] Noah and Terah each have three sons, of whom the first in each case is the most important.[24]

AM 2236
Entrance into Egypt
The period between Abraham's call to enter Canaan (AM 2021) and Jacob's entry into Biblical Egypt is 215 years, calculated from the ages of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the period in Egypt is stated in the Book of Exodus (12:40) as 430 years, although the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch texts both give only 430 years between Abraham and Moses. Paul the Apostle, a writer of the New Testament, agrees with them and against the Hebrew Bible.[25]

AM 2666
Exodus
Exodus 12:40 says that Israel was in Egypt 430 years, Genesis 15:13 predicts that the oppression will last 400 years, Exodus 6:14–25 says this is made up of four generations (Levi to Moses), and Genesis 15:16 predicts Abraham's descendants will return in the fourth generation. The alternatives cannot be matched exactly, but the number 4 seems to play a central role in all of them.[26] The Exodus takes place in (AM 2666), exactly two-thirds of the way through the 4,000 years, marking it as the pivotal event of the chronology.[6] It is also two-thirds of the way through the 40 notional "generations" of 100 years each, with Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel, representing the 26th generation from Adam.[4]

AM 3146
Solomon's temple
The period from the foundation of Solomon's Temple in Solomon's fourth regnal year to its destruction in the siege of Jerusalem is 430 years. This is found by adding the reigns of the kings of the United Kingdom of Israel and of the Kingdom of Judah from the fourth regnal year of Solomon.[25] The fourth regnal year of Solomon came exactly 1,200 years after the birth of Abraham (Abraham was born in AM 1946 if the two years of the flood narrative are excluded).[27] There were exactly 20 kings in both Judah and the Kingdom of Israel following Solomon, despite Judah lasting more than a century longer than Israel.[28] "It seems very likely that [some of the minor kings of Israel] have served simply to make up the numbers".[29]

AM 3576
Exile
The period from the Siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon's Temple (AM 3576) to Cyrus's edict and the end of the Exile (AM 3626) is 50 years. Added to the 430 years for which the Temple stood, they produce another symmetrical period of 480 years.[4]

AM 3626
Edict of Cyrus
Scholars have established that the Babylonian captivity lasted approximately fifty years, but the Book of Jeremiah puts it at 70 years, "clearly on ideological grounds"[30] (the number 7 symbolises divine perfection, 10 symbolises fullness, and 7x10 gives 70 years).[31] The Book of Ezra uses a 50-year time-frame when it places the commencement of the Second Temple in Cyrus the Great's first regnal year (538 BCE), in accordance with the jubilee law of the Book of Leviticus.[32]

AM 4000
(164 BCE)
Rededication of the Temple	The final period is the 374 years between Cyrus's edicts (538 BCE) and the re-dedication of the Second Temple by the Maccabees (164 BCE).[6] The overall 4,000 year cycle is calculated backwards from this point.[33]

GENESIS 4

GENESIS 5
5 This is the written account of Adam’s family line.

When God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God. 2 He created them male and female and blessed them. And he named them “Mankind”[a] when they were created.

3 When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth. 4 After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 5 Altogether, Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.

6 When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father[b] of Enosh. 7 After he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters. 8 Altogether, Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.

9 When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan. 10 After he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters. 11 Altogether, Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.

12 When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel. 13 After he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters. 14 Altogether, Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.

15 When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared. 16 After he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. 17 Altogether, Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.

18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch. 19 After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 20 Altogether, Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.

21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. 22 After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 23 Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 24 Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.

25 When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech. 26 After he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters. 27 Altogether, Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.

28 When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. 29 He named him Noah[c] and said, “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.” 30 After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters. 31 Altogether, Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.

32 After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.

GENESIS 11
11 Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 2 As people moved eastward,[a] they found a plain in Shinar[b] and settled there.

3 They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”

5 But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. 6 The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”

8 So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 9 That is why it was called Babel[c]—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.

From Shem to Abram
10 This is the account of Shem’s family line.

Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father[d] of Arphaxad. 11 And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.

12 When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah. 13 And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.[e]
