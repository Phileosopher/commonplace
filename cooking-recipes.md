## Breakfast

### Bacon

Cut the package in half to make prep easier.

Keep bacon from shrinking:

1. Run it under cold water (and pat it dry to avoid splatter) before cooking.
2. Cook it with a millimeter of water at the bottom of the pan.

Pan-frying bacon lets bacon cook in its grease.

Cook bacon in the microwave by wrapping in paper towels on high for 3-5 minutes.

The best bacon is baked open in the oven at 365 °F (185 °C) for 10 minutes, or on tinfoil at 400 °F (204 °C) for 12 minutes.

- Baking prevents dry bacon and grease splatter.
