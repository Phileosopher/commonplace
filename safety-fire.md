# How to safely deal with a fire

Keep at least 2 small ABC fire extinguishers available, in the kitchen and bedroom:

- Make liquor bottle fire extinguishers:
  1. Dissolve a pound of salt and a half-pound of salammoniac in two quarts of water.
  2. Bottle about a quart of the mixture each in empty liquor bottles.
  3. Throw the bottles at fires when needed.
- Baking soda will also work to extinguish flames directly.

About once a month, test your smoke alarms:

- Press the test button on it until it beeps.
- If they keep going off incorrectly, move them further away from your kitchen or get alarms with photoelectric sensors.

Practice fire-prevention habits:

- Water your Christmas tree and use LED lights on it.
- Unplug devices with lithium-polymer batteries when you're not home.
- Keep grills at least a few feet away from walls.
- Avoid overloading extension cords.
- Keep a kitchen timer or stay attentive when the oven is on.

If you live on the second story or higher, keep your fire escape cleared or store a roll-up ladder nearby.

If you live in a rural area and have a body of water nearby, consider investing in a fire pump kit.
