# The JavaScript programming language

JavaScript is the language of the [internet](computers-software-webdev.md), though the internet-based version of it is technically ECMAScript. HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the appearance of the internet, and JavaScript are the muscles.

In that sense, because of the internet's ubiquity, just about everything that *can* be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in it (Atwood's Law), and JavaScript will stick around as long as [the internet](computers-sofware-webdev.md) exists.

Further, JavaScript runs a huge chunk of [game development](computers-software-gamedev.md) and most front-end content for phones.

JavaScript's only connection to Java is that it was a marketing move. Java was hot at the time, so calling something JavaScript might get some programmers interested. It obviously worked, and has now outpaced Java in popularity.
