# Trauma

Anything that isn't completely resolved in our mind *will* come back to haunt us:

- Memories of an event will force your mind to relive the shock over and over again, even after decades.
- Our post-traumatic stress makes us react impulsively against something that [triggers](habits.md) a memory.

We tend to incorrectly redirect past trauma through several possible pathways:

- Overly personalized: making a broad thing too personal
- Overly broad: making a general rule out of something specific
- Permanent association: making a permanent rule out of something temporary
- Non-association: treating the experience as *completely* unrelated to legitimately relevant things

The only solution is to patiently expose ourselves to experiences that relive the trauma until we remove the harsh emotional ties to our past.

## Releasing trauma

We tend to incorrectly redirect past trauma through several possible pathways:

- Be patient with yourself and your thoughts to let yourself work through the pain:
  - Visualize yourself as a small child, as well as everyone else involved.
  - Talk to yourself like you would talk to someone you [love](people-relationships-love.md).
  - Talk to yourself or a [friend](people-4_friends.md) about how you feel.
- Crying is one of the most effective ways to release trauma.
  - If you can't cry, yawning also releases stress.
- Focus on [meditative](awareness-meditation.md) deep breathing:
  1. Exhale completely.
  2. Take 4 seconds to inhale.
  3. Hold your breath for 7 seconds.
  4. Take 8 seconds to exhale, then repeat.
- Focus on [repetitive, mindless tasks](success-4_routine.md) to relieve tension:
  - [Cleaning](home-housekeeping.md) and [exercise](body-3_exercise.md) helps you feel a direct improvement.
  - Playing Tetris or other video games may help break from severe trauma, but only for a few hours at a time.
  - Avoid anything that takes a long time, is unproductive, or can be unhealthy (such as marathon game sessions or overeating).
  - Pain medicine numbs emotional pain along with physical pain, but don't self-medicate unless you're making a critical decision you can't postpone.
- If you can't break through after a few months of self-reflection, seriously consider professional psychotherapy to gain some traction.

Release your feelings about anything you fear or resent:

- The most effective place for [meditation](awareness-meditation.md) comes through how we can better [respond to triggers](habits.md).
  - You really can't do anything about the past, nor about others' actions, and the only person suffering from holding onto those feelings is you.
  - Whenever feelings arise, learn to repeat the mantra, "I'm having an emotional reaction."
  - At the end of any meditation session, you should only be focused on what you can actually do.
- If you have any trouble, [write down](people-writing.md) "I fear...", then list those fears as they arise.
  - At the end, you should throw out or delete the list, which [symbolizes](symbols.md) that the fears don't really matter.
  - If you find anything that makes you angry, write down "I am angry at (a being or institution) because I fear..." and fill it in.
  - Often, you'll find resentments behind resentments, so be sure to list *all* of them.
  - We have the least control over our fears and resentments, so focus specifically on them instead of any other [feelings](mind-feelings.md).
  - At the end, clearly state how you're releasing them all (e.g., "...and that's okay.", "...and it doesn't matter.", "...but [God](religion.md) is in control.")
- For your brain stem to register, you may need to connect your feelings to a physical action to release them.
  - Press your tongue to the back of your teeth.
  - Tense every single muscle in your body, increasing in intensity, then release all of the muscles at once.
  - [Go exercise](body-3_exercise.md).
  - Stamp your feet.
  - Play a high-reflex video game.
  - Take ten deep breaths, focusing particularly on the exhaling.
  - [Eat something](cooking.md) that's high-protein.
  - [Wash your hands with warm water or take a hot shower](people-2_image.md).
  - Give or request a hug from someone.
- Make releasing a [morning or evening practice](habits.md) to prevent any further buildup of fears or resentments.

## Forgiveness

Forgiveness is technically the final stage of releasing trauma.

There are multiple possible realms where we may not forgive:

- Past [decisions](decisions.md) with present consequences.
- [Goals](success-1_why.md) that weren't met.
- [Consequences](mind-creativity-results.md) we had no control over.
- [Imagination](imagination.md) about what could have been.
- [Beliefs](trust.md) about what others expect.

Beyond others, we must also forgive ourselves.

- We are typically either *much* more or *much* less forgiving toward ourselves than others.

However, it's *not* instant, and the Enright Process captures its 4 phases:

1. Uncovering: gaining insight on an [injustice](morality.md) committed.
   - The injustice doesn't have to necessarily be real, but it must feel real.
   - The largest hurdle is in uncovering what, exactly, had happened, which requires tons of willpower and honesty.
2. Decision: committing to releasing the injustice.
   - This doesn't actually mean *doing* anything about it, but more accepting the experience isn't worth holding on to it anymore.
3. Work: taking efforts to walk through the injustice and release it.
   - The work involves gaining a more thorough mental understanding of the offender and accepting whoever that person is.
   - The result of it is a sensible realization that the offender is simply a human being, and not evil incarnate.
4. Deepening: finding a type of [meaning](meaning.md) through giving up control.
   - Contrary to *any* intuition of an unforgiving person, releasing control gives a stronger connection with others, decreases negative experiences, and can often give more purpose in the rest of life.

### The three forms of forgiveness

A. Exoneration

- Usually what people imply with the word "forgive", which restores the offender completely as if the event never happened.
- There are three common exoneration situations:
  1. Someone caused a legitimate accident, but not negligently.
  2. Someone didn't understand the pain they caused.
  3. The person who hurt you:
     1. Is truly sorry.
     2. Takes full responsibility without excuses.
     3. Asks for forgiveness.
     4. Genuinely doesn't want to repeat the action.
- If someone has fully apologized and is trying or has tried to make amends, you are morally responsible to exonerate them.
- If you can't forgive someone completely repentant, there may be something more wrong with you than your offender.

B. Forbearance

- A far more common situation of "trust but verify", where the offender has only partially admitted guilt.
- Forbearance is necessary when the offender:
  1. Makes a partial or potentially inauthentic apology.
  2. Mixes blame into their expression of sorrow that implies complete innocence.
- Forbear someone if you want or need to stay on acceptable terms with them:
  1. Let go of that particular offense.
  2. Remove grudges and fantasies of revenge.
  3. Stay watchful of their behavior in the future.
- With time and [love](people-relationships-love.md), forbearance can become exoneration and full forgiveness if that person [changes](changes.md).

C. Release

- Unlike exoneration or forbearance, release is personal separation from the offense inside the mind.
- Release is always necessary for ourselves, but especially when the offender doesn't believe they did anything wrong or gives a thoroughly insincere apology with no promise of reparations.
- Release-only situations often come from:
  - Adult child abuse survivors.
  - Victims of infidelity.
  - Betrayal from friends or family members.
- Release doesn't have many requirements:
  - You don't need a continued relationship with the offender or even another encounter with them.
  - You're only required to give up trying to "fix" what happened to you.
  - Release allows you to let go of the hurt feelings and past trauma and stop defining your life with a past wound.
- Your happiness, regardless of who wronged you or how, depends on releasing all grudges and ill intent toward anyone.
  - Release isn't forgetting, but is accepting that you now bear the consequences of something that happened outside your control.
  - If you ever [go to sleep](sleep.md) without releasing the grudge, it will encode itself into your [subconscious](awareness.md) and become harder to work through later.
  - By not releasing the old pain, those people will repeatedly re-hurt you in your mind without your permission.
  - Psychotherapy, your individual efforts, or [religion](religion.md) can all get you there, but only [Christian doctrine](jesus-gospel.md) can reliably wipe away our resentments.
