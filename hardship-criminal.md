# How to deal with a criminal background

Even if you haven't officially been [incarcerated](hardship-incarceration.md), [a background check in modern society](image-modern.md) can bar you from many opportunities.

Some people who have forgiveness issues will *heavily* project their opinions onto you:

- Your existence will make them generally uncomfortable and force [inner conflicts](conflicts-inner.md) about their [unresolved trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) regarding people completely unrelated to your situation.

However, you will also be rejected from *many* jobs and rental properties for exactly 7 years from the date of the charge or sentencing.

- The reason why is because it's not illegal to use your background as a data point in an [insurance](money-insurance.md) company's actuarial tables.
  - In practice, it can cost $100-500 additional per month to hire a convict over someone with a clean record.

Over time, people will have a harder time justifying their opinions if you [stay away from legal trouble](legal-safety.md):

- You'll start to see consequences of clean living in as little as 6 months or a year.
- After about 10 years, you can put most of the situation behind you.
- However, expect that all involved and allied governments will mistreat and reject you for the rest of your life.
- At the same time, a country that *hates* the sentencing country may have an opposing opinion for you, so expand your options.

Not all cultures see incarceration the same:

- Generally, more corruption means more people are unfairly imprisoned, and the rest of society won't take it as seriously.
  - Political corruption in the USA is relatively small compared to other nations, so a higher percentage of people in prison deserve to be there.
- Carefully consider your long-term lifestyle decisions about [moving](home-moving.md) to any country in light of your background.

Even when a situation is expunged or thrown out, expect every criminal case to be part of your [public reputation](image-modern.md) forever.

- You can't really "erase" it, but you *can* overwrite it.
- Often, your background can be the starting point of an *amazing* story (e.g., [Dave's Killer Bread](https://daveskillerbread.com)).
