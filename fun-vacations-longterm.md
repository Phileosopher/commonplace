# Planning multi-day trips

Plan the event as early as possible, which may mean 6--12 months out if it's a cruise or timeshare.

Schedule time off work for the trip, and give 1--2 days if possible before and afterward to recover from jet lag and travel stress.

To withstand the journey, get a high-quality wheeled suitcase and a lightweight, sturdy bag that can easily fit in an overhead compartment.

Arrange for everything in your absence:

- Have someone watch your house and if you have a [pet](fun-pets.md), arrange for a sitter
- Arrange for [childcare](parenting-1_babies.md) if your child isn't going
- Ask the post office to hold your mail
- Empty your fridge

Get the required paperwork done as soon as you can:

- Verify your passport is current with the correct visas and that you're free to travel to that nation.
- Get traveler's checks or small denominations of foreign currency.
- Most countries need cash, especially poor ones, but you can get by with bank cards in wealthier ones.

If the region is particularly dense with mosquitos or disease, consider getting vaccinated.

Learn the culture *before* you go:

- [Local laws](legallysafe.md) and how they differ from your home nation.
- Commonly-practiced [customs](people-rules.md).
- [Learn a few popular phrases](mind-memory.md) in the local language.
- The general [geography](logistics-navigation.md) of the region.
- Local [weather patterns](weather.md).
- Crime statistics, especially within various regions of cities.
- [Food](cooking.md) and water safety risks.
- The likelihood and forms of [corruption](legallysafe.md).
- Political threats that may exist in the region, especially regarding your nationality.
- The [economic](economics.md) exchange rate of currency.

[Traveler's insurance](insurance.md) is *always* worth the expense if you're visiting an unfamiliar [culture](culture.md), though a standard renter's or homeowner's insurance policy can cover at least part of the risk.

If the region doesn't provide universal [health coverage](body-4_health.md), traveler's health insurance is also worth the cost.

Consider a separate bank card or credit card attached to a vacation-only expense account, preferably without high fees for that particular region.

Reserve your transportation:

- Fly if your trip is more than 1,000 miles away.
  - Only take an alternate form of transportation (e.g., train, cruise ship) if a long trip is part of the vacation itself.
  - If you have two people, pick a window seat and aisle seat for the chance to have an empty seat in between (you can ask to swap seats with the middle person otherwise).
  - To keep your sleep cycle, schedule a night flight.
- For shorter distances, avoid flying and consider alternate transport like trains or long-distance bus.
- Arrange for transportation to and from the airport or depot.
- Have a backup plan if you miss any flight or transfer.

Reserve your lodging:

- Try to find places close enough to the events you want, but far enough away that you can afford it.
- You can negotiate many things like hot breakfast in bed for free (if they offer a hot breakfast buffet) or a room upgrade.
- For a unique lodging experience, try [Unusual Hotels Of The World](http://www.unusualhotelsoftheworld.com/).
- If you request it, the hotel can't guarantee a king-size bed, so call to confirm and call the day before you leave.

Buy tickets for every event you can before leaving, and have a backup plan for the ones you can't.

Plan a general itinerary:

- While it feels like work, it lets you have the most fun.
- Unless you rush it, you can usually only attend 3--4 attractions each day.
- If you prefer, create a few lists instead of a day-by-day plan:
  - Must Go To, that you feel are critical for your vacation
  - Want To Try, which fill in gaps
  - Wish To Try, which will probably not happen

Research the power adapter standards for the location you're going to.

To avoid extreme fees, ask your mobile phone provider their rates for that region or disable your mobile data on your device.

Make multiple printed copies of all travel documents, and store them in separate places.

## If you need, consider a sabbatical

Sabbaticals, unlike vacations, are unstructured and allow you to take your time.

Since you're in the area for a while, you can typically [earn a living](jobs-1_why.md) while taking time off from your career.

The only true way to experience a region's local [culture](culture.md) is to live in it for at least a few months.

While a sabbatical is often a dramatic change and *far* more unpredictable, you're guaranteed to find more [meaning](meaning.md) from the journey than visiting for a few days.
