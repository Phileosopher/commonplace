# Mark commentary

Likely written between 60 and 70 AD

Likely written by John Mark, a companion of Peter. Early church fathers like Papias attest to it being the documents and experiences of Peter.

The theme revolves around the suffering servant, and was written toward Gentile Roman citizens (who valued their conceit as the [virtue](morality-virtues.md) of "dignity" or "honor").

Its narrative is fast-paced and action-oriented, and focuses on Jesus' actions more than teachings with vivid storytelling to keep readers engaged.
