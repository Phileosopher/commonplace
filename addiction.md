Every single thing we use more than once gives a diminishing return:

- Diminishing return is the fact that using one more of something will be slightly less effective than the previous one.

We abuse a substance when we expect more than it can provide, then ignore diminishing return:

- Most people think of drugs or alcohol, but there are [many, *many* more](addiction-substances.md).
- Absolutely *any* [habit](habits.md) in the wrong time or place can become an addiction.

Addicts will continue investing more and more resources into their substance until they start destroying friendships in the process:

- The earlier you detect an addiction, the less you will lose from it.

*Every* addiction recovery group uses some derivative of the 12-step program made by Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith in 1939:

1. Admit you have no power over your substance and can't manage your life anymore.
2. Come to believe God can restore your sanity.
3. Decide to give your will and life over to God's care.
4. Conduct a fearless, thorough personal moral inventory.
5. Admit to God, yourself, and another person the exact nature of your wrongs.
6. Become entirely ready for God to remove all those character defects.
7. Humbly ask God to remove your shortcomings.
8. Make a list of everyone you've harmed and become willing to make amends with all of them.
9. Make direct amends to them wherever possible, except when it would injure anyone.
10. Keep taking personal inventory and promptly admit when you're wrong.
11. Work to improve your conscious contact with God through [meditation](awareness-meditation.md) and praying, asking only for knowledge of God's will for you and for power to carry it out.
12. With the spiritual awakening from the first 11 steps, try to carry the message to other addicts and to practice its principles in everything.

In practice, recovering from an addiction is treating yourself like an extremely strong-willed small child, with the "adult" regulating yourself with a set of standards independent of yourself.

There is a simple way to detect whether someone has a substance abuse problem:

1. Ask the people closest to them if that person has a problem with that substance.
2. Omit the negating testimonies of everyone who has their own over-involvement with that substance (or something similar).
3. If that omits all of that person's known associates, carefully consider if that substance is connected to the matter.
