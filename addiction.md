There is a simple way to detect whether someone has a substance abuse problem:

1. Ask the people closest to them if that person has a problem with that substance.
2. Omit the negating testimonies of everyone who has their own over-involvement with that substance (or something similar).
3. If that omits all of that person's known associates, carefully consider if that substance is connected to the matter.
