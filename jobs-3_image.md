# How to craft a career image

A job search is you, a product, marketing yourself to potential employers:

- Every rule of [marketing](marketing.md) applies to your job search.
  - You're trying to tell a convincing [story](stories.md) to a manager who needs someone for a job role.
- You're a consultant filling a role, not simply a commodity.

Besides [crafting a résumé](language-writing-resume.md), your [social network](networks-social.md) presence is a critical portion of the job search:

- Even if you don't use social networks, a void in your online presence will make hiring managers wonder why.
- Display great photos throughout your networks that enforce your "personal brand".
- Bring your [creative works](mind-creativity.md) into your public image.

*Anything* you've made public on the internet is available to hiring managers:

- Employers often pass on a candidate from what they find on a social network or background check.
- Look at your online image, even the portions you feel are private.
- Take some time to clean up your informal social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).

It's not about what you know, or *who* you know, but *how* you're remembered:

- Learn to [write](language-writing.md) and [speak](language-speaking.md) effectively.
- Your *last* impression on people is the most important.

If you're changing industries, note any differences between them:

- Observe differences in [culture and norms](people-3_respect.md), as well as their [motivating values](purpose.md) and [beliefs](values.md).
- Use your intuition to gauge the industry-specific [personality types](personality.md) you'll likely encounter.
- Make a quick response to describe why you're changing (or changed) industries.

Keep an eye out for discrimination, since it's [a fact of life](hardship-discrimination.md).

## Buy business cards

Business cards are cheap and the easiest way to appear networking-savvy.

Make the business card a consulting business card by sharing what you want to do instead of your current job title.

Include everything someone needs to preview your work and get in touch with you:

- Your name
- Contact information with an e-mail and phone number:
  - Make sure your email is professional-sounding, either with your website domain or with your first/last name/initials.
  - Don't put your work phone number on the card because that will change when you find a new job.
- Links to any relevant work or websites
- Your website domain (if you have one) or a LinkedIn profile link

## LinkedIn profile

Your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile is even more of a living document than your résumé:

- LinkedIn expresses *much* more information than a résumé, so don't copy-paste information from your résumé to LinkedIn.
- A résumé records the past, but LinkedIn profiles show a pattern through the present and future.
- A LinkedIn profile changes with career moves, new skills, life events, and accomplishments, so update significant career changes as they happen.

To show the multiple dimensions of your talent, fill out your profile as thoroughly as you can.

Since LinkedIn is a social network, frequently use the "I" pronoun and [write a story](language-writing.md) with a personable tone that potential employers may want to see.

### Employers can sift through LinkedIn profiles

Since they're skimming search results, use proper keywords, industry-relevant terminology, and great résumé words throughout your profile:

- Accomplished, created, developed, improved, increased, on time, reduced, researched, under budget, won

Avoid overused and abused jargon:

- analytical, creative, driven, effective, expert, innovative, organizational, patient, responsible, strategic
- Since jargon words change over time, adapt your terms to avoid sounding stale.

### Upload a good-looking profile photo

People are *far* more likely to visit a profile with a photo.

Pay for a professional photographer to take your photo.

Consider grooming, lighting, camera angles, and any camera distortion or editing that may affect your photo's story.

Dress formally, take the photo by yourself, smile in it, and don't wear sunglasses.

### Customize your profile URL

Use a specific title like your name to make links more intuitive.

### Make yourself reachable

Display your email address and links to other social networks or your website.

If you contribute to it, link to your company blog.

Accept connections with people you haven't met yet.

### Optimize your location

Clarifying a specific city lets local employers find you.

Use the ZIP code you work in or want to work in, *not* the place you live.

### Title and introduction

Use a professional title:

- You have 110 characters in the headline to grab someone's attention.
- People who view your profile are looking for solutions, not gimmicks.

The title and introduction should answer who and how you can help the hiring manager.

### Professional summary

The summary should expand on your professional headline and, if done correctly, will close the deal.

You have up to 2,000 characters to sell yourself and the context of the profile.

Make a 3x3 summary - 3 paragraphs with 3 or fewer sentences each:

- Reiterate your headline's purpose in the first paragraph.
- Specify your work in the second paragraph.
- Use your long-term goals to give a concise call to action that clarifies why someone should contact you.

### The rest of the profile

Make the profile visually appealing to skim through.

Align yourself with your industry.

Fill in your work experiences:

- Describe in paragraph form how you impacted the organization.
- List about five of your key accomplishments or duties under your paragraph.
- Show three previous jobs in your work experience.

Show 2-4 examples of any work you're proud of:

- Videos
- Presentations
- Documents
- Website content
- e-books
- Projects
- Test scores
- Awards & honors
- Patents
- Certifications, college degrees, any other courses
- Publications
- Volunteering and causes
- Languages you can communicate with

Round out your profile with other background elements:

- Interests and professionally relevant hobbies
- Knowledge about your industry
- Involvements with professional or personal organizations

### Connect with many contacts

Search back to connections you know from the past, and make any real-life connections via LinkedIn.

Join relevant LinkedIn groups to open doors for networking:

- Add meaningful discussion to message boards and comment threads.
- At all costs, avoid any arguing or disrespect.
  - Since public conflicts and prejudices are *highly* unprofessional, you'll incur public shame and hiring managers will see it.

### Manage your endorsements and recommendations

Add at least 5 skills connected to your desired job.

Add "soft skills" that fit your [personality](personality.md):

- Always punctual, creative thinker, critical thinker, easily adapts, friendly personality, good communicator, interpersonal communicator, social, team player, well-organized, quick study

Boldly ask for Recommendations from people who know your work:

- Endorsements are quick "likes" of others' skills while Recommendations are searchable and communicate more.
- Don't ask for a Recommendation from a co-worker or boss you've worked with for less than 6 months.
- Ask clients who genuinely love your work.

Freely give specific, helpful Recommendations to people you value and have worked with.

### Status updates

Consistently update your LinkedIn status with appropriate industry-related news:

- The best time to post is in the morning on weekdays.
- Add links, images, and videos when applicable to improve the posts.

Only repost content if it has industry-relevant insights, new industry-relevant products and services, or your opinion.

Write about a career-relevant passion [if you can communicate it well](language-writing.md).

Avoid over-posting:

- Post less than 20 times a month.
- Don't auto-post other social channels to LinkedIn.
- Don't auto-post a website feed unless it's industry-relevant.

## Other social networks/sites

Use any job sites or [social networks](networks-social.md) your industry typically uses.

At the same time, don't spend time on any employment social networks or job sites with very few job posts.

The purpose of a social network is to communicate, so make sure you're communicating the right ideas to the right audience.

Try to avoid misusing a social network outside its original design (e.g., Pinterest for essays).

## Keep your profiles current

Social networks change frequently and affect your image, so follow up on any alerts and notifications about your profile.

Keep your current position and accomplishments updated as they change.

Refer to your social profiles and websites in email signatures, web pages, business cards, and anywhere else it would make sense.

The creative nature of a job profile means it's open to interpretation, so *none* of these are hard-set immaculate rules.

You'll never be fully ready, and you'll be tweaking your approach as you go, so when you feel you have a decent-enough image for presentation, it's *finally* time to [get job hunting](jobs-4_hunt.md).
