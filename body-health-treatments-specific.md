## Parasites

People often aren't aware they have parasites:

- The body experiences general inflammation.
- The parasites steal iron, B vitamins, and amino acids from food.
- Parasites produce ammonia and other neurotoxins that cloud thinking.
- Digestion becomes chaotic because they damage intestinal lining to cause bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, and unpredictable bowel movements.
- Parasites are most active at night, so sleep can often be interrupted between 2-3 a.m.
- Cravings become uncontrollable because parasites provoke carbohydrate cravings.
- Skin breakouts come from the body trying to expel toxins.

Take a combination of ivermectin and fenbendazole every single day.

- Unlike most other anti-parasitics, it also strengthens the body to prevent a relapse.

## Wrinkles

Most wrinkle-preventing solutions don't work, but tretinoin (branded as Retin-A) does.

- It also increases UV intake, meaning an increased chance of sunburn.
