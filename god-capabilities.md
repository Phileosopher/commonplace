## What's Possible

This doesn't reflect what God *will* do, and everything here represents only a fraction of the possibilities.

- God controls all physical elements, from [celestial objects](science.md) to [quantum superstates](quantum.md).
- He also controls the [consequences](mind-creativity-results.md) of all [decisions](decisions.md) ([Proverbs 16:33](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm)).
- He also controls all [managed decisions](mgmt-1_why.md) directly ([Proverbs 21:1](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-1.htm)).
- God does have a [pattern](bible-patterns.md), but He's [creative](mind-creativity.md) enough that He doesn't do things the same way twice.

We often don't keep track of the mundane miracles, which works against our ability to have faith that God has everything under control.

The ordering is approximated from the least to most required faith in God's provision.

### No Money

1. Unexpected windfalls can come in the course of the workday.
2. Transactions can get held up from mundane or unnatural events.
3. Tax credits or government programs can sometimes coincide with lost income.
4. Financial windfalls can come before or during a dramatic [hardship](hardship.md).
5. People in church or work can give money after hearing about a hardship.
6. Sometimes money is hidden or lost somewhere.
7. The Holy Spirit can provoke strangers to give without solicitation.

### No Food

1. There may be a hidden cache of food somewhere, or something nature provides.
2. A government program gives out food under specific conditions.
3. A church food ministry or individuals give boxes of food.
4. The presently available food supply will decrease at an unpredictably slower rate.
5. The food's shelf life will last an unexpectedly long time.
6. An unexpected windfall of surplus food can happen before or during a hardship.
7. Someone else's misfortune provides (e.g., neighbor's fridge breaks down).
8. Food instantly appears.

### Health Issues

1. Doctors may misdiagnose something as dangerous.
2. There is a known remedy that can be implemented to cure someone.
3. There's a known remedy that's controversial or experimental enough to be in another country.
4. People may innovate a new [technology](technology.md) that cures the person.
5. There may be an unusual practice that creates a seemingly miraculous recovery.
6. Someone may perform an act of faith over someone afflicted that God honors.
7. There may be an unusual miraculous recovery without provocation.
8. God may send a believer home, or a nonbeliever to their final judgment.

### Government Oppression

1. Another believer may help out to mitigate the government's actions.
2. Other believers may confuse or misdirect government officials.
3. Other secular people may confuse or misdirect government officials.
4. Other people create political action that stops an activity from happening or recurring.
5. Government workers may overlook certain important details or not pay attention.
6. Technical people (e.g., computer hackers) can obscure activities or disrupt government involvement.
7. A war may intervene in government procedures or change them entirely.
8. A natural disaster or unusual event may intervene in government procedures.
9. A technicality in the law over a seemingly unrelated matter makes someone's actions inapplicable to a specific law.
10. Civil unrest deteriorates the quality of how well laws can be enforced.
11. A miraculous event opens jail doors or causes health issues to the government worker.
