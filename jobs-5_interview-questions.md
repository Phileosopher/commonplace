  - If the employer refuses to proceed without salary information, leave the interview.

## Illegal Questions

Before entering an interview, research the regional questions that employers can't legally ask:

- Age, race, ethnicity, citizenship, national origin
- Personal details like height, weight, club affiliations, religion
- Disabilities unrelated to the job
- Felonies, convictions, arrest record, some military records

You can only respond to an employer's illegal question with three possible answers:

1. Answer the question directly, but give information unrelated to the job that may sabotage their view of you.
2. Refuse to answer the question, but unintentionally phrase it to appear uncooperative or confrontational.
3. Examine the question for its intent and respond to it as it might apply to the job.
   - e.g., "Have you been to prison?"
     - "I've never stolen from a company."
     - "I have a clean criminal record."
     - "I made terrible decisions, but I've changed and those events are behind me."
   - In general, answer the question they can legally ask.

Even then, experienced interviewers can find ways to ask roundabout not-illegal-but-gets-the-concept-across questions:

- "In the event that we provide a job offer, it will be conditional upon a successful background check. Is there anything beforehand you wish to disclose?"
- "We have certain conditions for employment that may involve a successful background check. Are you comfortable with that arrangement?"

Unfortunately, if they don't want to hire you based on a condition you can't control, you can't do much.

- If they seem uncomfortable with anything about this question, save yourself the effort and time by leaving in the middle of the interview.

## Their Final Question

A hiring manager's last question is typically "do you have any questions for us?", and they ask it for several reasons:

- They want to see how good of a listener you are (i.e., asking questions they already covered).
- They're giving room for you to expand your understanding of the company and job.
- They want feedback to see whether you still *want* the job.
- Your question's framing gives them insight about why you're interested in the job.

Ask 2-4 legitimate questions based on your interest in the company:

- Your questions are usually the very last impression you'll leave them with.
- A little suspicion is perfectly acceptable (and they usually expect it).
- Keep track of time, and jump ahead to your most important question if you're coming up close to the 30-minute/1-hour mark.

You should *never* ask some questions...

- ...which imply entitlement and high expectations:
  - When will I be promoted?
  - When can I expect a raise?
  - Will I get an office?
- ...which imply a noncommittal attitude:
  - What's the salary for this position?
  - What are your benefits?
  - Will I travel around a lot?
  - What other jobs are available here?
- ...which imply laziness:
  - What sort of flextime options do I have?
  - Are there security cameras watching everything I do?
  - What are your dress code rules?
- ...that show you care more about job security than personal growth:
  - What is the retirement plan like?
- ...that imply a lifestyle with many medical bills:
  - What medical plan do you provide?
- ...that demonstrate a fear of competition:
  - How many other people are going for this position?
- ...which imply you'll exploit the job's advantages:
  - Do I get employee discounts?
  - Do you have any lunch perks or a food allowance?
- ...which imply they'll have to repeat themselves frequently:
  - (Any question that shows you haven't been listening)

- Do you have any reservations or concerns about my fit for this position?
- Are there any parts of my experience you would like me to elaborate on?
- Based on my background and skills, how well do I fit the position?

Change-provoking questions (implies you'll create change):

- Is this team equipped to finding better and more efficient ways to do things?

- Assuming I'm hired, how can I add the greatest value to the organization in the first 30 days?
