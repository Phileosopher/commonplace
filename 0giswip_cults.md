A cult is a broad term representing a wide variety of concepts:

1. A [religion](/religion/) someone regards as unorthodox or spurious.
2. Great [devotion](/addiction/) to a [person](/humanity/), [idea](/values/), [object](/reality/), [movement](/trends/), or [work](/creations/).
3. A [small group](/groups-small/) who identify heavily with the above.
4. A [formal system](/logic/) of religious beliefs and rituals.

Like the concepts of [power](/power/) or [hacking](https://trendless.tech/hacking/), we [intuitively](/feelings/) know it when we see it, but have a hard time [defining it](/language/).

In short, a cult is most easily defined as "[group](/groups-small/) [gaslighting](/influence/)", and has the following elements:

1. A [charismatic](/influence/) leader who first embodies the group's [values](/values/), then the group trends to following their [personality](/personality/) as the values phase out
2. Extreme viewpoints relative to the [surrounding culture's norms](/culture/)
3. A [strict](/rules/), formal group hierarchy that [severely enforces](/taboo/) those viewpoints
4. The group violates members' [rights and boundaries](/boundaries/) while also redefining the [members'](/groups-member/) thoughts and feelings

## Undue influence

Undue influence is a [legal term](https://notageni.us/legal-dictionary/) where an entity takes advantage of their [position of power](/power-types/) over another entity:

- [Deception](/image-distortion/)
- [Flattery](/influence/)
- [Outright lies](https://adequate.life/lying/)
- [Coercion](/power-types/)
- [Subliminal messages](/symbols/) (e.g., hypnosis)

Any person, however, only becomes a victim of undue influence when several simultaneous conditions happen:

1. They trust a person with [influencing skills](/influence/) as an authority figure farther than that person's legitimate authority.
2. That authority figure has a [story](/stories/) that doesn't reflect or accommodate [reality](/reality/).
3. That person decides to trust the authority figure's [story](/stories/) over their [understanding](/understanding/).

## Power

Most large groups use the [power of influence](/influence/) in some capacity, but cults use that influence and [trust](/trust/) toward *very* unhealthy [purposes](/purpose/):

- The leadership are selfish and direct most contributed resources toward their interests.
- A leader is delusional toward believing they must follow directives that transcend mankind's judgment.
- A leader is delusional to believing they are simply operating toward the common interests of humanity.

Most cults start with at least a few of several distinct experiences:

1. A deluge of [affection and kindness](/love/) by existing members to the new member ("love bombing").
2. Grandiose promises of avoiding [pain](https://adequate.life/hardship/) or never having to [die](/legacy/).
3. Promises of special [power](/power-types/) unattainable otherwise, typically through becoming part of an elite society or ruling [class](/classes/).

To gain the necessary influence and maintain it, cult leaders are a *very* specific type of [personality](/personality/):

- Openness to Experience
  - High-enough Openness to express ideas in a new way, or revisit old ideas and share them with a new approach.
  - High-enough Intelligence to craft [believable lies](https://adequate.life/lying/).
- Conscientiousness
  - High-enough Orderliness to maintain a set of rules that everyone abides by, but not so high that they defer to another external authority.
- Extraversion must be high enough to encourage and inspire people to follow them.
- Agreeableness
  - Low-enough Compassion to not care how others may feel.
  - Extremely high Politeness, which lends itself to them being charismatic.
- Neuroticism doesn't really matter, but they have to reframe their emotional reactions as still having some form of authority (e.g., a prophet, righteous anger).
- Further, Cluster B personalities are *always* capable of running a cult from their single-minded [pursuit of power](/purpose/).
- Generally, they will seem like one of the nicest and relatable people ever, but will be *very* [influential](/influence/) to bring others to their way of thinking.

## Recruitment experience

A cult proponent must be suggestible and malleable enough that they'll believe a consistent [pattern](/symbols/) of indoctrination from a single source across months and years.

Only a specific group of [personalities](/personality/) will *ever* [choose](/decisions/) to join a cult:

- Openness to Experience
  - Low-enough Openness to simply [trust](/trust/) someone else for information.
  - High-enough Openness to adopt new [trends](/trends/) foreign to their lifestyle.
  - Low-enough Intelligence to not ask questions that would make the leadership demonstrate they *don't* [understand](/understanding/) everything.
- Conscientiousness doesn't really matter, though the cult will need to be *much* more consistent and complex with their rules proportional to that person's conscientiousness.
- Extraversion doesn't matter much, though introverts may be more susceptible from less social feedback from outside sources.
- Agreeableness
  - High-enough compassion to feel compelled to respond to shame.
  - High-enough politeness to desire honoring the group's standards.
- Neuroticism
  - High-enough withdrawal to let their feelings define their decisions.
  - High-enough volatility that a cult leader can routinely exploit their feelings.

However, long-term cults will adopt a few other types of people:

- Cluster B personality disorders will join a cult for [personal gain](/purpose/).
- People [suffering severe hardship](https://adequate.life/hardship/) will join cults if they think that's their only option.
- Anyone born into a cult [family](/family/) will adopt the [lifestyle](/culture/) and a severe [false self](/personality/) which conforms to the above simply to survive.

Usually, joining a cult requires a large personal sacrifice.

- This sacrifice ensures the member has found [meaning](/meaning/) for the rest of their interactions with the group, since their efforts will validate that the sacrifice was worth it.
- Further sacrifices compound onto the first sacrifice, meaning they develop *more* of a sense of meaning as they continue to give over everything to the group.
- Eventually, they've sacrificed all sense of [self](/humanity/), [identity](/identity/), [ownership](/boundaries/), or [agency](/decisions/), and are so deeply entrenched into their efforts that the slightest [hope](/certainty/) of any redemption can [keep them going](https://adequate.life/success-5/).

## Advancing

Incrementally, the members are then introduced to further sacrifices to release control to the group, one small step at a time (BITE Model):

1. Behavior control - their [physical reality](/reality/):
   - The collective group ends up owning *all* their individual [creations and results](/results/).
   - This typically starts with [legitimately good habits](https://adequate.life/), then moves to more intimate control methods.
2. Information control - how they [understand](/understanding/) [reality](/reality/):
   - The group will typically give clear answers to more [controversial matters](/conflicts/), then work inward to otherwise non-negotiable or [taboo](/taboo/) beliefs.
3. Thought control - how they [think](/values/):
   - Their values will be subtly shifted to conform with the group's shared standards.
4. Emotional control - how they [feel](/feelings/):
   - Without any [philosophical connection](/philosophy/) to their understanding, submitting their feelings naturally follows as well.

By the end, the person has been transformed into a perfect extension of the leader's [desires](/purpose/):

- Complete compliance to the group's [cause](/purpose/), which is open to change if it's driven by a charismatic [personality](/personality/) more than a [value system](/values/).
- Tremendous hatred of everything that obstructs the group's cause, sometimes to the point of [violence](/war/).
- Trusting the group more than themselves for just about everything, with all [conversations](/conversation/) involving the group or group activities.
- Any time they experience a [conflict](/conflicts/) with an outside source, they defer or deflect to their group's authority.

**Behavior control** involves [changing habits](/habits/), and is the most obvious for the public to notice:

- Instilling dependency and obedience, with permission required for all major [decisions](/decisions/).
- Rewards and punishments modify positive and negative behaviors.
- Rigid rules:
  - How, where, and who that person can live with, associate with, or isolates from.
  - How, where, and who that person can have sex, wear clothing, choose hairstyle, eat/drink.
  - Manage, manipulate, or restrict their [sleep](https://adequate.life/sleep/), leisure, entertainment, or vacation time.
  - An unreasonable amount of time spent with any type of [indoctrination/rituals](/habits/).
- Financially exploit them, manipulate them, or require them to be dependent.
- Punishing disobedience with beating, torture, burning, cutting, rape, or tattoo/branding.
- Threatening harm to family or friends or separating families.
- Forcing rape or for them to rape, encouraging corporal punishment, imprisonment, or murder.

**Information control** involves a *lot* of [image distortion](/image-distortion/):

- Deliberately, systematically lying to the person, often consistently across all members.
  - Only leadership is permitted to decide who needs to know what, and when.
- Minimizing access to non-approved [sources of information](/storytellers/):
  - Extensive use of [propaganda](/storytellers/) to advance an agenda, including snippets of outside information given with extensive context.
  - The group is publicly encouraged to shame and discredit outside information sources.
  - To accommodate the growing conflicts, sharing [myths](/myths/) together that clarify why they're experiencing conflicts and that they're the hero of that conflict.
- Using an Outside vs. Inside doctrine:
  - The mindset is that nobody can understand the group's ideas unless they're in the group.
  - Ensures information is not freely and equally accessible.
  - Uses different levels of information control within the group.
- Encourages spying among members:
  - Uses a partnering system to monitor and control members' knowledge.
  - Any deviant thoughts, feelings, and actions are reported to leadership.
- Uses confession unethically:
  - The leadership use any information about transgressions to disrupt and dissolve identity boundaries.
  - [Forgiveness and exoneration](https://adequate.life/happiness-2/) are withheld until they perform a significantly burdensome sacrifice to repay it.

**Thought control** is a [philosophical](/philosophy/) redirection that conforms a mind to a predetermined [value system](/values/):

- Members are required to internalize the group's doctrine as [absolute truth](/certainty/).
  - This doctrine is subject to a black-and-white dichotomy, with no room for exceptions.
  - Only "good" or "proper" thoughts are permitted, which forbids *any* criticism of the leader, doctrine, or policy.
  - Rejection of [rational analysis, critical thinking](/logic/), and [constructive criticism](/understanding/).
  - Alternative belief systems are illegitimate, evil, or not useful, which may include *other* cults or [reality itself](/reality/).
- Through repetition, manipulate memories to falsely insert past events that hadn't happened.
- The member is required to adopt a new [name](/language/) and [identity](/identity/).
- Copious amounts of [jargon and cliché](/language/) statements that obstruct access to [understanding](/understanding/).
- [Hypnosis](/habits/) that alters mental states, undermine conscious thought, and can even make members [regress in age](/maturity/):
  - Denial, rationalization, justification, or [wishful](/trust/) thinking
  - Chanting, mantras, and meditation
  - Praying, speaking in tongues, singing, or humming

**Emotional control** manipulates and narrows the range of [feelings](/feelings/) applied to experiences:

- Declaring some feelings as inherently wrong.
  - Teaching emotion-stopping techniques to block specific unpleasant feelings like homesickness, anger, and doubt.
- Direct the person's feelings to them believing problems are *always* their fault, and never the leader's or group's fault.
- Promoting feelings of guilt or unworthiness:
  - [Identifying](/identity/) with inadequacy
  - Not living up to their potential
  - Insufficient or deficient [family](/family/)
  - A condemned past, including guilt imposed by history/society
  - Unwise affiliations
- Instilled [fear](/fear/) of many things:
  - Thinking independently
  - Others' disapproval
  - The outside world without the group
  - Rejection, leaving, or being shunned by the group
  - Enemies and what they could do
  - Losing [salvation](/religion/)
  - Advancing various phobias that promote staying within the group
- Anger at everyone who *does* leave the group for being weak, undisciplined, not spiritual, brainwashed by family/counselor/opponent, or seduced by greed.
  - This can often mix disgust (at the perceived [evils](/evil/)) and pity (for their perceived destitute state).
  - At the farthest end, they'll act on their thoughts of destroying the outside group and feel themselves to be "merciful" for performing the action.
- Extreme mood swings, with love bombing and praise one moment and utter condemnation the next.

In a [larger cult](/groups-large/), the [classes](/classes/) of leader/follower are *explicitly* enforced with formalized titles and a rigid hierarchy. Any [disputes](/conflicts/) are *never* addressed among peers, and *always* involve the leadership making a directed decision.

## Power expressed

Most [small groups](/groups-small/) can sit latent for *decades* without becoming a cult.

- They still exist, but only represent as [risks](/safety/) of becoming a cult until a charismatic personality arises to take advantage of the situation.

Some of these groups are patently obvious to anyone on the outside:

- [Violent](/war/) extremist groups (e.g., terrorists)
- Cartels and organized crime (e.g., mafia)
- [Human traffickers](/slavery/)
- [Charming](/influence/) [religious](/religion/) leaders and [human potential](/leftism/) leadership
- [Multi-level marketing](https://notageni.us/mlm/)
- Extreme [political action](/conservative-liberal/) groups
- Abusive [family members](/family/) and [spouses](/gender/)

Generally, the public only notices cults when they violate [basic human rights](/boundaries/):

- People give up their property or inheritance to the group they're swearing allegiance toward.
- A person shuns their [family](/family/) and [friends](/friendship/) while believing it's a [loving act](/love/), or leaves their family entirely.
- Belief in [corporal punishment](/rules/) without examining its basis.
- Desire to trust "God's will" to the point of letting a person die.
- Principled disregard for [human universals](/universals/) to the point of severe, permanent damage.
- Adolescents coerced toward sexual acts, permanently changing their gender, or sold as [slaves/prostitutes](/slavery/).
- Threatening people who may report child molestation or domestic violence.
- Engagement in [questionable arrangements](https://notageni.us/contracts/) with others.
- *Severely* [inappropriate behavior](/taboo/) to advance the cult's cause.

Once a cult has fully indoctrinated members, they will [decide](/decisions/) to perform acts of violence on their own:

- Killing people who [didn't deserve it](/justice/), sometimes while making it a [public spectacle](/storytellers/).
- Operating a vehicle (e.g., [auto](https://notageni.us/autos/), plane) to crash into buildings or crowds of people.
- Using weapons (e.g., guns, bombs) to attack a public place (e.g., school, convention center).

## Permitted

Some cults are vilified, but many cults can be endorsed by [strong authority figures](/groups-large/).

- Cult leadership can often curate a [public image](/image-distortion/) of generosity or kindness, even when most of the contributions don't serve anyone but the leadership.
- Cults are frequently part of the mechanism behind many [defective social systems](/bad-systems/).
- A cult may have tax-exempt or charitable [government status](/rules/).
- Most government intelligence agencies and militaries borrow from cult practices, if not outright being cults themselves.
- Many secret societies also borrow from cult practice.
- The leaders of relatively unrelated [large-scale organizations](/groups-large/) may be informally (but distinctly) all members of the same cult.
- Many [advertising-based organizations](https://notageni.us/marketing/) (e.g., marketing firms) employ cult tactics to generate leads.

In fact, while it's [taboo](/taboo/) to say in many parts of the world, many governments themselves (frequently with their [media propaganda](/storytellers/)) are cults altogether.

[Amusingly](/humor/), in a free society, each [political party](/conservative-liberal/) creates its own cult, then tends to call the other party a cult.

## Aftermath

Often, cult membership creates very severe effects upon a participant:

- Absolute sabotage of [personal freedoms](/boundaries/), to the point of having a broken [personality](/personality/) and unable to make [good boundaries](/boundaries/).
- Severe [trauma](/ptsd/) from the events performed *to* them.
- Bad [decisions](/decisions/) and [their effects](/results/) they [chose](/decisions/) to make *on behalf of* the group they trusted.

Generally, they'll veer *hard* into the polar opposite extreme value system:

- The "opposite" is defined by the mode of thought the follower takes:
  - A hyper-[religious](/religion/) cult follower will leave and become an atheist or pantheist.
  - An extremely [liberal](/conservative-liberal/) activist may become highly conservative or apolitical.
- The only way they'll ever find [a healthy balance](/good-life/) is by becoming equally entrenched in several groups until they start seeing they need to change their tactic.

The most powerful [influencers](/storytellers/) to [bring down](/conflicts/) those cults are typically the people who have [integrated their shadow self](/personality/).

- They must acknowledge they were partly responsible for submitting their [will](/decisions/) to another person.
- They *also* must acknowledge they were a victim of that leader exploiting their [trust](/trust/).

* * * * *

## Application

While cults are sometimes obvious, there's a *spectrum* of cult-like behavior based on how much that group violates its members' [boundaries](/boundaries/) with their consent. On one end, it's a [well-marketed](https://notageni.us/marketing/) product that implies a greater sense of meaning than what it really is, and goes all the way to a top-down [authoritarian](/rules/) society that advances genocide.

All [addictions](/addiction/) are cults of 1+ people centered on that substance.

Gaslighting is a person trying to create a cult with a 1-person following.

The more [addicted](/addiction/) and isolated away from the rest of humanity, the more cult-like that group becomes. This has no limit, and can (but doesn't always) apply to most parts of society:

- Geek subcultures
- Hobby and political clubs
- Church groups
- Indigenous tribal societies
- Small towns
- Large corporations
- Social media

Calling something a cult isn't very relevant because most things in life have their cult [subculture](/culture/). Instead, look at *who* calls it a cult.

Because of the [range of our personalities](/personality/), even a country-sized cult only has some adherents, with the rest only honoring the [culture](/culture/) for their [advantages](/purpose/). Even "mass formation psychosis" can only get 60-70% of the people all at once.

To take extreme ownership of your life, with your thoughts, is essentially grabbing control of yourself and making a "cult" of your [personality](/personality/), for yourself alone.
