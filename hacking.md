# What hacking is

Specifically with computers, the word "hack" has a few specific meanings:

1. Illegally gain access to a computer system.
2. Improvise a solution to a hardware/software limitation, often implied as a [creative](mind-creativity.md) solution.

Hacking has gotten a bad name, partly due to the cultural implications of the first definition. Both [malware](computers-cysec-malware.md) and [social engineering](social-engineering.md) can serve to completely destroy society by some of the most intelligent and immoral individuals, and the large-scale [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) (often advanced *by* the hackers themselves) means most people are typically uneducated about the positive side of that brilliance.

More broadly, hacking simply means using something outside of its creator's intended purpose (e.g., using an oven as a space heater). As a term, hacking usually implies computer crimes, but has positive associations within modern vernacular beyond computers (e.g., "life hacks").

## Deviant

Whether intentional or not, a hacker will invariably defy [social convention](culture.md). They use errors, glitches, and hidden-away features to accomplish a specific purpose, which requires an inherent sense of lateral thinking.

As a result, [neurodivergent](mind-neurodivergence.md) people (such as [autism](https://books2read.com/autism/), ADHD, and schizophrenia) are more gifted at hacking, though a [rebellious attitude](maturity.md) can mimic the same mindset necessary to find hacks.

Often, hacks require "reverse engineering" something, which involves designing something to produce the same output when you don't know how the thing works. Some people are so brilliant their reverse-engineered attempts work *better* than the thing they were imitating!

## Purpose

Hacks can come from a *wide* moral spectrum of motivations, ranging from good ("white hat") to completely unscrupulous or self-interested ("black hat"):

1. Altruism - doing something unconventional to improve the public good.
2. [Fixing](fix.md) - improvise a solution to a legitimate problem.
3. Curiosity - pure wonder or the desire to solve a puzzle.
4. Silliness - it sounded fun to try.
5. Freedom - bypassing social convention to gain more freedoms.
6. Merit - seeking public attention.
7. Vengeance - vigilante justice or revenge against an individual/organization.
8. Power - gaining some type of [power](power-types.md) without earning it, such as money.
9. Destruction - gaining an anonymous reputation from the destruction they've caused.

But, from the public's perspective, there are 3 major classes of hacker:

1. Observe and Exploit - building and destroying with [terminals](computers-cli.md) and [code](programming-basics.md), often includes [PenTesters](computers-cysec-pentest.md).
2. Unconventional [Fixing](fix.md) - typically an [engineering](engineering.md) solution that either transforms mundane objects into clever fixes or fixes problems most people have blindly accepted [habitually](habits.md).
3. New Perspectives - building mind-bending experiences that redefine how we see reality, typically only attainable by a [genius savant](https://books2read.com/autism/).

The following is a collection of the 3 major categories of hack. They are *not* exclusive, but the hope is to show how hacking transcends limits, in *every* direction.

## Observe & exploit

Sometimes, all it takes to hack is to notice some small detail, then use it for some sort of advantage. Or, sometimes, *many* small details.
