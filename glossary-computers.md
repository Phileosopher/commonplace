# Computers glossary

This is *not* an exhaustive glossary, but more a system to keep me accountable to not get too in-the-weeds on technical things.

For a more legitimate tech glossary, several others are better:

- [TechTerms.com](https://techterms.com/)
- [Webopedia](https://www.webopedia.com/)
