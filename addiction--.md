a dry drunk:
- someone who has gone cold turkey on a substance, but they haven't done any work on themselves

how to detect:
1. tries to exert control, then gets angry because what they're trying to control isn't working out the way they wanted
  - i.e., they believe they'll find some closure if they try REALLY hard at something

the 12 steps start incorrectly:
- "My name is X, and I am a substance abuser"
- it is what you DO, but doesn't have to be your [identity]
- if your identity is in Christ, then you are MORE than conquerors
