a dry drunk:
- someone who has gone cold turkey on a substance, but they haven't done any work on themselves

how to detect:
1. tries to exert control, then gets angry because what they're trying to control isn't working out the way they wanted
  - i.e., they believe they'll find some closure if they try REALLY hard at something
