God gives every Christian spiritual gifts, which Christians are personally [responsible](meaning.md) to manage.

Understanding our gifts is a critical component of developing our [Christian identity](identity.md) ([1 Corinthians 12-14](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/12.htm), [Ephesians 4:1-16](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/4.htm), [Romans 12:1-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/12.htm), [1 Peter 4:7-11](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_peter/4.htm)).

The Body of Christ is one unit with many parts, not merely a diverse [group](groups-small.md) that meets together ([1 Corinthians 12:12](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm)).

- *Every* believer is equally essential, and every spiritual gift has its time and place ([Ecclesiastes 3:1-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ecclesiastes/3.htm)).

The Holy Spirit gives us our spiritual gifts ([James 1:17](https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm)).

- Our spiritual gifts come through Christ, *never* ourselves ([John 15:5](https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm)).
- We can't change, improve, or create them apart from [His will](god-will.md) ([1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 11](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/12.htm)).
- We *should* desire useful gifts that build Christ's Body ([1 Corinthians 12:31](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm), [13:5](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-5.htm), [13:12](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm)).

## Classifications

While all gifts come from the Holy Spirit, He's given four context-specific types.

A. Church position gifts:

- Given to the New Testament Church collectively, not individuals ([Ephesians 4:1-18](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/4.htm)).
- They [symbolically](symbols.md) reflect positions Jesus gave to help people grow the Church into a unified Body.

B. Situational gifts

- Given as God sees as appropriate for specific situations ([1 Corinthians 12:7-11](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/12.htm)).
- God freely gives situational gifts when we're fully surrendered to Him and request them in prayer.
- Situational gifts can magnify absolutely *anything* a human can already do, so there's no way to reliably categorize them.

C. Sign gifts

- Given specifically to the Apostles to start the first-century Church ([1 Corinthians 12-14](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/12.htm)).
- Sign gifts are situational gifts, but with *much* more power and scope (the Apostles showed the most authority and power in *all* recorded history).
- God gave sign gifts for two specific reasons:
  1. To demonstrate the Apostles had the same spiritual power as Jesus to prove their discipleship under the risen Christ ([Acts 2:22](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm), [2:43](https://biblehub.com/acts/2-43.htm), [5:12-16](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/5.htm)).
  2. To give authority to demonstrate divine revelation until [God's Scriptures](bible.md) were finished, systematically arranged, and declared absolute ([John 17:13-17](https://biblehub.com/bsb/john/17.htm), [Revelation 22:18-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/revelation/22.htm)).
- Several types of signs proved the Apostles' authenticity:
  1. Sign healing restored limbs and resurrected the dead ([Acts 3:1-10](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/3.htm), [Acts 9:37-40](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/9.htm), [Acts 20:9-12](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/20.htm)).
  2. Sign miracles looked similar to Old Testament miracles, with various powers ranging from protecting a ship's crew to surviving death from a poisonous snake ([Acts 27:31](https://biblehub.com/acts/27-31.htm),[44](https://biblehub.com/acts/27-44.htm), [Acts 28:3-6](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/28.htm)).
  3. Sign revelation was through an Apostle who gave the same authority and accuracy as Scripture ([1 John 4:1-3](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_john/4.htm)).
     - Sign prophecy had so much authority that it became the New Testament ([2 Peter 1:20-21](https://biblehub.com/bsb/2_peter/1.htm)).
     - Sign tongues was the ability to speak in unlearned languages that others knew ([Acts 2:4-11](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/2.htm)).

D. Motivational gifts

- Most references to spiritual gifts among Christians refer to motivational gifts.
- Unlike the other gifts, God gives motivational gifts to every Christian of every age to assist in individual, specially appointed [purposes](purpose.md) ([Romans 12:1-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/12.htm)).
- God designed our motivations from our birth to build up and ultimately [strengthen](power.md) Church members.
- Motivational gifts show the Holy Spirit's continuous, persistent drive through our [personalities](personality.md).
- The gifts usually start with simple [desires](purpose.md), but create supernatural results.

## An example

A group of believers is eating at a table when someone drops an expensive gravy dish. The gravy dish breaks, spills the gravy on the floor, and ruins a new suit.

- SERVING grabs a towel and rushes to clean up the mess.
- RULING/ADMINISTRATION directs someone to get a mop, someone else to get a bucket of hot, soapy water, and a third person to help move the table while explaining the need to get to the spots on the floor.
- EXHORTATION/ENCOURAGEMENT informs the person how we all have accidents, how they all know he didn't mean to drop it, then shares how God will make it work for the best ([Romans 8:28](https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm)).
- PROPHECY/DECLARATION will share how man is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly upward ([Job 5:7](https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm)).

## Downsides

God built motivational gifts into a person's [spirit](humanity-christian.md).

- Non-believers can still demonstrate some of those traits (a bit like moving a corpse) when provoked by human goodness, but the Holy Spirit activates them when people [come to Christ](jesus-gospel.md).
- People develop motivational gifts through the Holy Spirit's power, which comes from spiritual maturity in [daily living](spiritual-exercises.md).

Motivational gifts are driven by our [decisions](decisions.md), which create the unfortunate result that believers are capable of directing their gifts *away* from [God's guidance](god-will.md) and toward selfish ambitions.

- When they're directed incorrectly, motivational can cause *tremendous* damage to the Church.

Misused teaching can make someone an intellectual snob:

- Desiring study and knowledge can become intellectual or doctrinal pride.
- Knowing God's Word can create a critical attitude to generally unteachable or less intelligent people.
- The desire to know things in-depth can become an obsession with unimportant Scriptural details with little practical value.
- Knowledge of Scripture can start useless arguments ([2 Timothy 2:23](https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm)).

Misused prophecy/declaration can make someone a jerk:

- Revelations can bluntly hurt others without love.
- Can become self-righteous by clarifying evil to others while overlooking personal shortcomings.
- The desire to see sin judged can lead to them assuming that role instead of God ([Psalm 50:6](https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-6.htm)).
- The desire for things to be either right or wrong can blind them to other relevant factors, circumstances, or motivations.

Misused exhortation/encouragement can make someone a flake:

- While avoiding potentially discouraging things, they may refuse to confront others' failings or apparent sins.
- The power to develop others can also manipulate, control, discourage, or guide others into a dependent relationship.
- Their advisor role can use others' privileged information unwisely or maliciously.
- The desire to give constructive counsel can motivate giving unsolicited advice that harms their reputation or causes division.

Misused serving can make someone a guilt-tripper:

- Their self-perceived selflessness can create a martyr or self-pitying attitude.
- Their desire to serve might get them tangled with responsibilities or situations they have no authority or permission to operate in.
- They may see others that don't observe or act on service opportunities as uncaring or lazy.
- They might overlook others' deeper spiritual or emotional needs in trying to meet physical needs.

Misused giving can make someone a power-monger:

- They might try to control or abuse power with their ability to finance.
- Their pride might look for recognition in giving and will lose their reward with God ([Matthew 6:5](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm)).
- They might become bitter at people that consistently ask for money instead of joyfully handling the inevitable result of their gift.
- Their material blessings from God may sway them to greed, attachment to material things or wasteful living.

Misused mercy can make someone a sucker:

- Their sensitive spirit that creates their gift might quickly turn into constant hurt feelings, frequent crying and hypersensitive frailty.
- The desire to show mercy can blur the need to hold others accountable, give appropriate discipline or practice tough love.
- They might become bitter at perceived insensitivity in others, especially from prophecy or ruling/administration.
- Their desire to help others in need can make them gullible to anyone with a sad story against wise counsel, no matter how phony or exploitative.

Misused ruling/administration can make someone a bureaucrat:

- They may abuse their ability to see the many necessary details of a task to inspire resistance to all plans with unpredictable results or solutions, even God's.
- They might prioritize order or efficiency more important than people or their needs.
- They could become bitter at others with motivations that add unpredictable elements to systems.
- Their need for clear project ends might make them unwilling to work in long-term efforts with unclear end-points.

Misused faith can make someone a reckless fool:

- The desire to trust God for giant things might inspire foolish plans that presume God's provision and dishonor Him.
- The desire for faith can inspire an unwise course against all counsel to prove their faith.
- Their ability to see a great idea's completed vision or dream can create destructive ignorance about practical obstacles.
- Their ability to motivate others to believe in a dream can exploit people when hard, concrete facts make the idea impossible.

## Your spiritual journey will unveil your gifts

There are [spiritual motivational gifts inventories](/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Spiritual-Motivational-Gifts-Inventory.pdf), but it's not reasonable to assume that the Bible describes the *only* spiritual gifts a person may have.

- It's entirely possible God may give spiritual gifts to people as they require, without any precedent or classification.
- For example, Samson technically had a spiritual gift of "physical strength" ([Judges 13-16](https://biblehub.com/bsb/judges/13.htm)) and Solomon was technically gifted with "wisdom".
- If you simply keep showing up to [fulfill needs](church-serve.md) as God leads, you'll discover them without trying.

Pay close attention to the [good habits](habits.md) you keep practicing:

- You'll be thinking and acting on a motivation most of the time, even without anyone expecting you to or seeing any [results](mind-creativity-results.md) from it.
- You're able to work on a specific sort of task for a *very* long time with little to no fatigue.
- Mature Christians are stunned or amazed at what you were capable of doing with those tasks.

More walking with God will create a feedback loop of more desire to exercise that motivation and more apparent results.

## God has a reason for spiritual gifts

[Love](people-love.md) should be the *only* motivation for any of the gifts ([1 Corinthians 12:7](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm), [12:31-13:3](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/12.htm)).

- Christian love is to concern yourself for someone else's well-being more than yours ([1 Corinthians 13:3-7](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm)).
- Genuine love requires freedom from [unconfessed sin](morality-sins.md), being filled with the Holy Spirit, and openness for God to use your motivational gifts ([1 Thessalonians 5:19-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_thessalonians/5.htm)).
- God has created all the spiritual gifts, uses all of them, and should always receive praise from their use ([Colossians 1:15-18](https://biblehub.com/bsb/colossians/1.htm)).

The whole purpose of spiritual gifts is to benefit the [Body of Christ](church.md) as a whole ([1 Corinthians 12:12-20](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/12.htm), [Ephesians 4:16](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm)).

- Assuming people use them correctly, every church has *more* than enough gifts to do what God wants ([1 Corinthians 1:4-7](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/1.htm), [Ephesians 4:7-13](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/4.htm)).

Boldly use your gifts with authority.

- God will clarify if you've behaved wrongly ([Romans 12:6-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/romans/12.htm)).
- As you mature in Christ, your spiritual gifts will grow along with more and better gifts ([1 Corinthians 13:11-13](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/13.htm), [1 Corinthians 14:20-21](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/14.htm), [Ephesians 4:14-15](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/4.htm)).
- Using our spiritual gifts is time-critical in our [present age](jesus-returns.md) ([1 Peter 4:7-11](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_peter/4.htm)).
