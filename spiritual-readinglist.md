[The Bible](bible.md) was not created in a vacuum. It was built over millennia by God's direct inspiration to people who had lived in those times.

While it's *not* a requirement to understand more about the Bible for the sake of [salvation](jesus-gospel.md) or [serving](church-serve.md), we are responsible to sharpen our [understanding](understanding.md) to the degree we're gifted with brainpower. If for nothing else, it keeps smart people out of trouble.

[For ethical reasons](https://theologos.site/ip/), I aim for public domain works as much as possible.
