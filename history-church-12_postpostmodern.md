# The summarized history of the Christian church 12: The Protestant Post-Post-Modernism

The **World Assemblies of God Fellowship** arose in 1989 as a cooperative of over 170 Pentecostal denominations, though it had existed on a much smaller scale since 1914. It served to give more connection and collaboration across the groups, given their [cultural differences](people-culture.md) and shared [theology](theology.md).

The **New Apostolic Movement** spun off the Charismatic movements and was coined in 1996, which indicate that there are new Apostles that God appoints as an authority to run the Church. From one angle, their values could be considered a [cult](culture-cults.md).

The Neo-charismatic Movement started in the early 1980s with groups like the Vineyard Movement that deviated from Calvary Chapel, and vastly expanded the scope of Charismatic spirituality.

- Among other things, "third-wave Pentecostalism" promoted all varieties of miraculous healing (including as an [evangelistic](evangelism.md) technique), *heavy* emphasis on [spiritual warfare](spiritual-warfare.md), and other odd phenomena of the Holy Spirit such as "spiritual laughter".
- Organizationally, they often have little to no formal structure to their meetings whatsoever or any cohesive hierarchy, and their [theology](theology.md) tends to be anti-intellectual.

The **Hebrew Roots Movement/Awakening** emerged in 1997 when Dean Cozzens of Open Church Ministries indicated that returning to living according to the Torah was the final stage of empowerment after 3 other movements: the Pentecostal movement, faith healing, and the Charismatic movement. The movement implies the Torah is a clear way for all people (Jews *and* Gentiles) to live and follow God, though they typically don't imply it's required for salvation.

The Online Church movement started in 2007 when Life Covenant Church broadcast their church services within the online game Second Life. They renamed themselves **Life.Church** later, and devote their efforts to almost strictly online church attendance. The movement expanded when COVID-19 happened in 2020 and everyone worldwide was forced to stay indoors.

More to come, since I'm writing this February 2023.

At some point, [Jesus will come back](jesus-returns.md), and will [establish His Kingdom](https://theologos.site/millennium/). Most of the denominations won't historically survive the transition.
