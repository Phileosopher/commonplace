# The forms of neurodivergence

This is an informal list of the varieties of neurodivergence.

- It's essential to note that deviations from [social standards](people-rules.md) end up forming even more deviations through uniquely different [cultural experiences](people-culture.md), which means these diagnoses rarely exist alone.
- It's also worth noting that awareness of the neurodivergence doesn't necessitate any necessary action: many [personalities](personality.md) have lived amazing lives as extreme neurodivergent minds. The only requirement is to take action when the behavior *from* the mental framework creates severe adverse [consequences](results.md).

Everyone likely possesses at least a *little* of each of these as well, so the classification really has no place for [prejudice](people-discrimination.md).

- Most people see [aberrant behavior](people-rules-list.md) as something dangerous.
- Most of the time, there is a very specific place for neurodivergence, and an utterly *terrible* place for it as well.
- Often, the needs of a neurodivergent are the same as everyone else's, but in differing quantities.

## Attention deficit disorder (ADD)

A hyperactive focus on many things, often with many connections and associations, but with very little refinement of the thoughts.

- When it's a severe case, it becomes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
- Their mind is generally experiencing racing thoughts, but as a typical part of their daily lives.
- Every symptom of their diagnosis is linked to [dysregulation](awareness-dysregulation.md).

Indicators:

1. Hyperactive
   - Trouble with patiently waiting their turn
   - Excessively talking
   - Speaks very quickly
   - Has no internal language "filter" and over-shares information
2. Impulsive
   - Interjects rapid, emotional answers
   - Rambles or veers off-topic
   - Easily shifts subjects without provocation
   - Fidgets when others are speaking
   - Difficulty staying focused on one task
3. Inattentive
   - Easily bored and distracted by external stimuli or background information
   - Unintentionally loud
   - May unintentionally dominate conversations
   - Forgets details and needs to have information repeated
   - Appears to ignore others

ADD often mixes with [autism](mind-neurodivergence-autism.md).

- The dominant different is the lack of autistic hyperfocus, which draws in associations from *everything* toward a singular task (e.g., everything is about Star Wars).

How to behave with them:

- Give them room to run their mind all over the place.
- Don't expect them to be reliable.
- If you're patient, you can often train them to be more socially acceptable:
  - Openly state when they've interrupted you.
  - If they ever indicate two unrelated domains, ask them how they are related.

The cure for it:

- They need an outlet to run out their mind on an activity, which is typically a [creative endeavor](mind-creativity-how.md) but can sometimes be through physical exertion.

## Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

I have enough information on this that [it merits a separate section](mind-neurodivergence-autism.md).

## Bipolar personality disorder (BPD)

A fractured emotional state, represented by a hyperactive mode ("mania") and a low-energy mode ("depressive").

- The vacillations alternate at different points, and there's not always a reason for the shift.
- In some ways, it's the representation of two [personalities](personality.md).

Indicators:

- When in the depressive state, a tendency to over-dramatize or be extremely depressed.
- General emotional unawareness of their alternate emotional persona.

How to behave with them:

- Respect their inconsistency as a part of them, and avoid giving them anything that requires them to be evenly reliable.
  - If you want, you can often find a baseline by tracking their initiative in their depressive state, and their accuracy in their manic state.

The cure for it:

- There really is no cure for it, except behavior modification for inappropriate actions.

## Intelligence

A capacity to think far faster than most people.

- May be localized to a specialization, or may be near-universal.
- Can be measured reliably with IQ tests, but high IQ doesn't guarantee wisdom or effectiveness with that intelligence.

Indicators:

- Quicker ability to come to large conclusions, slower ability to react to baser triggers.
- An unusually strong understanding of complex things.

How to behave with them:

- Avoid small talk, since it will bore them.
  - If they exhaust you, politely limit your time with them.
- They have more interest and patience with complex matters, so even "dumb" things will be made complex with them.
- The greatest sense of [meaning](meaning.md) they'll receive will come through your acknowledgment of something new you hadn't learned from them.
  - However, don't take offense if they find your discovery annoying, since they often build cumulative information over concepts that often aren't part of the public dialogue.

The cure for it:

- Socialization is still a requirement, but becomes progressively more difficult in proportion to their intelligence (since most people simply can't think on that level of depth).
- Without socialization, they will often descend into other forms of neurodivergence.

## Narcissism

This one is ubiquitous and complex enough that [it merits a separate section](mind-neurodivergence-clusterb-narcissist.md).

## Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD)

An antagonism against any authority figures.

- Tends to oppose anything [standardized](standards.md) or "institutionalized".
- Often participates in anti-institution institutions (e.g., punk culture, hippies, hacker culture).
- Often simply a product of lower-than-average agreeableness.

How to behave with them:

- Even when hypocritical, respect their views.
- Avoid behaving like an institutional or authority figure.

The cure for it:

- It typically expresses in adolescence and represents as a [phase of maturation](maturity.md).
- However, if the anti-establishment mindset is still present into their 30s, it likely represents their [personality](personality.md).

## Cluster A/Schizophrenia

A viewpoint that is overcrowded with [imagination](imagination.md), to the point of hallucinations and [identity](identity.md) issues.

- Many modes of thought and perspective assembled, but not synthesized into the demarcation between "reality" and "imagination".
- Typically a sign of extreme intelligence, especially visual processing aptitude.
- At a farther extreme, their ability to self-identify is impeded, and they may have a mistaken sense of self relative to reality.

Indicators:

- Clear signs of intelligence, often with the ability to make remarkable associations via [symbolic connection](symbols.md).
- The obsession with symbolic connections impedes their [sense of humor](humor.md), especially puns.

How to behave with them:

- Respect their views, since they often have endless [conflicts in their mind](people-conflicts-inner.md) without you adding your input.
- Don't make any sudden movements or impulsive actions around them, especially if they have ever experienced [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) in their past.

The cure for it:

- They are often absurdly capable of drawing connections, so their occupation should require more [creativity](mind-creativity.md) than most people may be able to perform.
- The only risks are contained in *what* forms of thought and perspective they maintain, so the best solution is to build a relationship with them to allow yourself to clarify to them when they are in error.

## Synaesthesia and altered perceptual states

An altered state of incoming perception, where information doesn't align with typical associations.

- It can be through crossed perceptual states ("synaesthesia") or the absence of perceptual states from an early enough developmental age that frames the world in a different context (e.g., blindness from birth)

Indicators:

- A clear absence of direct associations that others may possess.

How to behave with them:

- Give credit to their views, since the atypical nature of their perception can provide tremendous [meaning](meaning.md) to humanity (e.g., Helen Keller).

The cure for it:

- Beyond assisting them to exist in society (e.g., ADA accommodations), there is no need to do anything.

## Tourettes syndrome

A mental state of deriving tremendous [meaning](meaning.md) out of information that has not been connected with [language](language.md).

Indicators:

- A buildup of sentiment that eventually represents as severe and inaccurate expression to their intended purpose (e.g., profanity, screaming).
- One natural side effect is that they always have some amount of ADHD.

How to behave with them:

- Permit them to speak, and try [actively listening](language-speaking.md) to them.

The cure for it:

- They need to find healthier connections, which requires more thoughtfulness, often through [meditation](awareness-meditation.md).
