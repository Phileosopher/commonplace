# The forms of neurodivergence

This is an informal list of the varieties of neurodivergence.

- It's essential to note that deviations from [social standards](people-rules.md) end up forming even more deviations through uniquely different [cultural experiences](people-culture.md), which means these diagnoses rarely exist alone.
- It's also worth noting that awareness of the neurodivergence doesn't necessitate any necessary action: many [personalities](personality.md) have lived amazing lives as extreme neurodivergent minds. The only requirement is to take action when the behavior *from* the mental framework creates severe adverse [consequences](results.md).

Everyone likely possesses at least a *little* of each of these as well, so the classification really has no place for [prejudice](people-discrimination.md).

## Attention deficit disorder (ADD)

A hyperactive focus on many things, often with many connections and associations, but with very little refinement of the thoughts.

- When it's a severe case, it becomes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
- Their mind is generally experiencing racing thoughts, but as a typical part of their daily lives.
- Every symptom of their diagnosis is linked to [dysregulation](awareness-dysregulation.md).

Indicators:

- Easily shifts subjects without any provocation.
- Difficulty staying focused on one task.
  - However, this is not true when mixed with autism, where the hyperfocus draws in associations from *everything* toward a singular task.

How to behave with them:

- Give them room to run their mind all over the place.
- Don't expect them to be reliable.

The cure for it:

- They need an outlet to run out their mind on an activity, which is typically a [creative endeavor](mind-creativity-how.md) but can sometimes be through physical exertion.

## Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

A granular perspective, drawing stories from the bottom-up instead of the natural top-down view.

- Represented as a broad spectrum, ranging from high-functioning (aka "Asperger's symdrome") all the way down to nonverbal.
- Typically unable to see the "big picture" of things (i.e., "can't see the forest from the trees")
- Likely caused by *very* early childhood [PTSD](hardship-ptsd.md) before [language](language.md) could be implemented to make sense of their severe [feelings](mind-feelings.md) and sensations.

Indicators:

- Poor body language and expression (though capable of processing the information they experience).
- A general hyperfixation on specific subjects, lack of interest in other related subjects.
- General focus on [understanding](understanding.md) to the point of complete [certainty](understanding-certainty.md), often over-certain regarding [unknown things](unknown.md).
- Context-sensitive indicators:
  - Tendency to stare too much
  - Oblivious to personal space or implied messaging (e.g., not noticing you're signaling that you're leaving soon)
- As they age, harder to diagnose as they develop better masking skills.

How to behave with them:

- Take your time and spell things out, give as many details as they'd like
- Don't rush them, and communicate as early as possible about *any* [changes](people-changes.md)

The cure for it:

- There is no cure, as it is a neurological state of existence.
- However, socialization is critical, which can only safely happen within a community that can love and validate them.
- Even without socialization, they can often find tremendous [meaning](meaning.md) through working within their preferred specializations.

## Bipolar personality disorder (BPD)

A fractured emotional state, represented by a hyperactive mode ("mania") and a low-energy mode ("depressive").

- The vacillations alternate at different points, and there's not always a reason for the shift.
- In some ways, it's the representation of two [personalities](personality.md).

Indicators:

- When in the depressive state, a tendency to over-dramatize or be extremely depressed.
- General emotional unawareness of their alternate emotional persona.

How to behave with them:

- Respect their inconsistency as a part of them, and avoid giving them anything that requires them to be evenly reliable.
  - If you want, you can often find a baseline by tracking their initiative in their depressive state, and their accuracy in their manic state.

The cure for it:

- There really is no cure for it, except behavior modification for inappropriate actions.

## Intelligence

A capacity to think far faster than most people.

- May be localized to a specialization, or may be near-universal.
- Can be measured reliably with IQ tests, but high IQ doesn't guarantee wisdom or effectiveness with that intelligence.

Indicators:

- Quicker ability to come to large conclusions, slower ability to react to baser triggers.
- An unusually strong understanding of complex things.

How to behave with them:

- Avoid small talk, since it will bore them.
  - If they exhaust you, politely limit your time with them.
- They have more interest and patience with complex matters, so even "dumb" things will be made complex with them.
- The greatest sense of [meaning](meaning.md) they'll receive will come through your acknowledgment of something new you hadn't learned from them.
  - However, don't take offense if they find your discovery annoying, since they often build cumulative information over concepts that often aren't part of the public dialogue.

The cure for it:

- Socialization is still a requirement, but becomes progressively more difficult in proportion to their intelligence (since most people simply can't think on that level of depth).

## Narcissism

A perspective that represents a dualistic paradox:

1. They have a completely worthless sense of self-worth, to the point of feeling deeply unloved and unfulfilled.
2. They refuse to acknowledge the worthlessness, so they develop an entitlement mindset that implies they deserve much more substantial treatment than they're receiving.

This viewpoint may be a psychological coping mechanism ("narcissistic behavior") or may be a core part of their personality ("narcissistic personality disorder").

- The scope of the narcissism is closely connected with how strongly their self-directed feelings impede their ability to have sympathy for others' feelings.
- While it may express during early childhood, it represents itself when selfishness starts surpassing a desire for others' benefit.
- There are also derivations of this mechanism in the forms of the sociopathy/psychopathy spectrum.

Narcissism has two major forms and some sub-forms:

- Overt/extroverted narcissism is a public image of grandiosity and magnanimity, with a feeling of emptiness that represents as rage and resentment when they don't get what they want.
  - Antagonistic narcissism focuses more on rivalry and competition.
  - Communal narcissism focuses on drawing people together over moral outrage, even while oblivious to their own shortcomings in that domain.
- Covert/introverted narcissism is a public image of shame and self-hatred, but there is a feeling of entitlement they secretly believe they deserve.
  - Malignant narcissism captures more antisocial behaviors such as sadism, revenge, aggression, and paranoia.

Indicators:

- Direct boredom at others' interests, thoughts, or feelings that don't involve them.
- Continuous preoccupation with getting others to attend to them, pay attention to them, spend time with them, etc. ("narcissistic supply")
  - The core goal is for them to see you react to them in some way, which gives them validation that they have made a difference in something.
- Unwillingness to admit complete fault in any error.
  - This creates the side effect that they simply never learn from their mistakes.
- Context-sensitive indicators:
  - Since the world hasn't given them what they want for a long time, and they have tremendous [anger](mind-feelings-anger.md) over it.
    - This will give them an unwavering crease in the center of their forehead.
    - Their qualities become worse as they lose the ability to manipulate people (first physically as they age, then mentally/emotionally)
  - Higher likelihood of fake smiles or no smiles at all.
  - Many of them use [lying](people-lying.md) to maintain their state of mind and lifestyle, often to the point of compulsive lying.
  - They will tend to move [conflicts](people-5_conflicts.md) from simple disagreement to arguments *much* faster than most other people.
- If you're close to one:
  - They will often blame you for their faults ("projection").
  - They will often use other people against you ("triangulation").

How to behave with them:

- Generally, they will only use you, so don't consider any long-term friendship or partnership with them.
- Given their inability to admit fault, there are many ways to exit the conversation with them:
  - Ask them what their greatest regret is, their insecurities, or their weaknesses.
  - Ask them why they feel they have the right to something.
  - Call them out on a lie they've made, then tell them you don't care if they try to justify it.
  - However, any of the above will make them look to exact revenge on you at some point.
  - The better approach is to be as boring as possible with them until they get bored and go somewhere else ("gray-rocking").
- Don't bother arguing with them.
  - Most people argue to prove a point, but narcissists are simply trying to maintain their supply.
  - Ask them why they are so uncomfortable with having a different perspective.
  - The quickest way to defuse every conflict, however, is to say "I accept that's how you feel".
- Be careful when [trusting](trust.md) them, and only give them information you're satisfied with them misusing.

The cure for it:

- The direct solution requires several stages:
  1. Accept they are loved by God.
  2. Act lovingly toward others who need it.
  3. Recognize others' feelings as having equal validity to their own.
- Since this is a self-discovery, they may need to experience tremendous [hardship](hardship.md) by their own doing to come to their realization.
  - You must take care of yourself, so learn to isolate from their toxic behaviors and build relationships with others elsewhere.

## Schizophrenia

A viewpoint that is overcrowded with [imagination](imagination.md), to the point of hallucinations and [identity](identity.md) issues.

- Many modes of thought and perspective assembled, but not synthesized into the demarcation between "reality" and "imagination".
- Typically a sign of extreme intelligence, especially visual processing aptitude.
- At a farther extreme, their ability to self-identify is impeded, and they may have a mistaken sense of self relative to reality.

Indicators:

- Clear signs of intelligence, often with the ability to make remarkable associations via [symbolic connection](symbols.md).
- The obsession with symbolic connections impedes their [sense of humor](humor.md), especially puns.

How to behave with them:

- Respect their views, since they often have endless [conflicts in their mind](conflicts-inner.md) without you adding your input.
- Don't make any sudden movements or impulsive actions around them, especially if they have ever experienced [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) in their past.

The cure for it:

- They are often absurdly capable of drawing connections, so their occupation should require more [creativity](mind-creativity.md) than most people may be able to perform.
- The only risks are contained in *what* forms of thought and perspective they maintain, so the best solution is to build a relationship with them to allow yourself to clarify to them when they are in error.

## Synaesthesia and altered perceptual states

An altered state of incoming perception, where information doesn't align with typical associations.

- It can be through crossed perceptual states ("synaesthesia") or the absence of perceptual states from an early enough developmental age that frames the world in a different context (e.g., blindness from birth)

Indicators:

- A clear absence of direct associations that others may possess.

How to behave with them:

- Give credit to their views, since the atypical nature of their perception can provide tremendous [meaning](meaning.md) to humanity (e.g., Helen Keller).

The cure for it:

- Beyond assisting them to exist in society (e.g., ADA accommodations), there is no need to do anything.

## Tourettes syndrome

A mental state of deriving tremendous [meaning](meaning.md) out of information that has not been connected with [language](language.md).

Indicators:

- A buildup of sentiment that eventually represents as severe and inaccurate expression to their intended purpose (e.g., profanity, screaming).
- One natural side effect is that they always have some amount of ADHD.

How to behave with them:

- Permit them to speak, and try [actively listening](language-speaking.md) to them.

The cure for it:

- They need to find healthier connections, which requires more thoughtfulness, often through [meditation](awareness-meditation.md).
