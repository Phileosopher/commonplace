# Tea

Tea should always taste excellent, and will only taste disgusting for several possible reasons:

- The water to steep it was lukewarm instead of hot.
- The water was so hot it burned the tea.
- The tea was low-quality.
- The tea steeped for too long.

Most fast food restaurants and convenience stores steep low-quality tea too hot for too long.

So-called tea drink mixes and carbonated tea drinks are tea-flavored, but barely resemble tea.

## Tea is good for you

Tea has many health benefits:

- Removes toxins from the bloodstream
- Prevents clogged arteries as a blood thinner
- Helps the circulatory system from increasing blood flow
- Protects lungs from cigarette smoke damage
- Expands the airways to help asthmatics
- Strengthens the immune system
- Lowers cholesterol levels
- Helps with weight loss
- Keeps blood sugar levels in line
- Stimulates relaxation

Tea also decreases the risk of some diseases:

- Various cancers
- Stroke
- Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases
- Tooth decay
- Infections and inflammation

Compared to [coffee](fun-coffee.md), tea has about 1/4 the caffeine and won't stain teeth nearly as much.

## Types of teas

Tea has over 1,500 varieties worldwide.

Excluding herbal tea, all tea comes from the tea plant Camellia Sinensis:

- Black: taken from the tea plant after the leaves have turned black
- Pu-erh: fermented black leaves
- Oolong: taken from the plant halfway between black and green tea
- Green: taken from the plant while the leaves are green
- White: made from tea plant buds

Herbal tea includes everything else and is usually other plants' leaves or flowers (e.g., chamomile, cinnamon, mint, lavender).

## Find good tea

Grocery stores typically have low-quality tea.

Don't buy teabags.

- They're tea plant leftovers and impede the steeping process.

Shop online for tea to get the best price and variety.

- Sample before stocking up if you can't try before buying.

Look for high-quality tea shops:

- The tea display is larger than the pastry display.
- The tea is stored in airtight, opaque containers under subdued lighting.
  - Don't get tea stored in fancy non-airtight containers directly under lights.
- The staff is knowledgeable about teas.
- It's a tasteful, relaxed atmosphere without too many distractions.
- Several dozen tea varieties.
- A wide variety of practical, not fanciful, tea accessories.

## Get everything together

Use oxygenated water:

- Use freshly drawn tap water or filtered tap water.
- Bottled water has a plastic flavor and very little oxygen.
- Distilled, boiling or boiled water doesn't have minerals that capture oxygen particles.

Get a heating element:

- Electric water kettles are quicker than a stove top or microwave to heat water.
- If you're microwaving pure water, set a toothpick in it or it'll overheat instead of boil.

Use a good teapot:

- A teapot is both the brewing chamber and prevents the tea from cooling.
  - You can use glass measuring cups or anything else, but a dedicated teapot adds to the [ritual](/habits/).
  - Cast-iron teapots are often expensive, but they can absorb and retain plenty of heat.
  - Ceramic and porcelain are usually cheaper than iron and transfer heat very slowly.
- A decent teapot comes with an infuser.
  - An infuser is a small basket-shaped filter designed to sit inside the teapot.
  - Don't use the infuser during steeping, but keep it as a strainer.

Get a teacup:

- Ceramic cups keep the tea hot the longest.
- Small cups are quaint, but they're typically too small for most people.

## How to brew good tea

A. Start heating water:

- The tea leaves will soak up some water, so put in a little more water than you expect you'll want.

B. Preheat the teapot and wait for the water to boil:

- Fill with hot tap water to avoid losing heat later.

C. Pour the water out of the teapot when it's hot enough:

- Green: when you first see bubbles
- White: shortly before it comes to a boil
- Black, Oolong & Herbal: right after it starts boiling
- If you prefer, blot with a paper towel.

D. Add tea to the teapot:

- Use a real measuring spoon, don't guess.
- Add about 1 teaspoon for every 8 ounces of water.
  - The measurement is called a teaspoon for this reason.
  - Add 1.5 teaspoons for every 8 ounces of white tea.
- Add extra for stronger tea and experiment to find your preference.

E. Add the water back in and steep:

- The longer your tea steeps, the bitterer and stronger it becomes.
  - Green: 1--3 minutes
  - Oolong: 1--9 minutes
  - Black: 3--5 minutes
  - Herbal: 5--7 minutes
  - White: 4--15 minutes
- Tea needs room to spread out.
  - The water needs to circulate through the leaves.
  - Infusers and tea bags impede the steeping process.
- Herbal tea needs at least 5 minutes, but extra steeping doesn't make it bitterer or stronger.

F. Run hot water into the teacup to prepare it:

- Discard the water by pouring it through the infuser over the sink.

G. Pour the tea and drink:

- Pour your tea into a cup through the infuser or a mesh filter.
- Add extra flavor with a cinnamon stick as a stirrer.

H. Cleanup tea leaves usefully by composting them or sending through the garbage disposal.
