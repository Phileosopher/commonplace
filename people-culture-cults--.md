New thought movement:
Law of attraction
Christ conaciouaness
Metaphyaical Christianity, in otger words
It's about "unity" and adopts panentheism thwt ppl are NOT separate from God

the idea of a cult is difficult because it's a new word

more than anything, it is a (religion) where the leadership is so (influential) that they can persuade the members to follow irrational beliefs out of (trust) in the leaders' assertions

NOTE: PULL SOME TO RELIGION, MOVE TO RELIGION-CULTS.MD?

in general, a cult is a culture that practices things that would generally be (taboo) or (abusive)

a cult, however, is only a higher concentration of (power) misuse: power (abuse) can happen anywhere
