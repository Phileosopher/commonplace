A functional programming language, such as Erlang or Haskell, much of
what you've previously learned about programming languages will just get
in the way. They aren't similar to traditional procedural languages in
any way that's helpful.

## 0 Languages To Address

NOTE: these langs must be addressed within the trendless.tech/langs page

MUST:
BASIC
C
C++
COBOL

MAYBE:
Perl
    was designed for writing reports

PROBABLY NOT:

## cobol

The preferred language of financial transactions is COBOL

- it's REALLY REALLY fast

## datalog

## js - web dev

freeCodeCamp dev quiz - Web Dev - JS

- Specific JS web things
    - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation which is a text-based format to store and exchange data.
    - The DOM is a programming interface to create, change, or remove elements from the document.
- It's important to distinguish between client-side and server-side JS
    - client-side is inside

## ocaml

The preferred language of investors is OCamL

- First, Ocaml's design requires programmers to be very explicit about what data they're using and what they're trying to do with it. Excel is happy to tell you that the square root of today's date is 2:22pm on July 29th, 1900; Ocaml will insist that you figure out what you _meant_ to take the square root of first. This has the obvious advantage that it spots certain kinds of bugs before code goes live; it simply won't work if you make certain categories of mistakes, even if what you're doing just consists of known mathematical operations on numbers. It won't catch every bug, of course, but this is helpful.
- More subtly, this system makes it easier to reason about complex systems, since it's easier to see what code is executing when, and what it's trying to accomplish. Complex systems generate edge cases, and in trading edge cases generate bankruptcies. The more a trading system resembles a theorem instead of a recipe, the easier it will be. And code that explicitly declares types also has a form of documentation that's automatically audited by the compiler-you can predict often that the code will do what it says because if it doesn't do that, it won't do anything.

## ruby

From a comment

- Ruby is beautiful. The seamless blend of OO, functional, and imperative programming is beautiful. It can be dense without being obscure. irb and pry make it easy to explore code and data. The syntax is mostly conventional and easy to learn. The standard libraries are well designed, and have consistent interfaces. The documentation is concise and easy to scan. I won't say its "The Best", but of the dynamic, interpreted languages I know, Ruby is the most fun to use, and it starts with the clean, well-considered design right at its core.

## automation

Suppose you wanted to automate code review scheduling and approval. You might put a special marker in each source code file:
/* Status: needs_review */
A simple script could go through all of the source code and look for all files that had a status of needs_review, indicating that they were ready to be reviewed. You could then post a list of those files as a Web page, automatically send e-mail to the appropriate people,

Letting the (automated) wizards have their way leaves your knowledge shallow and leaves you limited to what the wizards can already do for you.

## avoid manual procedures

Don't Use Manual Procedures:
People just aren't as repeatable as computers are. Nor should we expect them to be. A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time.

## built-in debugging

Every module can have its own unit test built into its code, and these tests can be performed automatically as part of the regular build process.

Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system.

What sorts of things might you choose to investigate with a prototype? Anything that carries risk. Anything that hasn't been tried before, or that is absolutely critical to the final system. Anything unproven, experimental, or doubtful. Anything you aren't comfortable with. Its value lies not in the code produced, but in the lessons learned.

## changing objects

If you need to change an object's state, get the object to do it for you.

## common mistakes

Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up.

Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it's the only one you have.

## deliberate programming

Program deliberately:
Don't code blindfolded. Attempting to build an application you don't fully understand, or to use a technology you aren't familiar with, is an invitation to be misled by coincidences.
Proceed from a plan.
Document your assumptions.
Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don't guess; actually try it. Write an assertion to test your assumptions

Are there dusty corners of your primary programming language that you rarely visit?
- Regular expressions are extremely powerful and tragically underutilized.
- Multithreaded programming
- stream libraries
- network programming APIs
- utilities available for dealing with collections or lists?

The more successful you are, the more likely you are to make a fatal mistake. When you've got everything going for you, you're less likely to question your own judgment. When the way you've always done it has always worked, you're less likely to recognize a new way that might work better.

Every wrong note is at most one step away from a right one. What makes improvisations bad is when the improviser doesn't know what to do when the wrong note pops out.

"I don't know" is not a phrase for the insecure.

Heroes never panic.

## design by contract

The concept of Design by Contract: What is a correct program? One that does no more and no less than it claims to do. Documenting and verifying that claim is the heart of Design by Contract

Be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in return. Remember, if your contract indicates that you'll accept anything and promise the world in return, then you've got a lot of code to write!

## focusing on the problem

Program Close to the Problem domain: By coding at a higher level of abstraction, you are free to concentrate on solving domain problems, and can ignore petty implementation details.

## global vs local

Avoid global data. Explicitly pass any required context into your modules.

## human-readable code

While the code for parsing a "real" language may be harder to write, it will be much easier for people to understand, and to extend in the future with new features.

The units you use make a difference in the interpretation of the result. If you say that something will take about 130 working days, then people will be expecting it to come in pretty close. However, if you say "Oh, about six months," then they know to look for it any time between five and seven months

Human-readable forms of data, and self-describing data, will outlive all other forms of data and the applications that created them.

In explaining the problem to another person you must explicitly state things that you may take for granted when going through the code yourself. By having to verbalize some of these assumptions, you may suddenly gain new insight into the problem.

## keep it small

It is easier to write relatively small, self-contained components than a single large block of code.

If components have specific, well-defined responsibilities, they can be combined with new components in ways that were not envisioned by their original implementors.

If I dramatically change the requirements behind a particular function, how many modules are affected?

## law of demeter

Using The Law of Demeter will make your code more adaptable and robust.

## managing a knowledge portfolio - DRY principle

The DRY principle: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

Duplication we see falls into one of the following categories:
Imposed duplication. Developers feel they have no choice-the environment seems to require duplication.
Inadvertent duplication. Developers don't realize that they are duplicating information.
Impatient duplication. Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easier.
Interdeveloper duplication. Multiple people on a team (or on different teams) duplicate a piece of information.

Sometimes, duplication seems to be forced on us. With a bit of ingenuity you can normally remove the need for duplication. Often the answer is to write a simple filter or code generator. Structures in multiple languages can be built from a common metadata representation using a simple code generator

The trick is to make the process active: this cannot be a one-time conversion, or we're back in a position of duplicating data.

Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets. Unfortunately, they're expiring assets. Your knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, languages, and environments are developed.

Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio: Serious investors invest regularly-as a habit. Diversification is the key to long-term success. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. Buy low, sell high. Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding.

Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut. If you've used only makefiles and an editor, try an IDE, and vice versa.

Keep the low-level knowledge in the code, where it belongs, and reserve the comments for other, high-level explanations.

## modularize

Organize your code into cells (modules) and limit the interaction between them.

## problems with being detail-oriented

No amount of genius can overcome a preoccupation with detail.

"Out with the details!" Get them out of the code. While we're at it, we can make our code highly configurable and "soft"-that is, easily adaptable to changes.

Think declaratively (specifying what is to be done, not how) and create highly dynamic and adaptable programs. We do this by adopting a general rule: program for the general case, and put the specifics somewhere else-outside the compiled code base.

Because business policy and rules are more likely to change than any other aspect of the project, it makes sense to maintain them in a very flexible format.

Rather than construction, software is more like gardening-it is more organic than concrete.

## refactoring

When Should You Refactor? When you come across a stumbling block because the code doesn't quite fit anymore, or you notice two things that should really be merged, or anything else at all strikes you as being "wrong," don't hesitate to change it

Don't try to refactor and add functionality at the same time.

## specialized information

One body of knowledge is neither technical nor domain-specific and won't be outdated at any time soon: the basics of business finance.

## the software developer

Software developers are typically creative, freedom-loving people.

## users' and managers' expectations

The success of a project is measured by how well it meets the expectations of its users. A project that falls below their expectations is deemed a failure, no matter how good the deliverable is in absolute terms.

Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations

Some consultants call this process "managing expectations"-actively controlling what users should hope to get from their systems. We think this is a somewhat elitist position. Our role is not to control the hopes of our users. Instead, we need to work with them to come to a common understanding of the development process and the final deliverable, along with those expectations they have not yet verbalized.

If you work closely with your users, sharing their expectations and communicating what you're doing, then there will be few surprises when the project gets delivered. This is a BAD THING. Try to surprise your users. Not scare them, mind you, but delight them. Give them that little bit more than they were expecting. The extra bit of effort it requires to add some user-oriented feature to the system will pay for itself time and time again in goodwill. Listen to your users as the project progresses for clues about what features would really delight them.

He had this uncanny ability to predict what you were going to ask him to do and do it before you thought of it. It was like magic. He was only doing things that I had already said I wanted. I had just said them in ways that were subtle enough that even I didn't realize I had said them.

Mind reading not only applies to your managers but also to your customers. If they're giving you the right cues, you might be able to add features that they're either going to ask for or would have asked for if they had realized they were possible.

Start making some notes about what you think your users and managers are going to ask for. Be creative. Try to see the system from their points of view.

## write code that writes code

Write Code That Writes Code:
There are two main types of code generators: Passive code generators are run once to produce a result. From that point forward, the result becomes freestanding-it is divorced from the code generator.

Active code generators are used each time their results are required. The result is a throw-away-it can always be reproduced by the code generator. Often, active code generators read some form of script or control file to produce their results.

It is simpler to express it in a simpler, language-neutral representation and generate the code for both languages,

## pragmaticprogrammer

Care About Your Craft: Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?
Think! About Your Work: Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.
Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses: Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done.
Don't Live with Broken Windows: Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.
Be a Catalyst for Change: You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.
Remember the Big Picture: Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you.
Make Quality a Requirements Issue: Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.
Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio: Make learning a habit.
Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear: Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.
It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It: There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them effectively.
DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
Make It Easy to Reuse: If it's easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.
Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things: Design components that are self-contained. independent, and have a single, well-defined purpose.
There Are No Final Decisions: No decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in the sand at the beach, and plan for change.
Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target: Tracer bullets let you home in on your target by trying things and seeing how close they land.
Prototype to Learn: Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.
Program Close to the Problem Domain: Design and code in your user's language.
Estimate to Avoid Surprises: Estimate before you start. You'll spot potential problems up front.
Iterate the Schedule with the Code: Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time scales.
Keep Knowledge in Plain Text: Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing.
Use the Power of Command Shells: Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don't cut it.
Use a Single Editor Well: The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable.
Always Use Source Code Control: Source code control is a time machine for your work – you can go back.
Fix the Problem, Not the Blame: It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's – it is still your problem, and it still needs to be fixed.
Don't Panic When Debugging: Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.
"select" Isn't Broken: It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.
Don't Assume It – Prove It: Prove your assumptions in the actual environment – with real data and boundary conditions.
Learn a Text Manipulation Language: You spend a large part of each day working with text. Why not have the computer do some of it for you?
Write Code That Writes Code: Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.
You Can't Write Perfect Software: Software can't be perfect. Protect your code and users from the inevitable errors.
Design with Contracts: Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.
Crash Early: A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.
Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible: Assertions validate your assumptions. Use them to protect your code from an uncertain world.
Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems: Exceptions can suffer from all the readability and maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code. Reserve exceptions for exceptional things.
Finish What You Start: Where possible, the routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.
Minimize Coupling Between Modules: Avoid coupling by writing "shy" code and applying the Law of Demeter.
Configure, Don't Integrate: Implement technology choices for an application as configuration options, not through integration or engineering.
Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata: Program for the general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.
Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency: Exploit concurrency in your user's workflow.
Design Using Services: Design in terms of services – independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces.
Always Design for Concurrency: Allow for concurrency, and you'll design cleaner interfaces with fewer assumptions.
Separate Views from Models: Gain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of models and views.
Use Blackboards to Coordinate Workflow: Use blackboards to coordinate disparate facts and agents, while maintaining independence and isolation among participants.
Don't Program by Coincidence: Rely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity, and don't confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.
Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms: Get a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.
Test Your Estimates: Mathematical analysis of algorithms doesn't tell you everything. Try timing your code in its target environment.
Refactor Early, Refactor Often: Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.
Design to Test: Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.
Test Your Software, or Your Users Will: Test ruthlessly. Don't make your users find bugs for you.
Don't Use Wizard Code You Don't Understand: Wizards can generate reams of code. Make sure you understand all of it before you incorporate it into your project.
Don't Gather Requirements – Dig for Them: Requirements rarely lie on the surface. They're buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.
Workwith a User to Think Like a User: It's the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be used.
Abstractions Live Longer than Details: Invest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.
Use a Project Glossary: Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and vocabulary for a project.
Don't Think Outside the Box – Find the Box: When faced with an impossible problem, identify the real constraints. Ask yourself: "Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?"
Start When You're Ready.: You've been building experience all your life. Don't ignore niggling doubts.
Some Things Are Better Done than Described: Don't fall into the specification spiral – at some point you need to start coding.
Don't Be a Slave to Formal Methods.: Don't blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and capabilities.
Costly Tools Don't Produce Better Designs: Beware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag. Judge tools on their merits.
Organize Teams Around Functionality: Don't separate designers from coders, testers from data modelers. Build teams the way you build code.
Don't Use Manual Procedures: A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time.
Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically: Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on a shelf.
Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run: 'Nuff said.
Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing: Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify that testing will catch them.
Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage: Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn't enough.
Find Bugs Once: Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.
English is Just a Programming Language: Write documents as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, use metadata, MVC, automatic generation, and so on.
Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On: Documentation created separately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date.
Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations: Come to understand your users' expectations, then deliver just that little bit more.
Sign Your Work: Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too.

The hardest part of learning how to program is _not_ learning how a programming language works: it's learning how to _solve problems_ with code.

freeCodeCamp dev quiz - Prog Basics/Features
- what is encapsulation in coding?
- What is a parallel array?
- What is a high order function?
- What's the difference between a "for" and "while" loop?
- The rules that determine the correct structure of the code in a computer program are known as syntax.
- The value of a const variable in JS must be specified when the varible is declared.
- The sequence of statements in a do..while loop runs at least once because the condition is evaluated after running the statements.
- If functions can be sent and received just like values, than that languge is said to have first class functions. They are also called first class citizens.
- An argument is a value passed to a function (or method) when the function or method is called.
- Object destructuring is used to extract an object's values into new variables.
- A special symbol used to perform arithmetic or logical computations is known as operator.
- The rest operator takes the individual arguments passed to a function and converts them into an array.
- The bind function returns a new function with given arguments as the new function's 'this' keyword. [Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)
- Each one of the alternative sequence of statements in a conditional statement is known as a branch.
- A computer programming language used for inserting, deleting, and updating data in a database is known as a Data Manipulation Language.
- What is a [Data control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_control_language) language?
- The value undefined is returned by functions that do not have a return statement in JS, but returns None in Python.
- The spread operator can be used to copy portions of an array or object into another array or object.

[GitHub - packing-box/awesome-executable-packing: A curated list of awesome resources related to executable packing](https://github.com/packing-box/awesome-executable-packing)
- _Packing_ is the action of modifying an executable in a way that does not modify its purpose. It is generally one or a combination of the following operations:
	- bundling: makes a single executable with multiple files
	- compression: compresses the executable to reduce its original size
	- encoding: obfuscates the executable by encoding it
	- encryption: obfuscates the executable by encrypting it
	- mutation: alters the executable's code so that it uses a modifided instruction set and architecture (e.g. using oligomorphism)
	- protection: makes the reversing of the executable harder (i.e. using anti-debugging, anti-tampering or other tricks)
	- virtualization: embeds a virtual machine that allows to virtualize executable's instructions
