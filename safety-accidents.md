# How to be prepared for various accidents

If you can't jump out of the way of a car about to hit you, jump upwards.

Jumping from a fast-moving vehicle:

- The sudden stop is what kills you, not the jump, so try to find something that will distribute the force, such as something soft.
- Avoid jumping down from a height (like a bridge), since you're adding downward acceleration to your horizontal speed.
- Try to slow your speed as you jump by launching yourself toward the back.
- Ideally, jump with something you can slide on, like a sled, but otherwise aim for landing sideways to do a barrel roll.
- Altogether with a train, it means jumping diagonally backwards from a running start onto a soft surface.

If you're falling from several stories:

1. Look for anything that will break your fall at least a little.
2. Aim for something soft (but *not* water).
3. Try to land on your feet and roll onto your sides while protecting your head.

Aircraft failure:

- Stay in the aircraft if you don't have a parachute.
  - Go to the back of a plane as it's going down to increase your chances of surviving.
  - Cover your head and duck down as much as possible.
- If you're separated from the aircraft:
  - You're traveling at about 120 mph, which is called "terminal velocity".
  - Aim for a soft location to land.
    - Grass, haystacks, swamps, snow, and bushes are ideal.
    - Glass hurts, but breaks your fall.
    - Trees can help, but can also skewer.
    - Hitting a body of water at that speed is about the same as hitting a sidewalk.
  - Spread out your body as much as possible, like a skydiver.
  - If you must hit water, assume a straight-legged vertical position, like a needle, with your butt clenched.
    - Alternately, go face-down, with your hands clasped together and extended to protect your face.

Chairlift accident:

1. Ditch any extra weight like skis or snowboards, but keep your gloves.
2. Pull up onto the cable, first with your hands, then with your feet.
3. Shimmy to the top if you're close, otherwise shimmy down.
4. Go slowly, to avoid exhausting yourself.

Falling elevator:

1. Stack any belongings on the floor and stand on them.
2. Spread your weight across any handrails in the elevator.
3. Slightly bend your knees (don't jump, since it's pointless).

If your car falls into a body of water:

1. Brace for impact and stay buckled, since you don't know what will happen.
   - Make sure you have a blunt object to break the window, in case the circuitry fails.
   - You might be able to use your car seat's headrest, but time will be critical.
2. *Immediately* unbuckle, open the car window, and get out before it goes underwater.
   - You have 30--60 seconds before it reaches the window.
   - The pressure against the car gets exponentially stronger as it goes deeper, so you will probably die if you reach for your cell phone.
   - If you have children, get the oldest children out and carry the smallest one.
3. Once it's underwater, you should be able to open the door, but will need to hold your breath under extreme stress.
4. However, once it's completely submerged, you have a different problem.
   - Don't waste your energy trying to open the door if it won't move.
   - Do *not* open the window, since the rush of water entering the car will prevent you from getting out.
   - By design, the car will generally be front-heavy, meaning the rear window is facing upward, so use the tip of the headrest to break through.

Capsized boat:

1. Use VHF Channel 16 to notify emergency services.
2. Grab any signal devices you can such as flashlights, mirrors, whistles, flares, or retro reflective tape.
3. Strap on a life jacket and make any other flotation devices such as water bottles or tied-up pants.
4. Watch for and avoid cutting any tethers or ropes that could tangle you.
5. Unless you see land you can swim to, stay with the vessel, since it may stay afloat.
6. Huddle with other survivors to maintain body heat.
7. If you have enough flotation devices, try to tie them together to improvise a raft.
8. Avoid ever thrashing, since you might attract sharks.

If your [car](autos.md) is broken down at the side of the road, avoid standing in front of it (in case another vehicle strikes it).
