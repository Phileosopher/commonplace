No one will ever be able to measure nerve impulse speed.
Johannes Muller, physiologist
1846

Although we are living in what may be termed the steam era and our Navy is a steam navy, I have in this work wholly excluded the consideration of steam power, as, owing to the great cost of coal and the impossibility of providing stowage for it except to a limited extent, the application of steam power for ordinary purposes must be strictly auxiliary and subordinate and its employment in general service the exception rather than the rule.
Captain Alston, RN, Manual of Seamanship
1859

Drill for oil? You mean drill into the ground to try and find oil? You’re crazy.
Workers Edwin L. Drake tried to enlist to his project to drill for oil

Sir William Preece, Chief Engineer, British Post Office
1876

This "telephone" has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.
Western Union Co. internal memo

The ordinary 'horseless carriage' is at present a luxury for the wealthy; and although its price will probably fall in the future, it will never, of course, come into as common use as the bicycle.
Literary Digest
1899

I must confess that my imagination, in spite even of spurring, refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocating its crew and foundering at sea. – H. G. Wells, 1901 I confess that in 1901 I said to my brother Orville that man would not fly for fifty years. – Wilbur Wright, 1908 Flight by machines heavier than air is unpractical and insignificant, if not utterly impossible.
Simon Newcomb, Canadian-born American astronomer

Charlie Chaplin

A popular fantasy is to suppose that flying machines could be used to drop dynamite on the enemy in time of war.
William Henry Pickering, Director of Harvard College Observatory
1908

By no possibility can the carriage of freight or passengers through mid-air compete with their carriage on the earth's surface. The field, then, for aerial navigation is limited to military use and for sporting purposes. The former is doubtful, the latter is fairly certain.
Hugh Dryden
1908

That the automobile has reached the limit of its development is suggested by the fact that during the last year no improvements of a radical nature have been introduced.
Scientific American
1909

The (flying) machines will eventually be fast; they will be used in sport but they should not be thought of as commercial carriers.
Octave Chanute
1910

The resistance of air increases as the square of the speed and works as the cube [of speed]...It is clear that with our present devices there is no hope of aircraft competing for racing speed with either our locomotives or automobiles.
William Henry Pickering, Director of Harvard College Observatory
1910

Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value.
Marshall Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy
1911

I can accept the theory of relativity as little as I can accept the existence of atoms and other such dogmas.
Ernst Mach

The aeroplane is the invention of the devil and will never play any part in such a serious business as the defence of a nation.
Sam Hughes, Canadian Minister of Defence
1914

The director of Military Aeronautics of France has decided to discontinue the purchase of monoplanes, their place to be filled entirely with bi-planes.  This decision practically sounds the death knell of the monoplane as a military instrument.

Professor Goddard does not know the relation between action and reaction and the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react. He seems to lack the basic knowledge ladled out in high schools.
New York Times editorial about Robert Goddard's work
1921

Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.
New York Times editorial about Robert Goddard's work
1969

The radio craze will die out in time.
Thomas Edison
1922

Even now perhaps Italy might achieve economic independence by the expenditure of a few million pounds upon research on the lines indicated. I may add in parenthesis that, on thermodynamical grounds which I can hardly summarize shortly, I do not much believe in the commercial possibility of induced radio-activity.
J. B. S. Haldane
1923

So I repeat that while theoretically and technically television may be feasible, yet commercially and financially, I consider it an impossibility; a development of which we need not waste little time in dreaming.
Lee de Forest
1926

This foolish idea of shooting at the moon is an example of the absurd length to which vicious specialization will carry scientists. To escape the Earth's gravitation a projectile needs a velocity of 7 miles per second. The thermal energy at this speed is 15,180 calories [per gram]. Hence the proposition appears to be basically impossible.
A. W. Bickerton
1926

This fellow Charles Lindbergh will never make it. He’s doomed.
Harry Guggenheim, millionaire aviation enthusiast

Physics, as we know it, will be over in six months.
Max Born
1928

There is no likelihood that man can ever tap the power of the atom. The glib supposition of utilizing atomic energy when our coal has run out is a completely unscientific Utopian dream, a childish bug-a-boo.
Robert Millikan
1928

Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.
Irving Fisher, Professor of Economics, Yale University
1929

There is no hope for the fanciful idea of reaching the Moon because of insurmountable barriers to escaping the Earth's gravity.
Forest Ray Moulton, astronomer
1932

The energy produced by the atom is a very poor kind of thing. Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.
Ernst Rutherford
1933

There will never be a bigger plane built.
A Boeing engineer, after the first flight of the Boeing 247 that held ten people
1933

The star has to go on radiating and radiating and contracting and contracting until, I suppose, it gets down to a few km radius, when gravity becomes strong enough to hold in the radiation, and the star can at last find peace. … I think there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!
Arthur Stanley Eddington on the Chandrasekhar limit
1935

A rocket will never be able to leave the earth’s atmosphere.
The New York Times
1936

As far as sinking a ship with a bomb is concerned, you just can't do it.
Rear Admiral Clark Woodward
1939

Atomic energy might be as good as our present-day explosives, but it is unlikely to produce anything very much more dangerous.
Winston Churchill
1939

Even considering the improvements possible...the gas turbine could hardly be considered a feasible application to airplanes because of the difficulties of complying with the stringent weight requirements.
Gas Turbine Committee of the U. S. National Academy Of Sciences
1940

It is too far-fetched to be considered.
Editor of Scientific American, in a letter to Robert Goddard about Goddard’s idea of a rocket-accelerated airplane bomb
1940

The Americans are good about making fancy cars and refrigerators, but that doesn’t mean they are any good at making aircraft. They are bluffing. They are excellent at bluffing.
Hermann Goering, Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe
1942

Since the 40-inch objective of the Yerkes refractor and the 200-inch mirror of the Palomar reflector have apparently reached the practical construction limits for telescopes of their respective types, it is extremely doubtful if a greater light-gathering eye of either kind will ever again be built.
A. Frederick Collins
1942

I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.
Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of IBM
1943

This is the biggest fool thing we’ve ever done – the bomb will never go off – and I speak as an expert on explosives.

I am bold enough to say that a man-made Moon voyage will never occur regardless of all scientific advances.
Lee De Forest
1957

I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a fad that won’t last out the year.
The editor in charge of business books for Prentice Hall
1957

To place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon where the passengers can make scientific observations, perhaps land alive, and then return to earth-all that constitutes a wild dream worthy of Jules Verne. I am bold enough to say that such a man-made voyage will never occur regardless of all future advances.
Lee de Forest
1957

We will bury you.
Nikita Kruschev

Air pollution may obliterate the sun and cause a new ice age in the first third of the next century.
Boston Globe
1970

In the next 50 years, the fine dust man constantly puts into the atmosphere by fossil fuel-burning could screen out so much sunlight that the average temperature could drop by six degrees. If sustained over five to 10 years, such a temperature decrease could be sufficient to trigger an ice age!
Dr. S. I. Rasool

So we went to Atari and said, "Hey, we’ve got this amazing thing, even built with some of your parts, and what do you think about funding us? Or we’ll give it to you. We just want to do it. Pay our salary, we’ll come work for you." And they said, "No." So then we went to Hewlett–Packard, and they said, "Hey, we don’t need you. You haven’t got through college yet.”
