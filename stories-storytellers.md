## The prediction industry

Since we can't even know what we *don't* know about the future, we hire people to deliver [certain](understanding-certainty.md) statements about [the unknown](unknown.md). At one time they were part of a [religious order](religion.md) as prophets, soothsayers, or seers. With the move toward secularization and [post-modern thinking](philosophy.md), they are now game theorists, quantitative analysts, actuaries, statisticians, and poll analysts under a type of [scientific order](science.md). Irrespective, they are effectively [imagining](imagination.md) everything they do to create compelling [stories](stories.md).

They can only work on the [logic](logic.md) of known things, but they continue having jobs and receiving [honor](image.md) because they're the [safest](/safety/) way to explore the [fear](/fear/) of [the unknown](/unknown/). Ironically, most of their analysis comes from *their* fears, and their risk aversion frequently contributes heavily to suppressing healthy [social risks](/social-risk/).

For the sake of their livelihood, most of them will justify their [beliefs](/certainty/) with many [reports](/math/). If it confuses [leaders](/groups-large/) enough, those leaders will often [agree](/boundaries/) and trust them even more. However, the opinions of a veteran professional in a [specialty](/specialization-cities/) still have more validity.
