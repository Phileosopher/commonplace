## The prediction industry

Since we can't even know what we *don't* know about the future, we hire people to deliver [certain](understanding-certainty.md) statements about [the unknown](unknown.md). At one time they were part of a [religious order](religion.md) as prophets, soothsayers, or seers. With the move toward secularization and [post-modern thinking](philosophy.md), they are now game theorists, quantitative analysts, actuaries, statisticians, and poll analysts under a type of [scientific order](science.md). Irrespective, they are effectively [imagining](imagination.md) everything they do to create compelling [stories](stories.md).

They can only work on the [logic](logic.md) of known things, but they continue having jobs and receiving [honor](image.md) because they're the [safest](safety.md) way to explore the [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) of [the unknown](unknown.md). Ironically, most of their analysis comes from *their* fears, and their risk aversion frequently contributes heavily to suppressing healthy [social risks](socialrisk.md).

For the sake of their livelihood, most of them will justify their [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md) with many [reports](math.md). If it confuses [leaders](groups-large.md) enough, those leaders will often [agree](people-conflicts.md) and trust them even more. However, the opinions of a veteran professional in a [specialty](jobs-spcialization.md) still have more validity.
