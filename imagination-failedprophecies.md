# Failed prophecies of the end of the world - AD 0-1199

Numerous people have tried to predict the end of the world with elaborate timetables.

Most date-setters don't realize [humanity has a pretty unreliable record of time](datetime.md). Priests usually kept the days, and many of them would alter the dates to fit [political purposes](power-types.md).

A few failings from 100 B.C. to 2000 A.D.:

- 46 B.C. was 445 days long.
- There was no year 0 B.C.
- The Catholic Church switched from Julian Years to Gregorian in 1582, which cancels a leap day about every 100 years, and the Protestants only switched a long time later.

All of these are here for your benefit to understand how much humanity has failed at [predicting](imagination-badpredictions.md) the end.

- If a prophet predicts the future, and is wrong, they're not a good prophet.
  - [Deuteronomy 18:21-22](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18.htm)
- Jesus emphasizes that nobody knows [when he's coming back](jesus-returns.md), not even himself.
  - [Matthew 24:36](https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm)
  - [Mark 13:32](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm)
