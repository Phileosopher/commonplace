# Failed prophecies of the end of the world

Numerous people have tried to predict the end of the world with elaborate timetables.

Most date-setters don't realize [humanity has a pretty unreliable record of time](datetime.md). Priests usually kept the days, and many of them would alter the dates to fit [political purposes](power-types.md).

A few failings from 100 B.C. to 2000 A.D.:

- 46 B.C. was 445 days long.
- There was no year 0 B.C.
- The Catholic Church switched from Julian Years to Gregorian in 1582, which cancels a leap day about every 100 years, and the Protestants only switched a long time later.

All of these are here for your benefit to understand how much humanity has failed at [predicting](imagination-badpredictions.md) the end.

- If a prophet predicts the future, and is wrong, they're not a good prophet.
  - [Deuteronomy 18:21-22](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18.htm)
- Jesus emphasizes that nobody knows [when he's coming back](jesus-returns.md), not even himself.

  - [Mark 13:32](https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm)

This will submerge the Scandinavian countries and Britain underwater, in what is termed the Armageddon Flood. Siberia will be spared. He expects that aliens will intervene and lead the world into the fourth dimension. Currently, these aliens are on earth, but in hiding.

22,000,000,000

- Brad Larson's Big Rip theory predicts that the entire universe will eventually be progressively torn apart if the strength of dark energy increases with time.
