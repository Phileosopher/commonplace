# A list of exploits

Computers, all the way down, are nothing but math. Therefore, *any* computer system with sufficient attention toward it (meaning sufficient motivation for someone to try) is going to get hacked. Efforts like [encrypting everything](encryption.md), [hardening](computers-cysec.md), and [enforced procedures](computers-cysec-compliance.md) are designed to do several things:

1. Mitigate the damage or propagation of secure information.
2. Make the hackers easier to catch while taking that information (or maybe even mislead them).
3. Inspire the hackers to attack *other*, less-secure computers instead.

Here's a list of various exploits that have become public, which is by *no* means in any way exhaustive:

- Some of them are *really* severe, and can lead to identity theft of potentially millions.
- Others were discovered by [security researchers](computers-cysec-compliance.md) beforehand.
- Some were simply a disgruntled employee with too many [permissions](computers-cysec-authentication.md).

By the time you see it here, most of them have been fully patched.
