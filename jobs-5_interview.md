# How to succeed at a job interview

## What do hiring managers and recruiters want?

An interview is a [sales pitch](marketing.md) where an interviewer wants you to convince them that you're the product they want, *not* simply you begging for the opportunity to get a job.

To close the deal, you must fill the need in the customer's/interviewer's mind with your product:

- The interviewer's need is the job description.
- Employers only ask three core questions:
  1. Can you do the job? (strengths)
  2. Will you love the job? (motivation)
  3. Can we tolerate working with you? (fit)
- An interviewer looking for traits that show potential, not ability:
  - How you [organize](organization.md) your thoughts
  - How well you think quickly
  - Whether you connect relevant information to the job they're hiring you for
  - Whether you're [honest](people-lying.md) with them
- Employers find their answers from two other questions:
  1. Where have your last 5-10 years taken you?
  2. Will you succeed at the responsibilities we give you in the next 5-10 years?

You're a consultant, not a commodity:

- Consultants can fulfill needs if other people want them, so they're paid for their expertise but aren't offended if they're not needed.
- If, instead, you submit to a survival mentality, you'll be *way* more nervous and more likely to get a [bad employment arrangement](jobs-6_negotiating.md).
- You're a business partner trying to learn about the organization and work, *not* simply someone who needs money.
- Don't expect to get the job, but expect to do your best to try for it.
- They're *trying* to spend money (possibly on you) to make a problem of theirs go away.
  - Tell them why they want to hire you, not why you need the job.
  - You must understand [what they want](people-3_respect.md), not just [what *you* want](awareness.md).
  - If they want to see the next chapter of your career story, they'll want to hire you or, at least, network with you for future interactions.

You can't prove yourself with aptitude alone because an interview tracks the *image* of your aptitude (i.e., your ability to handle [stress](happiness-stress.md) and [anxiety](mind-feelings-fear.md) under pressure).

If possible, schedule the interview either in the morning or an hour before the business closes:

- People tend to remember the first and last parts of their day more.
- Ideally, aim for the morning before you build up any anxiety throughout your day over it.

## Your Interview Outfit

Generally, try to look as good as one of the supervisors in your field.

Observe tiny [clothing details](people-2_image.md) about other people in your industry.

For Men:

- Get a two-piece matching suit:
  - Use conservative colors like navy or dark grey for your pants.
  - The best suits have wool, wool blends, and other quality fibers.
  - Make sure your outfit is tailored.
  - Long-sleeved shirts in white, light blue or a conservative pattern are a safe bet, even during summer.
    - Try to cover up any tattoos.
- Have ties that match the industry:
  - This can be difficult, so research
  - The most common distinguishing tie is high-quality silk with a pop of color.
- Keep jewelry and accessories to a minimum:
  - If you want to wear anything, only get a wristwatch.
  - Match your belt and shoes.
- Shoes should be leather with laces or slip-on business shoes.
- Socks should be mid-calf length socks in a dark color.
- Things to never wear:
  - Silly or character ties
  - "Formal" shorts
  - Trendy dress shirts
  - Powder-blue suits

For Women:

- Match your two-piece outfits.
  - It should be fitted, but not snug.
  - Grey, dark grey, navy or black are appropriate colors.
  - Hem the pants so the cuff doesn't drag on the floor.
- Skirts should match your blazer.
  - Your skirt should completely cover your thighs when you sit down.
- Your shirt can be a tailored blouse, a good quality knit sweater or shell under your jacket.
  - Don't show too much cleavage or wear a see-through shirt.
- Most of the time, hosiery should be plain or sheer and a neutral color that complements the suit.
- Shoes should be medium-height heels or leather pumps that match the suit.
  - Once you start working, you won't have to wear heels.
- Things to never wear:
  - Mini-skirts
  - Deep V sequin shirts
  - Large jewelry pieces
  - Platform stiletto pumps
  - Tote bags
  - Gaudy or silly jewelry or bags

## Research the Company

Learn even more about the employer than when you applied for the job:

- Understand more about the company and their culture than one of your future possible coworkers.
- Search on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) for the employees and employer you'll be interviewing.
- Look for their connections to *other* organizations that may be relevant.

Understand the job description like it was yours:

- Go through it line-by-line and visualize what you'll do throughout the day.
  - Imagine your most likely challenges.
  - Consider the kinds of ideas you'd bring into the organization.
- For each responsibility or qualification:
  - Write out how your experience and skills fit with each part of the job description.
  - Consider past examples that are "supporting evidence" for your aptitude.
  - If you can't think of any direct connection, think deeply to find a [creative solution](mind-creativity.md) to overcome that shortcoming.
- You should be able to summarize everything you're thinking to a friend.

Tailor your approach to the interview style:

- In-person one-on-one interviews are "conventional" interviews, and used very frequently:
  - This interview is usually the most comfortable and personal, so relax and express yourself honestly.
- Group interviews work through candidates more quickly than one-on-one interaction:
  - Note other candidates' responses and build on them.
- Video interviews are long-distance through a streaming video service:
  - Note your room's acoustics and stay somewhere quiet where nobody will disturb you.
  - Stage a blank background or professional perspective in the shot.
  - Treat the interview as a performance of showing your energy through the camera.
  - Since the interview is a conversation, act naturally, but expect a 1-2 second delay for every line of dialogue.
  - Enunciate your words clearly.
- Phone interviews cut down the channel of communication to speaking-only.
  - They're still interviews even without a face-to-face, so take them as seriously as if you were in a video interview.
  - Stand up to articulate yourself more clearly and focus more easily.
  - Note your room's acoustics and stay somewhere quiet where nobody will disturb you.
  - Take notes of questions and comments to assist you in a potential follow-up interview.
  - Even over the phone, express positivity by smiling.
  - On a mobile or cordless phone, verify you have a clear signal beforehand.
  - You can't see your interviewer's non-verbal cues, so pay extra attention to not ramble.
  - Phone interviews often take more time than you'd expect, so schedule much more time for it.
- Test interviews prove your skills with an interactive project or written exam.
  - [Study and plan ahead](mind-memory.md) before you approach the test.
  - Test interviews are sometimes underhanded techniques to get free work done, so leave if you suspect exploitation or it runs for more than an hour.

Once you're there, tailor your approach to the interviewer's attitude:

- Some interviewers don't care about connecting with you or even the hiring process, and simply want to fill a position.
  - Prove your success with examples and demonstrate your work ethic.
  - Excite them by showing off your work history and plans for the position.
- To find weak points, some interviewers press on professional history to stir up stress.
  - Stay focused on giving proven stories that show your ability.
- Some interviewers have absolutely *no* idea what your job will be or what you'd do if hired.
  - Stay professional with them, but ask whether they'll make a good boss.
- Some interviewers are *very* young and inexperienced, and maybe more than *you* are.
  - Use a savvy approach to sell your personality and experiences.
- Some interviewers are pleasant, relatable, listens, and will make you feel welcome.
  - If the interview becomes too casual, steer the conversation back to the job.
- Some interviewers are obsessed with specifics and minutiae.
  - Prepare many more details than you'll need to satisfy them.
- A few interviewers are willing to take risks for a broader reason.
  - Have plenty of applicable ideas prepared to impress them.
  - If they have tons of experience, give a plan that outlines your ideas for the position.

    - Asking the salary range gives an ultimatum to the employer to either value their employees or their money more.

### Illegal Questions

Before entering an interview, research the regional questions that employers can't legally ask:

- Age, race, ethnicity, citizenship, national origin
- Personal details like height, weight, club affiliations, religion
- Disabilities unrelated to the job
- Felonies, convictions, arrest record, some military records

You can only respond to an employer's illegal question with three possible answers:

1. Answer the question directly, but give information unrelated to the job that may sabotage their view of you.
2. Refuse to answer the question, but unintentionally phrase it to appear uncooperative or confrontational.
3. Examine the question for its intent and respond to it as it might apply to the job.
   - e.g., "Have you been to prison?"
     - "I've never stolen from a company."
     - "I have a clean criminal record."
     - "I made terrible decisions, but I've changed and those events are behind me."
   - In general, answer the question they can legally ask.

Even then, experienced interviewers can find ways to ask roundabout not-illegal-but-gets-the-concept-across questions:

- "In the event that we provide a job offer, it will be conditional upon a successful background check. Is there anything beforehand you wish to disclose?"
- "We have certain conditions for employment that may involve a successful background check. Are you comfortable with that arrangement?"

Unfortunately, if they don't want to hire you based on a condition you can't control, you can't do much.

- If they seem uncomfortable with anything about this question, save yourself the effort and time by leaving in the middle of the interview.

### Their Final Question

A hiring manager's last question is typically "do you have any questions for us?", and they ask it for several reasons:

- They want to see how good of a listener you are (i.e., asking questions they already covered).
- They're giving room for you to expand your understanding of the company and job.
- They want feedback to see whether you still *want* the job.
- Your question's framing gives them insight about why you're interested in the job.

Ask 2-4 legitimate questions based on your interest in the company:

- Your questions are usually the very last impression you'll leave them with.
- A little suspicion is perfectly acceptable (and they usually expect it).
- Keep track of time, and jump ahead to your most important question if you're coming up close to the 30-minute/1-hour mark.

You should *never* ask some questions...

- ...which imply entitlement and high expectations:
  - When will I be promoted?
  - When can I expect a raise?
  - Will I get an office?
- ...which imply a noncommittal attitude:
  - What's the salary for this position?
  - What are your benefits?
  - Will I travel around a lot?
  - What other jobs are available here?
- ...which imply laziness:
  - What sort of flextime options do I have?
  - Are there security cameras watching everything I do?
  - What are your dress code rules?
- ...that show you care more about job security than personal growth:
  - What is the retirement plan like?
- ...that imply a lifestyle with many medical bills:
  - What medical plan do you provide?
- ...that demonstrate a fear of competition:
  - How many other people are going for this position?
- ...which imply you'll exploit the job's advantages:
  - Do I get employee discounts?
  - Do you have any lunch perks or a food allowance?
- ...which imply they'll have to repeat themselves frequently:
  - (Any question that shows you haven't been listening)

Very specific role questions:

- What should I expect the onboarding process to look like?
- What's the schedule/on-call arrangement for this role?
- Can you describe a typical day or week in this position?
- How does the role itself differ from the job description?

Broader role questions:

- Why is this position vacant?

- Why do you think job applicants choose to work here instead of with competitors?
- What are a few of the most significant challenges in the industry, and how will your company approach them?

Manager questions:

- In this role, who would I work most closely with?
- How would you best describe your (or the immediate manager's) management style?

Self-examining/clarifying questions:

- Do you have any reservations or concerns about my fit for this position?
- Are there any parts of my experience you would like me to elaborate on?
- Based on my background and skills, how well do I fit the position?

Change-provoking questions (implies you'll create change):

- Is this team equipped to finding better and more efficient ways to do things?
- How do new employees expand on the culture you've developed here?

Questions about immediate actions (implies you're ready to go):

- What is the immediate need on your team this position will fill?
- What projects would I be able to contribute to right away?
- How will I be evaluated during the first three months?

Long-term questions (implies stability):

- What challenges will the person in this position face?
- What are your goals for this position?
- How is success in this position measured?

Give a great wrap-up question that implies commitment and character:

- What has differentiated the people previously in this role who were good from those who were great?
- When do you expect to make a hiring decision?
- Assuming I'm hired, how can I add the greatest value to the organization in the first 30 days?

## Practice for the Event

A. Write down at least a dozen likely interview questions:

- Write down your answers to those questions.
- You won't be able to memorize it, but you're trying to adapt your intuition toward those questions.

B. Practice the answers out loud until you speak it naturally:

- Interviews are smaller, high-risk variations of [public speaking](language-speaking.md).
- If possible, practice with a friend playing the role of the interviewer.
- Figure out the questions that make you most nervous and anticipate how you'll manage the worst-case situations.
  - You're not there to tell them your life story, so let silence persist if it needs to.
  - On the other hand, you must speak up to confidently share your achievements.
- Remember the worst-case scenario: you don't get the job and [keep looking](jobs-4_hunt.md).

C. Incorporate the interview's physical aspects:

- Practice your handshake.
- Maintain eye contact.
- Look natural and courteous, but professional.
- Sit up straight.

  - Be polite and friendly to everyone you meet, from the security guard to the receptionist.

  - Give a compliment on the elevator or to someone next to you.
    - However, if you're *too* polite or friendly you might be seen as creepy.
- Breathe, smile, and stay confident.
  - Nervousness is not the same as having no confidence.
    - Nobody can see your inner anxiety.
    - Discomfort is normal, and interviewers expect it.
  - They're only interviewing you because they think you're overqualified.
    - The hiring manager has a job vacancy that keeps them from *their* job, so they *want* to hire you.
  - Everyone else interviews imperfectly like you.
    - Imagine how the interviews went with the strange, weird, annoying, and awkward people you've worked with.

E. During:

- If you forgot to print the resumé or are late, apologize openly and quickly.

  4. Force yourself to remember each interviewer's name.
- Sit down when asked, then keep a good posture.
- Only use your hands to emphasize points.
  - If you're in a chair, keep them in your lap or on top of the desk or table.
  - Since they'll get stuck, don't interlock your fingers.
- Listen more than talk.
  - Think of your interview as *you* interviewing the employer to see if they're a good fit for you.
  - Observe conversational cues from the interviewer and give natural feedback.
    - Some people prefer small talk while others get to the point immediately.
    - Let silence persist when there's a pause.
    - In a group interview, observe what other candidates are saying and build on their responses.
  - Stay on topic and avoid straying into a tangent or rambling.
- Walk them through your resumé
  - Steer them towards the skills, experiences, and accomplishments most relevant to the role.
  - Don't expect to give your resumé to them unless they ask for it
  - Take your time with each interviewer, vary the questions or responses, and maintain eye contact.
    - You should be able to remember the colors of their eyes after leaving.
- Never voluntarily disclose negative information:
  - Issues with a previous employer
  - Personal problems that could affect your job performance
  - Criticism about the company you're interviewing for
- Fully, accurately answer each question.
  - Take your time with your answers, look thoughtful, and start your answer after they've finished the question.
- After the questions, ask about next steps in the process if you're interested.
- Thank the interviewers for their time.

## After the Interview

If you suspect anything that could be a larger problem later, walk away:

- The interviewer isn't honoring the appointment time and leaves you waiting, then doesn't apologize for it or offers lunch instead.
- You realize you don't want the job or have a gut feeling against taking it.
- You can see from the office that you wouldn't get along with the workplace culture.
- The interviewer [lied](people-lying.md) to you or the job seems like a [scam](marketing-mlm.md).
- Any of the managers whom you might report to are rude, condescending or unprofessional.
  - One of the interviewers insulted you or your background during the interview.
- The interview gave you a bad feeling:
  - You felt oppressed and pressured.
  - The company's interviewing method makes you feel like a slave.
  - Your gut instinct says something is wrong.
  - If you walk into the situation with a premonition, the situation [*will* get worse](people-conflicts.md).

If you like what you see, write a professional thank-you letter to everyone you spoke to, including the secretary:

- Send one to each hiring manager individually, which may require more research.
- Give a personal compliment if it's appropriate, but keep it formal.
- Address specific points from the conversation with the hiring manager.
- Repeat your interest in the position and state a few reasons why you're a perfect fit for the role.
- Reference shared interests to show you paid close attention to them in the interview.
- Share concerns they addressed in the interview and answer them, especially if you couldn't respond to them during the interview.
- Send or attach an article or link to the business along with why you think it's relevant.

If the employer asks for references, don't assume they're going to hire you.

## Stay in Touch

Try to connect with them on professional social media like [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).

Share something unrelated to your interview that publicly honors the company.

Recruiting is like dating, and new opportunities always arise, so the interviewing process *never* ends.

Always express your interest in the position after a week or two if they haven't communicated a clear decision.

## Keep Going

Since all sorts of issues can arise, do *not* give up the job search until you've signed a job offer and have started your first day of work.

- A good lead isn't a job offer until you've made [a contractual agreeement](contracts.md).
- A job offer isn't a job until you're at your first workday.

A manager can pass you over for many reasons, so don't take it personally:

- They may have removed the job or put it on hold.
- The job roles may have changed so dramatically that none of their interviews can fit the job.
- They might not have hired anyone and were looking for free consulting advice from job-seekers.
- They might have promoted someone internally.
- The company may have eliminated the whole department around that job.
- The hiring manager may [unfairly discriminate](hardship-discrimination.md):
  - People tend to unfairly discriminate most heavily while hiring on the basis of race and criminal background.
  - Since you're worth more than they can ever see, the only way to rise above their [evil](morality-evil.md) is to move on.
  - Only disparage them on social media with the assumption that future hiring managers will see what you post.

Don't beat yourself up about your failures, but learn from them.

Stay enthusiastic and engaged with other interviews and the [job hunt](jobs-5_interview.md).

If you start getting discouraged, [find satisfaction](happiness-focus.md) elsewhere: life is more than a job.

Eventually, if you keep growing and striving toward every opportunity, you *will* [get a job offer](jobs-6_negotiating.md).
