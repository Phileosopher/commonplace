## Preventative maintenance

A little preventative maintenance can go a long way toward your safety:

- Drink plenty of water to avoid or minimize most health issues.
- [Stay hygienic](people-image.md) to avoid infections.
- Breathe correctly by fully expanding your lungs.
- Keep a good, upright posture to move your entire body correctly.
- When your body temperature reaches 105 degrees, your vital organs are at risk of failure.
- Having a beard can help with asthma and allergies, and will also protect facial skin from the sun's radiation.

Maintain a healthy [diet](cooking.md), avoid too much [alcohol](fun-alcohol.md) or drugs, and [manage your weight](body-diet.md) correctly.

Closely watch symptoms as they arise, but don't presume the worst:

- As long as you're [staying prematurely aware](awareness.md) of your physical problems and making preventative efforts, you'll typically sidestep the worst-case situations.
- The most likely scenario is usually nothing to worry about.
- Like [auto mechanics](autos.md), doctors simply make educated guesses based on the symptoms, so they're not necessarily right.
- Often, your [attitude](hardship.md) about your ailments affects how your immune system responds.
- However, if you're not sure, even a little, getting medical attention can save lives.

Your urine color is a profound indicator of health:

- Clear urine is a sign of over-hydration.
- Pale or transparent yellow is a sign of being well-hydrated.
- Dark yellow means under-hydrated.
- Brownish-orange means severe dehydration or may mean liver disease.
- Pinkish red could mean kidney disease, UTI, or a tumor.
- Blue or green urine comes from a rare genetic disease.
- Foamy urine where the bubbles don't go away is a sign of kidney disease (though bubbles are typically normal).

There are also [many tricks for most minor issues](body-firstaid-minor.md).

## Itches, bug bites, and skin irritations

Use any anti-itch solution to tighten the blood vessels and reduce any skin itching:

- Apply anti-itch cream
- Rub deodorant onto the itch
- Apply baking soda mixed into a paste with water directly to the area
- Apply a mixture of baking soda and vinegar

Place slices of raw potatoes on the skin, which will also heal blisters.

If earrings irritate your skin, put Vaseline on them before putting them in.

### Poison ivy

Rub liquid dish soap onto the affected skin, then rinse after letting it sit.

Apply a paste of baking soda and water directly to poison ivy

### General bug bites

Before going anywhere, use DEET (diethyltoluamide, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, or N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), which deters them through contacting it.

Run the bite under hot water or press a hot spoon onto the skin to break up the proteins that cause the itch.

Make an X on the bite with your fingernails.

Apply scotch tape or nail polish to the area.

Mix a teaspoon of Epsom salt into a cup of boiling water, cool down for twenty minutes, stir, then place on the bite.

## Field Medicine

Everyone should know the basics of field medicine.

- Field medicine and first aid will keep a person stable until a medical professional can attend to them.

Unless you have medical training, don't try to move the victim.

Keep the affected environment sterile:

- If you get a disease or infection while helping them, you've doubled the crisis
- Wear protective gloves as a barrier between you and the victim
- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after touching them

### A. Before anything, call 911/112

It might take some time for emergency services to arrive.

The timer starts when they know the nature of your emergency and your location.

### B. Control any bleeding

Bleeding is the most dangerous emergency because people don't need to lose much blood before it's fatal.

A. Lie the victim down and restrain them if they refuse to listen.

B. Apply direct pressure with a clean cloth or sterile dressing to any wounds.

- Since it may intensify the bleeding, don't remove *any* object lodged in a wound.

C. If you don't see signs of a broken bone, carefully elevate the wound above the victim's heart to reduce swelling.

D. Once you've controlled the bleeding, keep them warm with a blanket.

E. Keep checking on them to make sure the victim hasn't gone into shock (enough blood loss that the body doesn't get enough oxygen).

- Keep them hydrated and warm.
- Without treatment, going into shock is usually fatal.
- Shock symptoms include cold and sweaty skin, a weak and rapid heart rate, irritability, thirst, and irregular breathing.

### C. Clean and bandage all wounds

A. After washing your hands, clean the injured area with soap and water and blot it dry.

- Wiping a wound dry can often cause tremendous pain and might reopen it.

B. Apply antibiotic ointment to minor wounds.

- Accelerate the healing process by keeping the wound moist and covered.
- Applying sugar or honey will kill bacteria through dehydration, dry out the wound, and promote fresh tissue growth.
- Apply aloe vera plant sap to small cuts.

C. Cover the wound with a slightly larger bandage or a sterile gauze dressing.

- You can use anything clean, including spider webs (without any dust on them).
- For injured feet, alternate wrapping around the ankle and arch.

### D. Reduce swelling

Swelling near the core (*especially* near the heart) needs immediate medical attention.

- However, swelling near the extremities (arms, legs, shoulders, thighs) is usually less severe.

Apply RICE for most swelling issues:

- Rest the affected area.
- Ice on the area for up to 20 minutes at a time.
- Compression, often with a bandage (or compression socks for leg swelling).
- Elevate the area, ideally above the heart.

### Special circumstances

#### Losing consciousness

- Stay focused on your next tasks or have the victim occupy themselves with a task to keep the mind busy
- If you stand up too fast and start to black out, tighten your abs as hard as you can

#### Drowning

People drowning don't give *any* obvious indicators:

- They're unable to call or wave for help
- Their mouths rise and fall across the water line
- Their bodies will stay rigid and upright

There are many other small indicators:

- Head low in the water with the mouth at water level
- Head tilted back with mouth open
- Eyes are glassy and empty, unable to focus
- Eyes closed
- Hair over the forehead or eyes
- Not using legs
- Hyperventilating or gasping
- Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway
- Trying to roll over on the back
- It looks like they're climbing an invisible ladder

A drowning person can only stay above water for about 20--60 seconds, so it's worth taking the time to [train yourself](http://spotthedrowningchild.com/) on what to see.

#### Choking

If you're choking with nobody around

1. Place your fist above your navel
2. Grasp your fist with your other hand
3. Lean over a chair or countertop
4. Drive your fist upwardly into your stomach and repeat until the object has dislodged

If the choking victim is at least two years old

- Ask the victim if they are okay
  - Don't interfere if they can speak, breathe, or cough
- If the victim can't talk, breathe, or cough
  - Point to someone and ask them to call an ambulance
  - Perform the Heimlich maneuver
    1. Stand behind them, make a fist, and place it between the bottom of the victim's ribs and navel
    2. Grab the fist with the other hand, then thrust upward sharply
    3. Repeat until the object has dislodged
- If the victim is an infant and choking to the point of not breathing
  - Place the infant face down on your forearm and support the head and neck with your hand
  - Rest your hand on your knee with the infant's head lower than its body
  - Give four blows with the heel of your hand between the infant's shoulder blades
  - Turn the infant over, place two fingers in the center of the infant's chest (right below the nipples), and give up to five chest thrusts
  - Repeat until the obstruction is clear

Choking can cause complications, so seek medical attention after every choking incident

#### Heart attacks

- If the victim is male, they'll feel pain on their left arm, have shortness of breath, and have an extremely rapid heart rate.
- Call an ambulance immediately, then try not to move the victim.
- Have the victim chew an uncoated aspirin.

#### Unconscious victims

A. Ask the victim if they're okay to determine their awareness

- Don't leave an unconscious victim alone except to call for medical help

B. Check their airways, breathing, and circulation (ABC), in that order

- Perform CPR if you've received training for it and the victim's ABC isn't present

C. If you see ABC and don't suspect any spinal injury, place the victim on their side with their chin on the ground to drain body fluids more easily

D. Cover the victim with a blanket to keep them warm and prevent shock

- Remove the blanket if the victim says they feel warm

#### Eye injuries

If the eye has an impaled object

1. Call an ambulance immediately
2. Cover both eyes with sterile dressings or eyecups to immobilize it
   - Covering both eyes will minimize how much the injured eye moves
   - Don't rub the eye or apply pressure, ice, or raw meat to the wounded eye
3. Always consult a medical professional after an eye injury

For black eyes, you can set ice or raw meat on the cheek and area around the eye, but not directly on the eyeball

If the eye has a chemical in it, flush the eyes with cold or room-temperature water for at least fifteen minutes

- Remove contact lenses after flushing, not before
- For one infected eye, flush them by positioning the contaminated eye below the good one to prevent it from getting contaminated as well

If the eye has small particles in it

1. Fill a bowl with water large enough for the victim's face
2. Have the victim open their eyes while their eye is submerged

#### Burns

Burns have three degrees of damage, and people can feel burn pain starting at 111 degrees.

- 1st-degree burns start at 118 degrees, or at 140 degrees for >3 seconds
  - Red skin that might be swollen or painful
  - It generally won't need medical attention
  - Pain receptors start feeling numb at around 140 degrees.
- 2nd-degree burns start at 131 degrees
  - Red, blistered, and swollen skin
  - Might need medical attention if severe enough
- 3rd-degree burns start at 160 degrees for >1 seconds
  - At 162 degrees, skin is destroyed on contact.
  - Skin is visibly charred and might be white
  - Usually very painful
  - Always requires medical attention

Treating minor burns

1. Immediately submerge the burn area in cold water until the pain stops
   - Cover large burned areas with cold, wet cloths
   - Don't break any blisters you may find
     - Hold a cut potato on the blister to help it heal
   - Put an ice cube in a rag to painlessly apply it to the skin
2. If the victim's pain continues but doesn't need medical attention, apply medicated first aid cream or gel and cover with a sterile dressing
   - Burns have many alternative remedies
     - Over-steeped black tea with over three bags, cooled to room temperature
     - Apply vinegar to alleviate pain
     - Apply aloe vera plant sap to heal it and reduce pain
     - Rub an egg yolk on it
     - Apply honey to it
     - Apply toothpaste to it
     - Apply mineral ice to prevent blistering (it will become a brown spot, then fade away)
3. If the victim needs medical attention or you don't know, cover it with a dry, sterile dressing and don't apply any cream, then seek medical help

Treating major burns

1. Call an ambulance
   - 3rd-degree burns need immediate medical attention
   - Don't try to remove clothing stuck to the burned area
2. Cover the wound with a sterile dressing or clean sheet
   - Don't apply any creams or gels

#### Chemical burns

A. Flush the affected area with cold running water for at least fifteen minutes

- If the chemical burn is in the eyes, flush it continuously with water and seek medical attention immediately

B. Remove all contaminated clothing and jewelry

C. Monitor the victim for shock and seek medical attention

#### Poisoning

A. Call your local poison control center or for an ambulance immediately

- Antidotes on labels might be wrong, so don't follow them unless a doctor has instructed you

B. If the poison is on the skin, flush it with water for fifteen minutes, then wash and rinse with soap and water

C. If the poison is in the eye, flush it with lukewarm water for fifteen minutes

- Adults can stand under the shower with their eyes open

D. Never give anything by mouth (e.g., ipecac, milk, water) until a medical professional gives you permission

- Keep a one-ounce bottle of ipecac on hand at all times in case of an emergency, but only use it when directed by a doctor

E. Always consult a medical professional after every eye injury

#### Bee/wasp sting

A. If possible, remove the stinger by scraping it off with a blunt edge like a credit card

B. Clean the wound and apply a cold compress to reduce the swelling

- Neutralize the venom with a paste of baking soda and water or toothpaste
- Relieve bee sting pain with vinegar
- Use Epsom salts
  - Stir two tablespoons of Epsom salts into a cup of water, then soak a cotton ball or cotton cloth in it
  - For many stings, soak in a bath of two cups of Epsom salts in a bathtub of warm water for twelve minutes

C. Remove tight clothing and jewelry from areas near the bite in case the area swells

D. Watch for signs of shock or an allergic reaction

- Allergic reactions can include swelling, itching, dizziness, nausea, or difficulty breathing
- Call an ambulance for any allergic reaction and continue monitoring the victim for signs of shock until help arrives

E. Check the victim's ABC's, then begin CPR if you've received training for it and their ABC's are impaired

#### Jellyfish stings

Don't pee on the sting since it can cause infections

Apply vodka to the sting and call an ambulance

#### Animal bites

A. Control any bleeding, but keep the wound open to avoid risking infection

B. Thoroughly rinse the bite by holding it under running water

C. Clean the wound with soap and water and hold it under running water again for five minutes

D. Cover the wound with a dry sterile bandage or gauze

- Don't put ointments or medicines on the wound

E. Seek medical attention immediately

- Report any animal or human bites to local police and health authorities

#### Snake Bites

1. Call emergency services immediately
2. Try to take a photo of the snake to help emergency services decide the correct treatment
3. Minimize the victim's movement, loosen their clothing, and put pressure on the bite
4. Don't take painkillers, and keep the wound below the victim's heart

#### Ear infections

A. Have the victim lie on their side

B. Fill the infected ear with 3% hydrogen peroxide

C. Wait about 5--10 minutes until the bubbling stops, then clean out all the earwax with a cotton swab

#### Sprained ankles

A. Elevate the foot

B. Wrap in a cold, wet cloth

C. Run one cloth from the bottom of the water jug to the bandage to keep it wet
