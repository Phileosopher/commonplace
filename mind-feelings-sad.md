# Sadness

While grief is a highly individual experience, we broadly transition through five stages:

1. Denial & Isolation - a short-lived response that buffers us against the first wave of pain.
   - When severe enough, even the feelings tied to the pain can have separate waves of denial.
2. Anger - trouble accepting reality, even while the initial shock has passed.
   - This anger will usually express as frustration toward objects, strangers, friends, or family.
   - The anger itself is a misplaced need for justice on our terms.
3. Bargaining - trying to regain control while feeling helpless and vulnerable.
   - We usually bargain with what we can do now, then move on to impossible promises, regrets, then pondering hypothetical possibilities, often including a deal with God or another higher power.
4. Depression - misery about the event, mixed with a feeling of hopelessness, that expresses in 2 forms:
   1. Withdrawn: making quiet preparations to say goodbye and separate from the person or experience.
      - Withdrawn people simply need a hug.
   2. Volatile: a varied over-reactivity to the experience.
      - Volatile people need simple clarification, reassurance, helpful cooperation, and a few kind words.
5. Acceptance - a withdrawn, overall sense of calm about the situation.
   - This is *not* happiness, and is simply a resting state for feelings to run their course.

At any point, any situation can make us regress and fall back through any number of stages, but we will have to progress again through the stages to reach acceptance.
