# How to buy an automobile

## Always buy used

Many auto manufacturers tend to design their vehicles to fail precisely *beyond* the five-year warranty.

- The only way to avoid "planned obsolescence" is to avoid purchasing vehicles that may be poorly [engineered](engineering.md).
- If you buy new, you can't be certain how well-built that year's make and model is.

Select a brand with a reputation for reliability:

- The first-year model of every auto is likely to have issues, so never buy them.
- Some vehicle brands will go through troughs of poor reliability, so a vehicle brand that *was* reliable might not be anymore.

Never lease a car, since it's unquestionably the most expensive way to own a vehicle.

- Right behind that, owning a vehicle within its 5-year warranty is the most expensive way to own it.

Buy autos between 5 and 15 years old:

- Anything newer than five years old will *dramatically* drop in value, and if you *refuse* to learn basic auto repair skills, buy at least two years old.
- Aim for a low-mileage vehicle whenever possible, since that determines how much wear the vehicle will endure.
- Only buy older than 15 years if you're willing to make frequent repairs yourself.

A dealership uses a self-created authority that "certify" pre-owned cars, so it shouldn't be part of your decision.

If you don't need a larger vehicle every week, get a smaller vehicle:

- Larger vehicles burn more petrol and are far pricier to fix when they break down.
- Even if you occasionally need a pickup truck or SUV once or twice a month, consider the price difference from renting when you need it.

### Research beforehand

[Look at the VIN](autos-vin.png) for precise information about the factory design of the vehicle.

Check the car's approximate market value, since auto quality varies wildly by brand and year:

- High-end brands are excellent, but are expensive to repair and [insure](money-insurance.md) because finding parts is difficult (e.g., BMW, Renault, Ferrari).
- Large brands are often reputable and tend to be affordable to repair (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Ford, Acura, Subaru, Mini).
- Mid-level brands create reliable cars, but they have a higher chance of breaking down (e.g., GM, Nissan).
- Value-priced companies make affordable cars that *frequently* break down (e.g., Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Hyundai).

Irrespective of brand, *every* used car is different.

- The types of failures each car demonstrates gives it a type of "personality" (e.g., frequent transmission issues, engine runs hot, false-positive engine codes).

Used vehicles will have 3 potential problems:

1. Mechanical problems
   - Take someone with you experienced with autos when you inspect it.
2. Poor maintenance
   - Request any maintenance records from the owner, like oil changes or repairs.
3. Was stolen or involved in a major accident

Write down *any* questions or thoughts you have while examining the vehicle, since you can always disregard them later.

### Inspect it *before* buying

*Always* perform a thorough inspection before you pay for a used car.

A. Ask for the VIN before arriving there and get a vehicle inspection report.

B. Examine the outside and body of the car in broad daylight.

- Check underneath for oil leaks and white dust (body filler).
- Look at the tires for cupping or gouges, which points to a more significant problem.
- Inspect for body damage:
  - Open and close all doors, then check if the door seams are the same.
  - Pull back the rubber around the doors and windows to compare whether the paint is the same.
  - Slam the hood to see if it's correctly aligned all the way around.
  - Compare the left and right side.
  - Pop the trunk to see any rear-end damage.
  - Check the factory seams underneath the trunk's spare tire.
  - Observe the paint reflection to spot any dings or fixes.

C. If you're allowed to, crank up the bottom of the car.

- Check the CV joints.
- Check if the engine or transmission has any leaks near it.

D. If you're allowed to, scan it with an OBD-II reader.

- OBD-II readers are as cheap as $40.
- The OBD-II port is usually somewhere under the steering wheel.
- Read any engine codes, if there are any.

E. Test drive it.

1. Cold start it.
   - A cold start is under 90 °F without the keys in the ignition for at least 8 hours.
2. Let it idle for 3-5 minutes.
   - Test the signal lights and all headlights.
   - Test the heater/defroster, rear defroster, and air conditioner.
   - Shift the gears several times.
   - Test the windshield wipers and radio.
   - Check the exhaust for drips or black smoke.
   - If the car is running hot after idling, turn it off and walk away for any price above its scrap value.
3. Drive through the city to the highway from 25 to 40 mph.
   - Listen for buzzing noises, humming noises, clicking noises.
   - Set the inside fan to hot and defrost, then set it to high and try to smell any leaking fluids.
   - Hit the brakes quickly without touching the steering wheel and see if the car swerves left or right.
   - Test the power steering by turning the wheels while stopped.
   - Drive it through an alleyway or near a flat wall to hear its running sounds.
   - Swerve back and forth in a parking lot to test the suspension.
4. Accelerate at 1/2 to 3/4 throttle onto the highway, then stay on it for at least 5 miles at 55-60 mph.
   - Check to see if the steering wheel shakes or the whole car seems to lean one direction.
5. Drive through the city back to the location, continuing to test the different systems.
   - If it overheats during the drive, don't buy it.

F. Assuming you're allowed to, reread the codes with the OBD-II reader.

- If the seller reset the codes, a test drive lets you see them.

G. If you like what you see, bring it to a mechanic you trust to do a final check.

- A $100 inspection may save you thousands.

H. [Negotiate](people-conflicts-negotiation.md) the price down if you can.

- If possible, avoid gender bias with a male present.
- Do *not* let the seller exploit you.
- If you can, have cash available to pay the full amount for the car.
- Never look desperate, and always be prepared to walk away.

## Buying a second car

Only get a *second* auto for the right reasons:

- You need multiple vehicles for [a growing family](parenting-children.md).
- You don't trust your current vehicle to reliably navigate from one place to another.
- Your time is important, so you want a [risk management solution](safety-riskmgmt.md) if your car fails.

It's also not uncommon to inherit a car from someone else.

- Generally, if someone is under severe [hardship](hardship.md), they'll often give over their car to avoid further trouble maintaining it (e.g., [too old to drive](hardship-aging.md), [medical condition](hardship-infirmity.md)).

Before getting rid of an old car, consider repurposing it as one of your children's first cars, a commuter vehicle or a recreational vehicle.

- It can be very convenient and affordable to have a commuter vehicle as your primary, with a second vehicle you can [work on](autos-repair.md) in your leisure time.
