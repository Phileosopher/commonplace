# Entrepreneurship for the computer industry

A tech entrepreneur is just like [any other entrepreneur](entrepreneur-1_why.md), but their focus will be *heavily* oriented toward the domain of computers in general, but more specifically in [software development](computers-software-design.md).

To that end, their personality must be less extraverted than most entrepreneur personalities, since computers are *very* anti-social experiences with [logic](logic-cs.md) and [programming](computers-programming-basics.md).
