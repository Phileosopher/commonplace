# How to recover from an addiction

Before anything, accept you have a [substance](addiction-substances.md) abuse problem.

You will *not* get out of your [addiction](addiction.md) by yourself:

- That substance gave you [satisfaction](mind-feelings-happiness-perma.md) and [meaning](meaning.md), so something else must fill that void.
  - If you choose another substance, you're simply swapping out one mental poison for another.
- Thus, the only "substance" that's safe is a supportive community of [friends](people-4_friends.md) and the release and personal relationship with [God](god.md).

Find a healthy community that supports your new lifestyle:

- If your friends abuse the same substance as you, your [habits](habits.md) won't change because they will sabotage any effective changes.
- Besides recovery groups, you can also find less direct support through [friendships](people-4_friends.md) you find through [clubs](groups-member.md) and [church](church.md).
