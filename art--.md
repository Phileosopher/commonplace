AESTHETICS:
ideal form always has an odd component to it
- it's often odd-numbered, representing visually as a triangle or some combination of triangles
- the eye travels along an odd-numbered mechanism on a repeat basis
- when it's even, it seems boring
- in social contexts, the number 5 is most heavily represented because it's the feeling of a crowd (above 3) but doesn't feel isolated or overloaded

an artist is responsible for avoiding the endorsement of sacrilege and vulgarity
- being offensive must be there for a distinct reason, and the artist is simply destroy the [Tao](humanity) when they aren't being explicit about that reason
- the artist often doesn't see themselves this way (i.e., "I'm just showing it for what it is"), but they are effective [teachers](pedagogy) of the [unknown], and are therefore responsible for their actions more than simply hobbyists

ON CREATIONS
all art, no matter what, needs a focal point
- that focal point is a centerpiece of the whole thing
- high-quality art knows to not have things that would clutter the central [message]

Francis Bacon literally created science fiction, a new framing of fiction that gave glory to the technology itself and changed how we think of technology and science
- the irony of science fiction is that it asserts a realism about the world, but also attributes a utopian longing for future technologies

## mediums

<details><summary>In some ways, the medium is not <em>that</em> important:</summary>

<ul><li>The medium will match what you feel most comfortable with, and each one has pros and cons.<ul><li>Visual elements (e.g., paintings, drawings, diagrams) are easiest for people to consume.</li><li><a href="/writing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing</a> permits complete flexibility with imagination and ideas.</li><li>Audio connects closest to subconscious feelings and thoughts.</li><li>Performance arts make the entire experience interactive with the audience.</li><li><a href="https://trendless.tech/software-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Software</a> (especially <a href="https://trendless.tech/game-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a>) is the fullest form of audience involvement possible.</li><li><a href="https://notageni.us/mgmt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creating systems</a> permits <em>other</em> people to be creative.</li></ul></li><li>Frequently, your talent in one medium can spill over to other media.</li></ul>

</details><br>

<details><summary>Every medium has its own rules for quality:</summary>

<ul><li>Learn the medium's standards and limits.</li><li>Even experimental and <a href="https://gainedin.site/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trend-setting</a> works acknowledge the rules by intentionally defying them.</li><li>Art can be time-based, static, or immersive.<ul><li>For static art (e.g., <a href="/writing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">novels</a>, films, music), focus on what occupies the center of attention.</li><li>For temporal art (e.g., painting, sculpture), direct all your efforts to magnifying the very last observed event.</li><li>For immersive art (e.g., architecture, <a href="https://trendless.tech/game-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game development</a>), pay extremely close attention to the <a href="https://notageni.us/design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user experience</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>
