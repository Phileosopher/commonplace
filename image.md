# The essence of image

While everything in reality exists to [the degree it really does](reality.md), we can't process it in its raw form.

Instead, we make an accurate enough [copy of reality](values.md) by filling in information from various sources:

- Our senses, such as sight and sounds
- Memories of our senses we've stored in our brains
- Things we [understand](understanding.md) other people have sensed, and aggregates of those things (e.g., [statistics](math-stat.md))
- What we [trust](understanding-certainty.md) and [believe](understanding-certainty.md) from others, extending across [groups](groups-member.md) we [identify](identity.md) with and [ideas](values.md) we hold

For the most part, this copy is *stunningly* accurate. It allows us to relive the experience as many times as we want, and we can combine two or more experiences to fabricate a third, relatively accurate impression (e.g., someone who understands operating an automobile and has ridden in a boat can [imagine](imagination.md) operating a boat).

While we [trust](trust.md) this image, it's not reality, and its flaws show themselves over time when our [imagination](imagination.md) diverges from it.

Everything we perceive will have relative and absolute components to it. Often, our [conflicts](people-conflicts.md) are over relative things we *think* are absolute, often from our [culture](culture.md) and [upbringing](people-family.md).

One complicated part of our perception comes in how things come together. In [reality](reality.md), the larger thing is *precisely* the same as the individual components combined, but our [values](values.md) make the whole *greater* than the sum of its parts based on its association to other values.

[Intelligence](personality.md) is the ability to draw connections across perceived details. The more intelligence, the more details, and we usually tend to specialize our focus into our [preferences](personality.md):

- Sensation - the [feeling](mind-feelings.md) something evokes.
- Composition - the components, parts, and elements a thing is made of.
- Usage - how to operate or [work with](mind-creativity-results.md) that thing.
- Limits - the capacity for when that thing stops being [useful](purpose.md), relevant, or [functional](mind-creativity-results.md).
- Role - how people perceive that thing compared to other things.
- Implication - what that thing alludes toward or against.
- Value - the [worth](power.md) that other people perceive that thing is to them.
- Inspiration - the [symbolic](symbols.md) associations to other things.

Since some connection-building skill is [innate](humanity.md) and some is [trainable](understanding.md), it's difficult to [measure](math.md).

Barring low-functioning [autism](autism.md) or specific [traumatic events](hardship-ptsd.md), we can't easily hold all this information at once in our minds. To condense it and make the [values](values.md) more clear, we build [stories](stories.md) out of it with the most important information, then throw out the rest, sometimes with the source information.

We build these story-images rapidly in the subconscious, so we're not fact-checking everything we've built. Further, since we're pulling from *other* stories encoded in our memories, this entire system is extremely faulty. We don't notice, though, because we automatically correct errors as soon as we re-perceive things, irrespective of prevailing facts beyond initial impressions. People usually only re-examine, however, when they aren't [sure](trust.md) what they saw or when they train themselves to have more [scientific rigor](science.md).

## Bias

We create [a bias](mind-bias.md) from our preconceived images. More images (i.e., [experiences](maturity.md)) means more bias layered onto our perspectives.

It's humanly impossible to *not* have a bias without thinking strictly [like a computer](logic-cs.md). Mostly, this comes from how all our experiences pipe through [feelings](mind-feelings.md) before they even reach our ability to [perceive](understanding.md) them. With [humility](morality.md), we will readily add more images and offset the bias with other bias, but it never goes away, and we will always produce values that define [meaning](meaning.md) and [purpose](purpose.md).

We have a highly self-centered view of the universe, where we impose our [purposes](purpose.md), problems, and [values](values.md) upon our environment as if they existed outside our minds. Even when we gather copious amounts of [data](math.md), we're just creating an [anecdotal story](stories.md) built around aggregation.

The only time we don't use ourselves as the center is when we [develop another center instead](addiction-centers.md), and our bias is made of a few "angles" that map our meaning to various elements:

- [Cultural](culture.md) - borrowing from our [family](people-family.md) and [values](values.md) we [identify](identity.md) with, where [meaning](meaning.md) is based on [social tradition](habits.md).
- [Social](groups-member.md) - the [power](power.md) dynamics around our [status](groups-member.md) in a group, where meaning is based on how we [imagine](imagination.md) others' opinions.
- [Personal](mind-feelings.md) - subconscious actions from our [experiences](hardship-ptsd.md) and [decisions](decisions.md) that create subjective sets of meaning, especially the things we [identify](identity.md) with.
- [Spiritual](religion.md) - far-reaching beliefs about God, [social trends](trends.md) and the [continuation of ourselves](legacy.md), where our personal sense of meaning is *extremely* limited.

We tend to add others' views to ours, proportional to our belief that we don't [understand](understanding.md) something ourselves. It requires a Herculean feat of [humility](morality.md) to accept we don't understand things enough that we give *all* other perspectives at least some value.

More often than not, when we find we're wrong, we will believe a *part* of what we saw was correct and will adapt other beliefs to fit it. Slowly, as some of those things never change [over time](maturity.md), we become more [certain](understanding-certainty.md) of ourselves.

Very often, two people can have vastly different images while perceiving a similar thing. It frequently comes from our background, but the way we process [language](language.md) has a profound impact on what we remember.

This bias opens up a guaranteed [risk](safety.md) that [deception and control](power-influence.md) can take hold in our minds. However, if we keep pursuing [the truth](reality.md), [the lies](people-lying.md) will fade away.

The basis of all [culture](culture.md), [social conflict](people-conflicts.md), and grander [social trends](trends.md) revolves around image, *not* [reality](reality.md).
