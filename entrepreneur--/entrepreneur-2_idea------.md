## don't give it away

The market pushes creators to give away their work.
Too often, we come to believe that giving it away, removing money from
the interaction, is the most generous thing we can do.
But that's not the case.
Money supports our commitment to the practice.
Money permits us to turn professional, to focus our energy and our time
on the work, creating more impact and more connection, not less.
Money is how our society signifies enrollment.
The person who has paid for your scarce time and scarce output is more
likely to value it, to share it, and to take it seriously.

A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible.

If you give more value than you receive while ensuring you're being
treated fairly, and not falling into a pattern of self-sacrifice, the
excess value you provide will overflow into public goodwill.

## finding a niche market

The genius of niches is they are too small for large competitors, allowing a nimble entrepreneur the breathing room to focus on an under-served audience.

Choose a niche market and focus so tightly that your product becomes the best in class, members of that niche will have no choice but to use your product.

The best niches are under the radar, and you have to get out and do something before you will find them.

As a self-funded startup you want a market that is already looking for your product, even if it doesn't exist. This is because creating demand is very, very expensive while filling existing demand is, by comparison, cheap.

A vertical market as a single industry or hobby. Examples of vertical markets include pool cleaners, dry cleaners, web designers, wine collectors and punk rock enthusiasts.

When consumers want something, they want it now, not years from now. Consumers in the commercial, government, and scientific sectors are no more patient.

Open innovation - licensing ideas from the outside - enables them to be first to market and to fill their shelf space with products consumers want.

## finding ideas

when struggling for idea topics, search Twitter for phrases like:
"I wish I had"
"I just paid someone to"
"is the worst product"
"is a horrible company"
"has a terrible website"
"is my favorite website"
"does anyone know how"

Companies that use Groupons are struggling for customers and need
creative ideas. Come up with other ways to promote the company or make
their product better.

We love to point out how broken things are, but we rarely look at merely
mediocre products and wonder why they aren't great. Why is this mediocre?

Being a musician and making a living as one are two different things. If you want to earn a living, you must get paid by someone who values your services. The question entertainers need to ask themselves is not, Are we talented? but, Do we have drawing power?

It is often much faster and more economical for a company to bring to market a licensed product based on a simple idea - an improvement or enhancement to an existing product - than it is to start at square one in R&D and go through the whole long, complicated, and expensive process of coming up with and developing an idea themselves. So licensing our ideas is really just good business for companies. It reduces their R&D costs. It accelerates their product development time. And it creates a multiplying effect: essentially getting other people to develop ideas for them for free.

A simple improvement or a small incremental change to an existing product is often the easiest, fastest, most cost-effective, and most profitable way for companies to bring a new product to market.

It's hard for them to think outside the box or even right beside the box, which is where many of the most doable and profitable ideas are situated.

Very few, if any, companies and investors go searching the Internet and "tweeting" for ideas to license or fund. Nor do they routinely (if ever) scout social media or any other media for ideas to bring to market. Nor do they frequent (if they visit at all) inventor and product developer forums in search of the next big idea, which in reality is usually a simple idea with big market potential. These services and media channels may serve a good purpose, but it is not to bring a licensee to your door, despite innumerable claims to the contrary.

It is far more effective to go out there and find a licensee for your idea. Doing your homework to identify and qualify potential licensees

## finding ways to market it

When creating a new business, design it to attract publicity from the beginning. Think about your business idea from a public relations standpoint. Can the business get good press? Is there a story? Is it topical? Is the business something people will want to read about? One of the most important PR decisions is your business's name and tagline. Before christening your business, ask yourself, Does the name get people's attention? Does it have positive associations? Does it sound authentic? Can the name help get us good press? Don't be afraid to choose a name that some people hate. You want something a little edgy because people respect a businessperson who takes risks.
