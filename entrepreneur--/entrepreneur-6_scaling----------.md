## asking questions

David had identified his leap-of-faith questions explicitly at the outset and, more important, had made quantitative predictions about each of them.

It is only because David focused on actionable metrics for each of his leap-of-faith questions that he was able to accept that his company was failing.

Because David had not wasted energy on premature PR, he was able to make this determination without public embarrassment or distraction.

## budgeting

You can improve cash flow by observing the following suggestions in a start-up's early days:
- Keep payroll down to an absolute minimum. Overhead walks on two legs.
- Never sign long-term rent agreements or take upmarket office space.
- Never buy a business meal if the other side offers to.
- Pay yourself just enough to eat.
- Issuing staff credit cards, company cell phones, or cars is the road to ruin.
- Play one supplier against another, ruthlessly. They want your business.
- Only enter a factoring deal in absolute extremity. Exit it fast.

## business development program

Identify the following: 

1. Primary Aim
  - Begin living your life as if it were important. Take it seriously. Create it intentionally.
  - What do I value most?
  - What kind of life do I want?
  - What do I want my life to look like, to feel like?
  - How do I wish my day-to-day to be?
  - What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my life?
  - Who do I wish to be?
  - How would I like to be with other people in my life : my family, friends, business associates, customers, employees?
  - How would I like people to think about me?
  - 2 years from now? 10? 20? End of life?
  - What specifically would I like to learn during my life : spiritually, physically, financially, technically, intellectually, about relationships?

2. Strategic Objective
  - Your strategic objective is a very clear statement of what your business has to ultimately do for you to achieve your primary aim.
  - The first standard is gross revenues. How big will your company be when it's finally done? Know your gross profits, pretax profits, after-tax profits.
  - You can't know all this, but any standards are better than no standards.
  - Does the business I have in mind alleviate a frustration experienced by a large enough group of consumers to make it worth my while?
  - Central demographic model : a most probable customer.

3. Organizational Strategy
  - The organizational development reflected in the Organizational Chart can have a more profound impact on a small company than any other single business development step.
  - More companies organize around personalities rather than around functions. (& the result is chaos)
  - Make a chart of positions : COO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, VP Finance, Sales manager, Advertising/Research manager, Production manager, Service manager, Facilities manager, Accounts receivable manager, Accounts payable manager. (clear tree of who reports to who)
  - A position contract : a summary of the results to be achieved by each position in the company, the work that position is accountable for, a list of standards by which results are to be evaluated. Sign off on it. Not a job description, it is a contract between the company, employee, and a summary of the rules of the game. It provides each person with a sense of commitment and accountability.
  - Look at each position as a franchise prototype of its own.
    - When one goes to work in a position, one goes to work ON a position, implementing the business development process of innovation, quantification, orchestration.
  - Don't hire someone with experience. Not a master technician. A novice, a beginner, an apprentice. Someone eager to learn how to do it right. Willing to learn what you've spent so much time and energy discovering. Someone who is open to the possibility of learning skills not developed yet, skills he/she wants to learn.
  - If you don't obey the rules, honor them, extol them, why should you expect anyone else to take your game seriously?

4. Management Strategy
  - You may think your plan depends on highly skilled people. It doesn't. You don't need such people. You can't afford them. They will become the bane of your existence.
    - What you need is a mangement system.
    - The system will become your management strategy, and produces the results you want.
    - The system will become your solution to the problems of unpredictable people, by orchestrating the process by which management decisions are made, while eliminating the need for such decisions whenever possible.
  - A management system is a system designed into your prototype to produce a marketing result.
    - The more automatic that system is, the more effective your franchise prototype will be.
    - Management development - the process through which you create your management system, and teach up-and-upcoming managers to use it, isn't a management tool - it's a marketing tool.
    - Its purpose is not just to create an efficient prototype but an effective one : one that finds and keeps customers, profitably, better than any other.

5. People Strategy
  - "How do I get my people to do what I want?"
  - You can't get your people to do anything.
  - If you want it done, create an environment where "doing it" is more important to them than not doing it. Where "doing it" well becomes a way of life.
  - The work we do is a reflection of who we are. If we're sloppy at it, it's because we're sloppy inside. If we're late, it's because we're late inside. If we're bored, we're bored inside.
  - The most menial work can be a piece of art when done by an artist.
  - So the job here is not outside of ourselves, but inside of ourselves.
  - Make sure they understand the idea behind the work they're being asked to do. An idea more important than the work itself.
  - Everyone who works here is expected to work towards being the best he can possibly be at the tasks he's accountable for. When he can't do that, he should act like he is. If unwilling to act, leave.
  - A business is like a martial arts practice hall - a dojo - a place you go to practice being the best you can be.
  - A game to be played in which the rules symbolize the idea you, the owner, have about the world.
  - The degree to which they buy into your game doesn't depend on them but on how well you communicate the game to them - at the outset of the relationship - not after it's begun.
  - Your People Strategy is the way you communicate your idea.
    1. Never try to make a game out of what you want your people to do. The game has to come first, what your people do comes second. (?)
    2. Never create a game you're unwilling to play yourself.
    3. Make sure there are ways of winning the game without ending it. (never actually end it, but give occasional victories)
    4. Change the game from time to time : the tactics, not the strategy. (any game can become boring, no matter how extraordinary it was. anticipate the end before anyone else does, and change it by executive action)
    5. Remind people of the game, constantly. Once a week, have a meeting about the game. Once a day, make some kind of issue about an exception to the way the game has been played, and make certain everyone knows about it.
    6. The game has to make sense.
    7. The game needs to be fun from time to time. (not all the time)
    8. If you can't think of a good game, steal one.
  - Hierarchy of systems: (where the "it" is the stated purpose of your business.)
    1 : how we do it here
    2 : how we recruit, hire, and train people to do it here
    3 : how we manage it here
    4 : how we change it here

6. Marketing Strategy
  - When it comes to marketing, what you want is unimportant. It's what your customer wants that matters.
  - What your customer wants is probably different that what he thinks he wants.
  - Make a promise the customer wants to hear, then deliver on that promise better than anyone else on the block.
  - The COO is the driver of all of this. The COO connects each part of the business process. The COO maintains the integrity of the whole.

7. Systems Strategy
  - A system is a set of things, actions, ideas, and information that interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems. (?)
  - Information is the glue that holds your system strategy together. It tells you when and why you need to change.

## financing and fundraising

Capital - Money that business owners invest to acquire assets and start operating, also known as Start-Up Costs

Take the cash and momentum you get from being at the Local Max (big fish small pond), and invest a fraction of it into a new smaller team without traditional constraints that will launch something new and disruptive. Even something that competes.
Local Max companies make 2 big mistakes:
1 - believing they can get to the next Max in a linear, pain-free way
2 - believing the best way to get there is with brute force (more products, salespeople, ads, buildings, staff)
The opposite is true. The more you coddle your new team, the harder it will be for them to find the new Max.

"Seed money" also encourages people to give more to charities.
Seed money refers to the practice of lining up major grants in advance,
before announcing a "capital campaign" to raise a certain sum of money,
often as high as $100 million or more.
The seed money shows that prestigious and wealthy donors are already
committed to the cause.
When the initial seed money is high, the subsequent fund-raising tends
to go very well.
One of List's experiments found that raising seed money from 10 to 67
percent leads to a nearly sixfold increase in subsequent contributions.
Like a matching grant, seed money signals that the charity is part of a
powerful and noble endeavor; the charity is the winning team, so to speak.

Ask funders for money, and they'll give you advice; but ask for advice and they'll give you money.

Money is overrated. Truly new things rarely need an abundance of money. If that was so, billionaires would have a monopoly on inventing new things, and they don't. Instead almost all breakthroughs are made by those who lack money, because they are forced to rely on their passion, persistence and ingenuity to figure out new ways. Being poor is an advantage in innovation.

People with an idea ask me, "Should I raise VC money yet?" NO, of course
not! First you have to hustle.

It is often easier to raise money or acquire other resources when you have zero revenue, zero customers, and zero traction than when you have a small amount. Zero invites imagination, but small numbers invite questions about whether large numbers will ever materialize. Everyone knows (or thinks he or she knows) stories of products that achieved breakthrough success overnight. As long as nothing has been released and no data have been collected, it is still possible to imagine overnight success in the future. Small numbers pour cold water on that hope.
