## accepting uncertainty

You can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it.

You can also expect the future to be either better or worse than the present. Optimists welcome the future; pessimists fear it. Combining these possibilities yields four views:
INDEFINITE PESSIMISM
This describes Europe. An indefinite pessimist looks out onto a bleak future, but he has no idea what to do about it. All he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat, drink, and be merry in the meantime: hence Europe's famous vacation mania.
DEFINITE PESSIMISM
A definite pessimist believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it. Chinese leadership is obsessed with the way in which things threaten to get worse. Every class of people in China takes the future deadly seriously.
DEFINITE OPTIMISM
To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better.
INDEFINITE OPTIMISM
To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn't know how exactly, so he won't make any specific plans. Baby Boom produced a generation of indefinite optimists so used to effortless progress that they feel entitled to it.

While a DEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC future would need engineers to design underwater cities and settlements in space, an INDEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC future calls for more bankers and lawyers. Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth.

DEFINITE OPTIMISM works when you build the future you envision.
DEFINITE PESSIMISM works by building what can be copied without expecting anything new.
INDEFINITE PESSIMISM works because it's self-fulfilling: if you're a slacker with low expectations, they'll probably be met.
But INDEFINITE OPTIMISM seems inherently unsustainable: how can the future get better if no one plans for it? Evolution.

Would-be entrepreneurs are told that nothing can be known in advance: we're supposed to listen to what customers say they want, make nothing more than a "minimum viable product," and iterate our way to success. But leanness is a methodology, not a goal.

We have to find our way back to a definite future.

A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world.

Once you think that you're playing the lottery, you've already psychologically prepared yourself to lose.

## already-explored ideas

Pick a boring business. Everyone is always on the lookout for "the next
big thing." Just do the old, old thing slightly better than everyone else.

## believing in it

Ask, "Would anyone cry if I went out of business?" If the answer is no,
you're on the wrong path.

When you attempt to satisfy your personal values without providing any
real social value, you get the starving-artist syndrome : you may be
inspired by work you love doing, but it won't pay the bills.

The solution is to work within the area of overlap between your personal
values and social values. This will enable you to do what you love while
creating something that others treasure as well. Don't force yourself to
choose between your integrity and your income - demand that both be
satisfied.

Often the simplest way to create value for others is by sharing what you
love to do.

## checking if there's a void

We carefully research the Achilles heels of different global industries, and only when we feel we can potentially turn an industry on its head, and fulfil our key role as the consumer's champion, do we move in on it.

PaulGraham - Here is why I received so much criticism: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.

The marketplace is theoretically the best mechanism for matching supply with demand, establishing prices, and extracting maximum utility from finite resources. So why don't all individuals act as individual buyers and sellers, rather than gather in companies with tens of thousands of coworkers?

Compelling high resolution images have become ubiquitous, yet professional photo agencies treat them like a scarce resource. (iStockPhoto changes that equation)

"To build a new system, you don't compete with the old one, you build a new system that makes the old one obsolete" - Buckminster Fuller

What valuable company is nobody building?

Our contrarian question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on?

Contrarian thinking doesn't make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.

The business version of our contrarian question: What valuable company is nobody building? Every correct answer is necessarily a secret.

Something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable.

Are there any fields that matter but haven't been standardized and institutionalized?

The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.

Rigorous creativity to reach the silent needs.

Business book publishers, for example, must understand booksellers, and corporations that buy books, and the individual readers within those companies.
Hotel managers must understand travel agents, and corporations that have offsite meetings, and the human resources people who organize the corporate offsites, and the people at the company that will be attending the offsite.
Expanding the customer field of vision is critical.

Given three or four potential customers, who is the mose important?
On whom should a business design be most sharply focused?

A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.

Keep asking yourself these two questions:
How can I create and deliver more value?
How can I increase my capacity for value creation?

Learning how to focus on my customers' tastes rather than my own was an important, early business lesson that has served me well. Any successful businessperson knows you have to do whatever it takes to get objective market research. Just spouting off about what you think the market wants or needs isn't good enough.

Find the answers to these six critical questions:
1. Who are my competitors? Identify both the major players and the smaller players.
2. How does my idea compare and contrast with other products in the market?
3. What value does it offer that the other products do not?
4. How large is the market?
5. Who are my primary customers?
6. What are my potential sales?

Most people innovate backward. They develop a product to solve a problem that bothers them personally without first confirming that it bothers the market universally.

Instead of creating a new market for your idea, create an idea for an existing market.

It's one thing to create a product you like. It's quite another to design a product that consumers like and will buy.

Update or spruce up something that has been around, relatively unchanged, for a long time.

Five simple strategies to product-scouting success:
1. Become a licensing expert.
2. Find your niche.
3. Study the market.
4. Focus on ideas you can sell.
5. Cut a win-win agreement.

It's not about how big or small, how complex or simple, or how unique or clever your idea is. It's about which idea is going to take the least amount of work and has the highest probability of success.

Whenever I come up with an idea I'm interested in, I give it this four-step litmus test to see if it's a potential winner worth pursuing further:
1. Does it solve a common problem?
2. Does it have a wow factor?
3. Does it have a large market?
4. Does it use common production methods and materials?

Companies don't want to educate the market about a product or create a new market for a product. They're like me: they like ideas that are simple to explain and easy to show its unique value. They want ideas that consumers will take one look at and say, "I get it. I love it! I see how it benefits me. I want it."

Whatever you do in life, find someone who has already done it, get as close as you can, and learn as much as you can.

Sometimes, because you're not an expert in a field, you can look at things differently and see simple ideas with mega marketing potential that the "experts" might overlook. But once you get an idea that fires you up, you need to gain some expertise in that field so you can make good decisions about whether and how to move forward with it.

If people are listening to or watching or buying something and you don't get it, inquire as to why. Learn to see through their eyes.

## count the cost

Note: this is essentially a base rate estimation model for companies in an industry.

Initiative is scarce. Hence: valuable.

The single greatest danger for a founder is to become so certain of his own myth that he loses his mind. But an equally insidious danger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and mistake disenchantment for wisdom.

The stories in the magazines are lies: hard work and perseverance don't lead to success.

It's the boring stuff that matters the most.

If your business plan depends on suddenly being "discovered" by some
big shot, your plan will probably fail.

Keep your day job.

## creative work

The entire experience of actually making it in a creative endeavor, though, is a matter of developing entrepreneurship skills.

## crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing has the capacity to form a sort of perfect meritocracy. The quality of work takes precedence over pedigree, race, gender, age and qualification.

Crowdsourcing has revealed that, contrary to conventional wisdom, humans do not always behave in predictably self-interested patterns.

People are driven to contribute for a complex web of motivations, including a desire to create something from which the larger community would benefit as well as the sheer joy of practicing a craft at which they excel. People are inspired to contribute to crowdsourcing endeavors for similar motivations, though financial incentives also play a role, especially when the contributors hail from developing countries.

What unites all successful crowdsourcing efforts is a deep commitment to the community.

Two shared attributes among almost all crowdsourcing projects:
- Participants are not primarily motivated by Money
- They are donating their leisure hours to the cause.

In this environment, the "professional" has never been more widely distrusted and the "amateur" more cheerfully embraced.

Crowdsourcing has no more regard for professional qualifications than it has for nationality. Companies like InnoCentive and iStock are meritocracies; all that matters is the final product. This is one of its greatest strengths.

The untrained eye is also untainted. Their (InnoCentive's) greatest asset is a fresh pair of eyes, which is simply a restatement of the truism that with many eyes, all flaws become evident, and easily corrected.

What makes the online community a more efficient workforce than one managed by a firm? The short answer is that communities are better at both identifying talented people and evaluating their output.

The types of crowdsourcing that traffic in collective intelligence take three primary forms.
- The first category is the prediction market, or the information market, in which investors purchase "futures" pegged to some expected outcome, such as the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture, or the Presidential election.
- The second form is the problem solving, or crowdcasting, network, in which someone with a problem broadcasts it to a large, undefined network of potential solvers.
- The third category is the "idea jam" which is essentially just a massive online brainstorming session that takes place over the course of weeks instead of hours.

Crowdsourcing is rooted in a fundamentally egalitarian principle: every individual possesses some knowledge or talent tat some other individual will find valuable. In the broadest terms, crowdsourcing involves making a connection between the two.

The brown socks beat Mensa!

Dell's IdeaStorm employs another crucial element of crowdsourcing - the crowd's collective opinion.

Microsoft, Eli Lilly, Goldman Sachs, and Deustche Bank have all used prediction markets to help determine corporate strategy.

The reason diversity trumps ability in a problem - solving scenario is because you can always throw the idiots off the bus.

Before the rise of mass reproduction - there was far less of a distinction between audience and creator. New musical compositions were distributed as sheet music, which could then be interpreted according to regional preference and individual whim. Entertainment was a private affair composed of people entertaining one another. There were very few cultural products that we would describe as "hits" by today's standards. This changed quickly and dramatically with the rise of modern technologies. The mass production and distribution of culture required a more passive form of consumption.

Crowdsourcing depends on the exceptions - Hand a camera to one hundred people and you'll get 99 blurry snapshots and one indelible or salable image. The essence of crowdsourcing such creative work lies in culling the brilliant from the banal.

Crowdsourcing creative work involves cultivating a robust community composed of people with a deep and ongoing commitment to their craft and to one another.

Crowdsourcing the stuff people make - as opposed to the stuff they already know - threatens to disrupt and ultimately displace established companies.

iStocker (Stock photography portal) - developed a credit system - a user could download one image for every image of theirs that had been downloaded by someone else.

People react with great hostility to the idea that crowdsourcing equals cost savings. No one wants to feel exploited.

If you are inviting the crowd to the party, you might as well ask them to help with the planning and cleanup. The crowd likes to be involved.

It is not so much about giving the crowd easier tasks, as it is about building a strategy around the fact that different people are good at different things, have different amounts of time to commit, or simply have different interests.

We had far more guests than anticipated and we didn't have anyone to greet them when they showed up. It was a fateful mistake. (Context - AssignmentZero, a collaboration between Wired and NewAssignment.net started a community portal but launched without having someone upfront who would manage the community.)

Don't try to control the discussion, just provide the room in which it takes place.

AssignmentZero's community of journalists ensured that the interviewer was well informed, asked challenging questions, and managed to elicit interesting commentary.

Most participants will have very little to contribute - tasks have to be constructed to accommodate a range of commitment levels.

American Idol heralded the dawn of a new era. Voting was no longer something you did every couple of years; it was something you did every few days over your cellphone. Voting became part of the culture. Today, people have the opportunity to vote for everything.

The contributions generated by the crowd are far too numerous for anyone but the crowd itself to filter.

Only the collective attention of the crowd, and its enthusiastic embrace of the five-star system, has the manpower - to create an effective filter.

Collective decisions made by millions of Internet users is being used to create a comprehensive classification system where users vote on which news stories of the day deserve attention. (Context - Digg.com)

Threadless (T-shirt makers) - All products sold by Threadless are inspected and approved by user consensus before any larger investment is made into a new product. Users also have the ability to check the 'I'd buy it!' box next to the scale.- a strategy called "collective customer commitment". The dual benefits of giving your customers a vote is you have their commitment and the company knows how much demand exists for every shirt it produces. Small wonder then that every shirt sells out.

Crowdfunding - Directly connecting the people who have money to the people who need it.

Who better to decide what should be created than the person who will ultimately consume the product?

Ten Rules of Crowdsourcing
- Pick the Right Model (successful crowdsourcing projects use a combination of these approaches)
- Collective intelligence or crowd wisdom
- Crowd Creation
- Crowd Voting
- Crowd Funding
- Pick the Right Crowd
- Offer the right incentives
Attracting a crowd is much easier than keeping them. The most important component to a successful crowdsourcing effort is a vibrant, committed community and understanding what motivates people to contribute in the first place. People ned to feel rewarded for their efforts.
- Keep the pink slips in the drawer.
An editor's role will be to lead a conversation, not to deliver a monologue.
- The dumbness of crowds, or the Benevolent Dictator Principle
People might be enthusiastic and capable of some level of self organization but they also require directions and guidance and someone to answer their questions. Most successful crowdsourcing efforts are products of a robust collaboration between the crowd and the individuals guiding them. These people focussed the collective and corrected for some of the common hive mind failure modes.
- Keep it simple and break it down
Modules that can be independently produced before they are assembled into a whole.
- Remember Sturgeon's Law
- Real talent will remain a rare commodity.
- Remember the 10%, the Antidote to Sturgeon's law.
If you find yourself inundated with submissions, don't bother sifting through them yourself. Allowing the crowd to find the best and brightest diamonds in the rough.
- The community is always right
Communities need a decider (as well as a helping hand, a shoulder to cry on, and occasional dean of discipline. You can try to guide the community, but ultimately, wind up following them.
- Ask not what the crowd can do for you, but what you can do for the crowd.
Crowdsourcing works best when an individual or company gives the crowd something it wants. People are drawn to participate because some psychological, social or emotional need is being met. And the need isn't met, they don't participate.
