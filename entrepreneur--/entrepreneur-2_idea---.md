## selling ideas

The only opinions that really matter are the opinions of potential licensees.

Companies are only interested in licensing ideas they can:
• Put on their existing production lines quickly and easily, with little or no modification to their manufacturing processes
• Distribute through existing channels in which they already operate or that are closely related to the channels in which they operate
• Produce at a cost and sell at a price that is profitable

Call the manufacturer and ask for someone in sales. I would say something like, "I'm Stephen Key with Stephen Key Design. I'm working on a special project for a client, and I'd like to send over some drawings and get a price quote." The sales rep is going to fall all over him- or herself trying to help you and supply you with what you need. Just make sure to send over a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), and make sure you've already filed a provisional patent application on your idea.

Send over a drawing, and I make sure to include "Patent Pending" on the drawing so they know some intellectual property protection has been filed.

Ask for a price quote on 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 units. The sales rep will go to work for you and come back with a price quote and all this other information to help you because the sales rep wants to get an order! It's brilliant.

Occasionally, I will call contract manufacturers and ask to speak to engineers. If I ask a few basic manufacturing questions and don't ask them to divulge any trade secrets, they're usually very helpful. Sometimes, you can't get them to shut up, because they're so happy to have someone interested in what they're doing.

If the sales rep or the engineer tells you that the company can't manufacture your idea, ask him or her why. This way you can understand the manufacturing process, then redesign if necessary.

To successfully bring an idea to market, you must control every step of the process - from developing your idea to protecting and licensing it. Throughout the process, you must also control who knows about your idea, what they know about it, how you tell them about it, and when. So protect your idea with a PPA and an NDA before showing it to anybody.

## start it small

Successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don't even appear to be business opportunities at all.

Every startup should start with a very small market. Reach a few thousand people who really needed your product.

The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.

It's always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market.

An entrepreneur can't benefit from macro-scale insight unless his own plans begin at the micro-scale.

Focus on short-term goals. Don't get ahead of yourself. Forget about designing a business for the next decade; instead, design it for the next year.

## there are best practices

Startup success is not a consequence of good genes or being in the right place at the right time. Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught.

## watching the market

The secret to success in any new sector is watchfulness, usually over a period of many years.

No sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great company.

The scope of a business' viability:
#1 = Market
#2 = Marketing
#3 = Aesthetic
#4 = Functionality

The product with a sizeable market and low competition wins even with bad marketing, a bad aesthetic, and poor functionality.
In the same market, the product with better marketing wins.
In the same market with equal marketing, the product with the better design aesthetic wins.
Functionality, code quality, and documentation are all a distant fourth.

## making sure it's viable

Creating value is not enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create.

When you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years, your instinct will be to come up with a story about how yours is different. You'll spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of seriously considering whether that's true.

In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't.

Only monopoly profits allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival.

Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it's rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything that you know.
- EXPECT YOUR IDEA, UPON BEING SHARED, TO HAVE A TIMER START SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD UNTIL IT ACTUALIZES
- IT MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY PRESENT, BUT YOUR IDEA, IF NEW, BECOMES THE START OF A [TREND]

So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there's always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody - and that's a company. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.

Franchising is risky
- You must consider the [contract] carefully: they might make money when you don't, or may charge you to keep going.
- Careful with competition: you're ALSO competing with the other franchisees.

Pay very VERY close attention to risk vectors
- narrow your scope of operations to avoid exposing yourself to too many competitive elements at once
- in a globalized, interdependent society, rando foreigners who can work for a fraction of your wage have an edge on you

The greatest rewards come from working on something that nobody has a name for. If you possibly can, work where there are no words for what you do.

If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is.

The one thing that matters most in determining whether your business succeeds or fails miserably is sales. The ultimate success of a product or service is 10 percent product quality and 90 percent sales.

Project/Product confusion:
A project is a software application that you build as a fun side project. The end result is a neat little application that likely isn't of use to many people.
A product is a project that people will pay money for.

The single most important factor to a product's success is not the founders, not the marketing effort, and certainly not the product. It's whether there's a group of people willing to pay for it.

Building something no one wants is the most common source of failure for entrepreneurs.

## making sure it's viable - know the industry

Sara had never done anything in fashion before. So she spent every day
at the library and the hosiery stores. She had a full-time job but at
night she researched every patent. She bought every type of panty hose.
She knew the entire industry. To succeed at something: Know every
product in the industry Know every patent Try out all the products
Understand how the products are made Make a product that YOU would use
every single day. You can't sell it if you personally don't LOVE it

When I was building a trading business, I must've read more than two
hundred books on trading and talked to another two hundred traders.

I felt like I knew more about trading and the top investors out there
than anyone else in the world.

When I was building websites, I knew everything about programming for
the web. There was nothing I couldn't do. And the competition, usually
run by businessmen and not programmers, knew that about me.

## motivation to do the idea

My driving force was finding new ways to give people a good time - ideally, in places where they were least expecting it.

The Virgin brand is about irreverence and cheek. It values plain speaking. It is not miserly, or mercenary. It has a newcomer's voice - and in a world of constant technical innovation, the voice of a company that's coming fresh to things is a voice people find oddly reassuring. It's a brand that says, 'We're in this together.'

People will work late into the night on one creative endeavor or another in the hope that their community - be it fellow designers, scientists, or computer hackers - acknowledge their contribution in the form of kudos and, just maybe, some measure of fame.

Threadless (Community driven T-shirt portal) isn't really in the T-shirt business. It sells community.
Ross Zeitz, a 27 year old Threadless designer was hired to help run the community after his designs won a record breaking eight times on the community portal.

## no going back

The first law of entrepreneurial business: there is no reverse gear.
No one in business can unmake anything, any more than a band can unmake a song.

## note the trends

Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network.

Four big lessons from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:
1. Make incremental advances
2. Stay lean and flexible
3. Improve on the competition
4. Focus on product, not sales

Yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:
1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
4. Sales matters just as much as product.

How much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes?

Consider the urban hipsterdom: the handlebar mustache, and vinyl record players all hark back to an earlier time when people were still optimistic about the future. If everything worth doing has already been done, you may as well feign an allergy to achievement and become a barista.

What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden or taboo?

Ask: what are people running companies not allowed to say?

Where is the profit?
In yesterday's world, the answer was: with the player who has the highest market share.
In today's world, the answer is: with the player who has the best business model, a model designed for customer relevance and high profitability.
- THIS MAY MOVE AROUND AGAIN SOON
- OR MAYBE IT NEVER MOVES AROUND? HAVE TO THINK ON THIS!

To create a strategic and dynamic perspective on the customer, one must have a clear and compelling point of view on one question:
Exactly how is the customer changing?
Write this question down. It is your single most powerful management weapon.

What if you had to start something? What would it be?
You don't need a good idea to start a business - you can steal one.
Find someone in another town or industry and do what they're doing.
Once you get started, your original idea is going to be replaced anyway.
Smart entrepreneurs don't stick to the original business plan.
You'll realize that every day is another day closer to success, and changing the plan is part of the plan.

The best odds of becoming a billionaire, in summary, exist in industries
that ride the key trends of economic development. This suggests that in
newly industrializing countries, great opportunities may remain in
infrastructure and basic industries. In the world's most developed
economies, however, the cream of tomorrow's billionaires probably will
emerge from communications, services, and technology.

High-growth industries that most often spawn vast personal fortunes tend
to be characterized by fierce struggles for survival. No one islikely to
emerge from such battles without a willingness to push the envelope.

How is it possible for three cowboys to herd a thousand cattle?
Easy. They don't. They herd ten cattle, and those cattle influence fifty
cattle and those cattle influence the rest.
That's the way every single widespread movement/product/service has
changed the world.
Find ten people who care enough about your work to enroll.

Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: "Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution."

Paul Graham, how to make a business work - make something people want

Early adopters: we often talked to them and asked for their feedback. But we emphatically did not do what they said. We viewed their input as only one source of information about our product and overall vision. In fact, we were much more likely to run experiments on our customers than we were to cater to their whims.

Early adopters are suspicious of something that is too polished: if it's ready for everyone to adopt, how much advantage can one get by being early? As a result, additional features or polish beyond what early adopters demand is a form of wasted resources and time.
- THE TREND WILL SHIFT AROUND YOU, AND YOU NEED TO BE READY FOR THAT SHIFT

Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing. They prefer that state of affairs, because what they care about above all is being the first

What if there are no businesses to study? Say you've done your homework, canvassed the landscape, and no one is doing what you're proposing. Usually that's bad news, which means you should take a step back. There are millions of smart people in the world. We all have access to the same information and therefore all hatch similar ideas. Most likely, there are reasons that someone has not already capitalized on your idea. Figureout what the roadblocks are before you get started.

Enter an established field. If your business idea is 100 percent original, there is a reason that no one else is doing it. Look around at what other businesspeople are doing. What works for them, and what doesn't? Both mistakes and innovations are best learned by watching others make them first.

if an idea is obvious but nobody else has tried it, there is probably a good reason.

Make sure people want what you're building before you build it.

Take the rifle approach and focus on an industry you're familiar with.

Stay plugged into new and emerging trends.
