### Focus every dollar into making the most profitable sales

Avoid impulse spending near the beginning
- Carefully assess every dollar you spend
- Sponsoring conferences to appear large isn't cost-effective
- Cut out any expenses that don't create results as much as you expected

You're selling yourself, not the product, and your personality will close deals
- You must tailor each product sales pitch to each potential client
- Loyal customers have more value than money, so advertise and celebrate them with referral bonuses and perks

A startup budget doesn't have any room for a hit-or-miss marketing strategy
- Only sell to a familiar market since an unfamiliar one will cause massive losses
- Use social media networks intentionally since a wrongly used channel might be worse than not using it
- Trying to keep dissatisfied customers is less cost-effective than losing them and working to gain new ones

Only hand the customer the product after the customer paid you
- The person holding the product always has bargaining power
- The customer hasn't bought the product until they pay for it, so only use lines of credit as a backup plan if they don't pay

#### Micromanage vendor relationships

Take pictures of business cards people hand you just in case you lose them

Trust your gut instincts with them

Rate your vendors and suppliers correctly
- Make performance indicators
- Classify every supplier and vendor
- Determine who has more power and influence
- Maintain good relationships with everyone
- Sever weak links

### The company won't make much money for a while

Slim or no profits will test your patience and resilience for weeks, months or even years

[Persevere](http://philosaccounting.com/a/success-4/) through unsuccessful times by understanding how low points are opportunities for growth and learning

Re-analyze periodically
- Conduct new market research or segment the market
- Reconsider the product from a different angle
- Revisit the business plan

Poor expense management is one of the most common ways to lower profits
- Learn [ways to shave down costs](http://philosaccounting.com/a/money-202-tricks-to-shave-down-costs/)
- Speed up everyone's workflow with better software, better equipment or new technology
- Improve your relationships with employees to boost morale by giving incentives

Sometimes you need a vacation to clear your mind

## reinvesting in yourself

Every dollar you invest in your personal development adds thirty to your bottom line.

I made $150,000 that year, and I took $15,000 and reinvested it in my personal development. The following year, I grew tremendously, and I've followed his advice ever since.

The greatest athletes in the world hire the most expensive coaches, consultants, and advisors. The greatest companies do the same.

## self-discipline

OLD tPA: Your Work
- Be passionate about your work - wake up every day ready and eager to do business
- You can't do everything on your own - you need a team to carry the weight that will come as time progresses
- Believe in yourself - you're selling yourself, not the product, and people want genuine boldness and confidence
- Do one thing really well - specialize in order to provide better service to who is being specialized to
- Don't expect to be an overwhelming success right away - even at the low points you will still be growing and learning

"My life is one long obstacle course, with me being the chief obstacle." -JACK PAAR

It is 6:00 A.M. And here I am, at the keyboard, in my home office, writing. That's what I do almost every day, for at least the first early hour of the morning, no matter what.

Self-discipline is the magic power that makes you virtually unstoppable. Self-discipline is MAGNETIC. And self-discipline aimed and applied at a particular thing, as I do to writing, as Pincay does to fitness, is quite literally a magic power. When you focus your self-discipline on a single purpose, like sunlight through a magnifying glass on a single object, look out! The whole world will scramble to get out of your way, hold the doors open for you, and salute as you walk by. It takes tremendous self-discipline to productively allocate and invest time and to stick to your intentions.

Because the entrepreneur is his own boss and can do as he pleases with his time, it is very important to be self-disciplined. The entrepreneur with a loose, buddy-buddy, easily forgiving boss will never accomplish much. It is the entrepreneur with the tough taskmaster as a boss who excels.

The only constraint of a company's growth and potential is the owner's ambition. I am the constraint. The market, the opportunity, everything is there. It's up to me to set the pace, clear the obstacles, get the resources, and create the conversations to grow the company faster.

As CEO, the most important thing I manage is myself. Do that right, and everything else falls into place.

Once you dig (find someone or something you like), keep drilling - go deeper.

## staying active

Nothing in business is quite like the early, frenetic days of an ambitious start-up project. There's always an amazing buzz about this kind of thing. It's high-octane and high-risk and it builds a tremendous spirit and camaraderie which takes everyone through some very trying times. I've seldom seen people work harder than in the initial stages of a new venture.
Once a business matures and is established, it can become more challenging to retain that excitement. What we do at Virgin is not let businesses get too mature. If you can keep the businesses relatively small, people will know each other within the organisation and feel like part of a team.

Learn to work fast(er). It makes you sharper.

Do Not Look a Gift Horse in the Mouth. Get On, Hang On, and Enjoy the Gallop. There are those times, those days, those "spurts," when you can do no wrong. Say "Thank You." Sleep less, gulp more vitamins, and go with the flow. Be alert for this happening, then fan the fire. For a brief time, you will want to loosen up your cautions about taking on more than you can handle and embrace it all. When The Phenomenon occurs, it's doubly important to be on guard against anybody or anything that may snuff out the fire.

Populating my work environment with "psychological triggers"-objects that remind me to think a certain way. I work at mentally attracting wealth, for example, so my primary work environment is full of things that represent wealth; at last count, 27 such pictures, objects, and artifacts were within view. Because I am very concerned with time, I have eight clocks around me. I have a wooden hangman's noose to remind me of deadlines.

Dentist: "I've made a list of 300 things to change in the practice." Every week, he did ten of them. After 30 weeks, he had done everything on that list, big and small. And, without a penny increase in advertising, without a dollar's difference in marketing, in the same office, with (almost) the same staff, his practice had more than quadrupled in volume.

## staying genuine

OLD tPA: The Product
- You may think your product is perfect, but your clients won't - your opinion may not be the best one, listen to user feedback
- Undercharging is not sustainable - focus on quality, expertise and niche focus instead of price, since any idiot can undersell
- When you think you've tested your product enough, test it some more - never release a product until it has been tested exhaustively by people who don't work for you
- If your company sells a variety of products, make sure you know how to use/operate every single one of them - it helps you look at things with fresh eyes

Steve Wozniak:
Have the higest of ethics. Be open and truthful about things, not hiding. Don't mislead people.
Always seek excellence : make your product better than the average person would.

Evan Williams:
What kills great things is compromise - letting people talk you out of what your gut is telling you.

Establish a culture of execution in the early days. The CEO should set an example of meeting goals, responding to customers, and heeding and measuring employees. This obsession should include the CEO's answering emails and responding to phone calls.

Better clients demand better work.
Better clients want you to push the envelope, win awards, and challenge
their expectations.
Better clients pay on time.
Better clients talk about you and your work.
But finding better clients isn't easy, partly because we don't trust
ourselves enough to imagine that we deserve them.

## time management

Ideally, you should schedule your day by the half-hour, from beginning to end.

You must systematically, aggressively divest yourself of those activities you do not do well, do not do happily, or find routine, so as to systematically invest your time (and talent, knowledge, know-how, and other resources) in those things you do extraordinarily well, enjoy doing, and find intellectually stimulating.

Contrary to all of government's ill-fated, Robin Hoodesque efforts, 5% of the people get 95% of the money. We have a sense of urgency the 95%ers don't.

Here's how to get focused, if you're having trouble in that department: identify and write down the three most important, most significant, most productive, most valuable things you can do to foster success in your particular enterprise. Just three. Write them down. From there, translate them into three actions you can take each and everyday. Write them down.

Nothing and no one can steal the time required to make certain that happens. Every single day. No exceptions. No excuses. As a direct result, "demand" for me has steadily grown, even as the "supply" I am willing to offer has diminished, which has allowed me to very substantially raise my fees, keep raising them every year, fire troublesome clients without remorse, and do business entirely on my terms, to suit me. This one single, simple discipline has been worth millions.

The best use you can make of a Blackberry is to buy them for all of your competitors. They'll never have time for another creative thought.
