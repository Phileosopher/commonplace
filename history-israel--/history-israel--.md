# Why no discussion on Gaza? (my response)

I'm not sure if your question was rhetorical, but there are several non-exclusive reasons.

1. It's the same reason American Christians don't talk about China or Nigeria: it's a foreign thing that they have no control over. It's a more pleasant and doable thing to talk about vacations and raising kids. It's the devil misusing Philippians 4:8.

2. The existence of Israel as a political state is confusing for most Christians. It's easy enough to believe in an abstract Israel that all believers in Jesus follow, but the weird popping up of a millennia-old society that fully lost their nation is certainly miraculous. Unfortunately, it gives the idea that God is also behind th3 decisions Israel makes, and political lobbying in the USA has cinched that concept through pseudo-Christian Deist virtue signaling.

3. In the American Deism social religious structure, it is a general American value in self-determinism (since God is another variation of the Stoic Logos). This means that it's ALWAYS your fault if bad things happen. I could write endlessly on this but the TLDR is that that is true if we assign a percentage: every party in a cqr accident is at least 1% responsible. In the case of Gaza (and West Bank), there is that 1% in that they're still living there when they "could just move", completely disregarding that it msy not be tenable, the neighbor nations hate Israel so hard they won't let the Arabs move (e.g., Syria), and that there may be political forces trying to maximize the suffering.

4. Most of the institute of the Christian church in the USA exists because it's an advantageous social club, and a good chunk of the leadership would prefer numbers over transformation. Talking about ANY persecution or political events gets in the way of that "spiritual environment".
