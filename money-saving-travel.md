# How to save when traveling

Research with an open mind about the cheapest way to get anywhere:

- Night travel is less busy and usually cheaper.
- For long distances, it's more affordable to sleep on a sleeper train than get a hotel.

Use a ride-sharing service instead of a cab service.

When buying a car, you will likely not be able to pay it all in cash, so calculate the extra fees for setting up a loan into the cost you'll pay:

- Differentiate between a need (i.e., being able to travel) and a want (i.e., social status).
- When purchasing, nothing stops you from paying off the loan as fast as possible.

## Driving

Don't buy premium gas.

- The quality difference is negligible or nonexistent.
- Additives are cheaper in the long term.

Join gas station rewards programs.

- Track your rewards as you acrrue them.

Avoid unnecessary wear on your car by driving slower and more carefully.

Stay on top of [preventative maintenance](autos.md).

- Wash your car yourself.
- If you use an automatic wash, the Basic is just as good as the Deluxe with a different color of soap.
- Even when they have a coin slot, gas stations usually offer air and water (for the tires and radiator) for free.

Increase fuel economy on highways with cruise control.

Increase fuel efficiency and tire lifespan by keeping the tires inflated.

Consolidate errands to save gasoline by traveling less.

Try alternate routes to navigate around traffic.

- Change your work hours to avoid rush hour.

Find driving alternatives:

- Find people you can carpool with.
- Research if routine trips are cheaper in a bus.
- Consider riding a bicycle or smaller motor vehicle.
- Telecommute if your work allows it.

## Booking flights

Try to time when you get tickets.

- The prices usually change about three times a day.
- To get the cheapest seats, book the flights 330 days before you intend to go.
- About 6--8 weeks before the flight dates, the prices will drop.
- Avoid Sunday flights if possible.
- Visit the airport directly in advance to purchase a ticket to avoid many of the fees.

Pay close attention to the myriad fees.

- Don't book your flight with a phone call.
- Avoid canceling or changing your reservation.

Always search in Private/Incognito Mode in your web browser because flight services increase their prices each visit to create a feeling of urgency.

Visit secondary markets that sell underpriced tickets to fill the plane.

- Whenever possible, use lower quality or local-only budget airlines.

Consider direct flights (one stop flights) versus adding a stopover with the same or a different airline.

Sign up for airline newsletters and airline promotions.

## Saving at airports

Pack items you'll likely need:

- Food (make sure it doesn't have a strong odor out of consideration for everyone else).
- Blankets
- Empty water bottles you can fill after getting through security
- Enough entertainment or reading prepared for the trip

Use a coupon service for discounts on airport parking, or have a friend or family member drop you off and pick you up later.

Checking in:

- If you didn't pay full price for the ticket, don't expect to get a free upgrade with the ticket agent
- Travel without a checked bag or mail it via parcel service to your hotel if you must bring one.

At the terminal:

- Don't buy any of the high-priced items at the airport shops.

If you're gracious to the steward during the flight, you can ask for anything free you need:

- Children's activity packs
- Dental hygiene kits
- Earplugs or a sleep mask
- First aid supplies
- Leftover meals from first-class
- Slippers or socks
- As many refills of your drinks as you want

When flying with kids:

- Buy the infant-on-lap ticket.
- Get a bassinet seat.
- Ask for a car seat courtesy bag.
- Carry your luggage in a stroller.
- Ask for children's snack packs.
- As long as it's not disruptive, you can always ask for a tour of the flight deck and meet the pilot.
