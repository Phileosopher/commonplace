# Legal doctrines and principles list

*NOTE: I am not a lawyer, just someone who is making sense of the law for people who don't understand it. Do not use this as legal advice.*

Law is defined by many precedents, mostly through previous cases that created rulings. These cases create a framework of philosophical thought that forms a legal maxim over time. Most attorneys tend to learn these maxims and doctrines in law [school](education.md), thereby reinforcing its [culture](people-culture.md).

Even in a fledgling nation, many lawyers will consult *other* nations that wrestled with the same issues instead of starting from scratch.

[Human nature](humanity.md) is relatively unchanging, so [laws](people-rules.md) seem to always have *some* overlap, even across vastly different [cultures](people-culture.md). It is worth indicating, however, that some of these doctrines are actually *[unethical](morality.md)* in many situations.

It's also worth indicating that there are many situations where opposing doctrines overlap, meaning precedent makes way for the judge's personal opinion.
