Interviews are less predictive of job performance than work samples,
job-knowledge tests, and peer ratings of past job performance.

Why predict something we can test? Why guess when we can know?

Use the (first) interview to collect information, not to make a decision.

One of the biggest problems is that too much emphasis is placed on the interaction between the candidate and the interviewer, and too little on the candidate's ability and motivation to do the job. This is the primary cause of hiring mistakes.

Interpersonal relationships and biases. This is how randomness enters the hiring process.
If you like a candidate, you tend to go into chat mode, ask easier questions, and look for information to confirm your initial impression.
If you don't like someone, you put up a defense shield, ask tougher questions, and try to end the interview quickly.
You go out of your way to find information to prove your initial belief that the candidate is incompetent.

There is a natural tendency to overemphasize the "getting the job" skills when assessing a candidate, rather than the person's ability to "do the job."

Remaining objective, overcoming the natural tendency to judge people based on first impressions, personality, and a few select traits.
Overcoming this problem will eliminate 50 percent of all common hiring errors.
Understanding real job needs will eliminate most of the rest of them.

Wait 30 minutes before making any decision about a candidate's ability to do the work.

To increase your objectivity during the interview, use the following six ideas:
1. Measure first impressions at the end of the interview. As
2. Disallow the yeslno decision unless the candidate is a complete dud. Make it a rule that you must suspend any decision for at least 30 minutes. During these 30 minutes, conduct a work-history review and get some details about the candidate's major accomplishments
3. Delay the decision by redefining the purpose of the interview. Use the interview just to collect information, not to make a decision.
4. Ask the same questions to all candidates.
5. Demand evidence before you accept gut feelings. Facts, examples, and details must be provided to justify a ranking, good or bad.
6. Make a "no" harder to justify than a "yes."

Interviewers need to train candidates to give complete information. If you leave it up to candidates to provide this information on their own, you're measuring interviewing and presentation skills, not job competency.

Organize the interview to assess competency and create opportunity at the same time. You do this by asking tougher questions, not by overselling or overtalking.

Top candidates must leave the interview knowing they have been assessed completely and properly. They must leave knowing the job offers a true career opportunity.

Making the job hard to earn but worthy of earning is how you hire top people.

When Teddy Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy, he purchased a used Brazilian merchant ship, the Nictheroy for $500,000, under the proviso that it must arrive under its own power within a very short time frame to a specific port. The contract didn't have any of the normal technical specifications. Roosevelt knew that if the ship couldn't travel the distance required by the date specified it was worthless.

The best had four common characteristics that were observable in the initial interview:
(1) self-motivation-everyone who achieved any level of success worked hard;
(2) an ability to motivate others-inspiring others to work hard, including peers, superiors, as well as their own team;
(3) achievement of results that were comparable to what needed to be achieved; and
(4) an ability to solve comparable job problems in real time.

Don't be seduced by affability and social assertiveness.

Another common error is to eliminate quiet people assuming there is a lack of energy.

"Of all of the things you've accomplished in your career, what stands out as most significant? Now could you go ahead and tell me all about it?"
Getting the correct answer to this question can tell you 65 percent to 75 percent of everything you need to make an accurate hiring decision.
The correct answer comes by fact-finding and getting complete details of the accomplishment.

What were the three or four big challenges you had to overcome?
What were the actual results obtained?
When did this take place and at what company?
How long did it take to complete the task?
What was the situation you faced when you took on the project?
Why were you chosen for this role?
Did you volunteer? Why?
What was your actual title?
Who were the people on the team?
What was your supervisor's title?
What technical skills were needed to accomplish the task?
What skills were learned?
Describe the planning process, your role in it, and whether the plan was met.
Provide details of what went wrong and how you overcame them.
What was your actual role in this project?
Give me three examples of where you took the initiative. Why?
What were the biggest changes or improvements?
What was the toughest decision you had to make?
How did you make it?
Was it the right decision?
Would you make it differently if you could?
Describe the environment-the pace, the resources available, your boss, and the level of professionalism.
What was the biggest conflict you faced?
Who was it with and how did you resolve it?
Give me some examples of helping or coaching others.
Give me some examples of where you really had to influence or persuade others to change their opinion.
How did you personally grow or change as a result of this effort?
What did you like the most and least?
In retrospect, what would you do differently if you could?
What type of recognition did you receive for this project?
Was it appropriate in your mind? Why or why not?

The key to using the most significant accomplishment (MSA) question is to ask it multiple times to observe long-term trends for individual, team, and job-related accomplishments.

If you want to better understand a candidate's thinking, planning, and job-specific problem-solving skills, just ask this question: "If you were to get this job, how would you go about solving _______ [describe a typical problem]?"

Don't accept generalities like "Created a new market," "Turned the department around," and "Developed a new procedure." Don't hesitate to ask for clarifying information.

"Please draw an organization chart and tell me how you built and developed this team, and describe the group's biggest accomplishment."

Determine whether the candidate's performance is on an upward trend, has flattened out, or is declining.

If you were to get the job what additional information would you need to know, and how would you go about accomplishing this objective?"

Eight steps provide a brief outline of the interviewing process:
1: Warm-up; do a quick overview and understand the candidate's motivation for looking. Use the first 5 to 10 minutes to gain a quick sense of the candidate, overcome temporary nervousness, and find out why the person is looking for a job.
2: Wait 30 minutes and Measure the impact of first impressions at the end of the interview. Use the interview to collect information, not decide competency. Decide competency by carefully evaluating the candidate's responses against real job needs. It's best to do this at the end of the interview or during a group deliberation where everyone shares information.
3: Conduct a comprehensive work history review. Go through every job and find out what the person accomplished, what the person didn't accomplish, the team the person worked with, why the person took the job, and any recognition they received. If you spend half of the opening interview on this, you'll know what you need to do in the second half.
4: Ask about major individual accomplishments. This is the MSA question. During the work history review, ask about the highlights of major accomplishments, then select ones that best meet your job needs to learn more about.
5: Ask about a major team accomplishment. This is the modification to the MSA question with the focus on team leadership. Spend a great deal of time on this, using specific team fact-finding follow-up questions.
6: Ask a problem-solving question. During this visualization question, start a discussion about a realistic job problem, not some hypothetical situation.
7: Recruit and close. Don't end the interview on a neutral note, but don't give the farm away either. Done properly, the close can be a useful way to begin the recruiting process without overselling.
8: Measure first impressions again.

Most Significant Accomplishment Question In Chapter 7, you discover how to modify the MSA question.
"Give me examples of when your personality has hurt your performance."
Don't ignore this part. Continue probing.
Be concerned if you get a run-around or some vague response.

Some Fatal Flaws Great communicator, with lots of self-confidence, but the person's management role doesn't seem to be growing. You might have found a great individual contributor or a consultant-type person, but a weak manager. Vague, superficial, or short answers when explaining critical issues, especially gaps in employment and why the person changed jobs, or failed to get the recognition deserved. Inconsistent track record-flat, down, roller coaster-that is always blamed on external circumstances. Lots of drive and ambition, but maybe too assertive. This could relate to ego problems, immaturity, or an inability to work in cross-functional teams. Too fast of a track record. The person might have been promoted beyond his capability. Extremes in any behavior-too analytical, too assertive, too friendly, or too persuasive. Usually this leads to problems regarding lack of flexibility or balance. Lots of energy, great personality, but answers are too general. This is the classic-lots of sizzle, but little substance. Lots of excuses about why things didn't happen, results weren't achieved, or why recognition didn't occur. A pattern of excuse making is the biggest clue that you're hiring the wrong person. If you observe any of these signs, you must get proof to overcome the potential concern.

Conduct the reference check just like the interview by getting specific examples to prove a generality and then by fact-finding.

You must conduct a background check on every candidate including degree verification, employment history, credit review, driving record, and criminal background. The cost is low and the protection is high.

First, never make an offer until it's accepted. Second, provide your candidate a compelling future vision that overwhelms the past.

Challenging questions are another way to create interest by pushing the candidate away to see whether the candidate pushes back. This is how you put candidates in the back seat.
For example, "While I like your background, I'm concerned you don't have enough experience in developing international accounting systems. Have I missed something? If not, can you describe something you've accomplished that you feel is most related to our needs?" This slight challenge increases the importance of this skill and requires the candidate to sell the interviewer. This approach, used judiciously throughout the interview, can increase a candidate's interest in a job. If the concern is valid, it demonstrates areas where the candidate can learn and grow if she were to get the job.

Use the following as the last question at the end of the first interview.
It's a must for all strong candidates:
"Although we're seeing some other fine candidates, I'm very impressed with your background. What are your thoughts now about this position?"

I told the candidate the salary range (only a slightly higher percentage over his current package) and the next steps in the evaluation process.
This consisted of a meeting with two board members on the East Coast, a half-day session with an industrial psychologist in the Midwest, and then a dinner with the chairman.
This was before the medical and drug test, and a final meeting with the CEO.
The candidate was very interested, but when he agreed to continue this arduous process, I knew the deal was almost done. 

Incremental theorists consider intelligence as something like strength. (Want to get stronger and more muscular? Start pumping iron.)
Entity theorists view it as something more like height. (Want to get taller? You're out of luck.)
- ENTITY THEORY?

If you believe intelligence is a fixed quantity, then every educational and professional encounter becomes a measure of how much you have.
If you believe intelligence is something you can increase, then the same encounters become opportunities for growth.
In one view, intelligence is something you demonstrate; in the other, it's something you develop.

The entity theory is a system that requires a diet of easy successes. In this schema, if you have to work hard, it means you're not very good. People therefore choose easy targets that, when hit, affirm their existing abilities but do little to expand them.

Ask every candidate the same questions and take extensive notes.

Check independent references. LinkedIn is very useful for this.

Keep the same members on your interview team. They get better and better at it.

Interviews test how well someone interviews.

Trust your gut. Chemistry is usually determined in the first few minutes of an interview.

'Never do business with anybody you don't like.' If you don't like somebody, there's a reason. Chances are it's because you don't trust them, and you're probably right.

As the official interview commences, as the starter's gun cracks and the race begins, ask all your questions at once. That's right. Put all your initial questions on the table up front. This strategy accomplishes three things. First, in a manner of speaking, you pass the baton. You've asked the questions, now the candidate must respond. Performance depends upon the candidate, not selling yourself and the organization. Second, and more importantly, this strategy directly confronts the most common problem in interviewing: not listening, and talking too much.

This technique forces you to listen.

Settle back and watch a candidate's behavior as well as listen to his or her words.

How do you recognize incompetence? What do you do about it?

How do you recognize excellence? What do you do with it? What about yourself would you like to improve most? What makes you lose your temper? Tell me about the last time it happened.

"Are you lucky?"

Henry Ford's favorite question, "Are you curious?"

Disingenuous questions.

"I'm just a legal and financial guy who never really understood the HR department. What exactly does a HR director do?" If the candidate could explain the job in detail, clearly and concisely, Larry went on to the next question. Watch out if the candidate spoke in jargon and buzzwords.

"How are you going to lose money for me?"

Three quarters of the way through the interview, give the candidate a task to perform. Not only does this demonstrate the candidate's behavior - it also breaks the monotony of most interviews.

The interviewer asks the candidate how she would market the new furniture and why.

"We have about five more minutes …" is a useful statement before closure. Pay attention to "By the way …," "Oh, one more thing …," and "I almost forgot …," which mean, "This is the most important thing I'm going to say."

Our strengths, in the extreme, may predict our weaknesses. Therefore ask candidates about their strengths, and consider what might exist on the other side.

If candidates can go into detail and depth about a subject, they probably have some expertise in that area. If not, the opposite is true. On the other hand, the key is to ask questions in your areas of expertise.

Use a pad with a line drawn down the middle. On one side of the page, make appropriate notes about what the candidate tells you regarding jobs, dates, strengths, weaknesses, etc. On the other side, note what you're thinking. Nothing is too minor to write down: questions, missing pieces, thoughts, feelings, likes, dislikes.

I have all candidates sign a release form, an at-will clause, and an arbitration agreement three times during the hiring process. They sign when they fill out an application, co-sign an employment agreement, and after they read our policy and procedures manual.

Before a candidate leaves my office I make a simple request. "Please call me back on Monday."

I say, "You'll probably have a few thoughts on the way home, maybe some questions, so let's talk for five minutes, even to touch base, if you're available by phone next week." Then we settle on a time and day.

Give finalist candidates a current project you're evaluating and ask for an analysis.

Give finalist candidates a post-interview project that evaluates attention to detail, as well as the ability to analyze problems and suggest solutions.

Meet the candidate's spouse or significant other.

What worries or anxieties does that person have about the candidate's possible job?

For the candidate worried about his sick child's health insurance, or about missing Little League practice with his son, or about his spouse's isolation, these issues need to be addressed, fully and satisfactorily, in advance of new employment.

Always have a final interview in which you talk about potential problems.

If you've not discovered any, you're missing something in the candidate's background.

Your goal is to address whatever difficulties might arise.

Give prospective employees a fifteen-minute psychological inventory.

Offer the assurance that there are no right or wrong answers.

I'm not as interested in the MBTI results, which identify a candidate as one of sixteen personality types, as I am in how long it takes to return the inventory, and how the person discusses the results, which we always do by phone or in a follow-up visit.

In our conversation afterward, the candidate has plenty of time to agree or disagree with the test results as it fits her personality. More significantly in terms of my task, does the candidate laugh? Does she elaborate on her independence? Her rigidities? Does she give examples? Do the results open up our discussion? Or does she clam up? Does the candidate think she can make an end run by saying, in all seriousness, as many candidates do, "Oh, I used to be like that, but I've really changed over the years."

## b interviewing - sivers - Hiring Smart - by Pierre Mornell - 4 references

Digging deeper - asking the candidate's references for other references,

Call references at what you assume will be their lunchtime - you want to reach an assistant or voice mail.

Jones is a candidate for (the position) in our company. Your name has been given as a reference. Please call me back if the candidate was outstanding."

If the candidate is outstanding or excellent, I guarantee that eight out of ten people will respond quickly and want to help. Take such a response as a green light.

If only two or three of the ten references selected by the candidate return your call, this message is also loud and clear. And yet: No derogatory information has been shared. No libelous statements have been made. No confidences or laws have been broken.

For all references, the higher you go up an organization, the more likely you are to get helpful information.

Tap the enormous wealth of publicly available data banks that may contain information on a candidate's driving and financial records, real estate dealings, court appearances, and litigation history. Perfectly legal, this is all public information and is readily available.

Always ask the candidate, "What am I likely to hear - positive and negative - when I call your references?"

Candidates always deserve the courtesy of explaining the peaks and valleys of their work history.

Call and ask about:
1. Technical Competence Can the candidate perform the required tasks? Can the university president raise money? Can the secretary spell? Can the receptionist handle phones? These are easy pitches, and references should be able to hit the ball out of the park.
2. Intelligence This topic can take a few seconds to consider. "On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate the candidate's intelligence?" Most references respond well to a ten-point scale for rating people.
3. People Skills Ask about the candidate's interpersonal skills. How does she get along with bosses? What about subordinates and peers? You'll usually get a ringing endorsement, but listen for silences, gaps, and omissions in this part of the conversation.
4. Motivation What motivates the candidate? Financial rewards? Meaningful assignments? A job well done? Pats on the back? Independence? All of the above? I have seen candidates decline offers because of relationships ("My fiance just accepted an offer in Salt Lake"), money ("My company just beat your offer"), and educational concerns ("My daughter's special school needs aren't available in your city"). How you structure your offer depends upon a person's motivations and your understanding of these motivations.
5. Everything Else Finally you should say, "Is there anything that I haven't asked?" Then listen carefully.

Here's a second format for phone references:
•  Did you like the person?
•  What did they fail at doing?
•  Reputation in the company?
•  How did they communicate?
•  Reputation in the industry?
•  How did they react to authority?
•  Reason for leaving?
•  Level of energy, drive?
•  What did they accomplish?
•  What would you change about the person if you could?

It helps enormously to have a colleague you can trust - or entrust - to tell you when you're making a mistake.

Do people like working for your candidate? Contact the people who currently work for him - secretaries and administrative assistants, direct reports and coworkers. Do they revere the candidate? Or do they fear or resent him? All employees, past and present, can help predict future behavior.

Give the candidate a longer assignment or hire a candidate on a temporary basis

Ask three questions at once. See if the candidate remembers the questions without reminders.

Give conflicting opinions early in the interview. Then see if the candidate agrees with both opinions throughout the interview.
