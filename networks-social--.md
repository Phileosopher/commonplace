- it's easy to frame a system that enhances base human motivations

The Problem with Subs
1. [thing] becomes popular and lots of non-[thing] followers join the most popular sub.
2. The dumbest, most not-worthy-to-talk-about-[thing] people exercise their
    voice without any sense of responsibility. Some of them become mods.
3. The original enthusiasts leave to another sub where the legitimate talk goes on.
This is a product of:
- No vetting process for people to speak freely
- No prioritization of veterans of the interest

Conversations
- People tend to have an idea flow:
    1. Stated idea/post/video/original_content
    2. Commenter makes good points
    3. Conversation get sidelined to whatever the best comments were
    4. Repeat #2 indefinitely until people lose interest

Instead of our going online to get our email, our email comes to us.

Content was never king, contact is.

- the only solution is a scarcity of information and/or a robust self-regulated permissions tracking (i.e., [my purpose] or [permissions])
