# Ecology (life on earth science) explained

The combination of [weather](science-earth-weather.md) and [geological](science-earth-land.md) formations create several major types of biomes across the earth:

- Aquatic biomes are underwater, with the dominant life being fish.
- Grasslands are warm and dry, with mostly smaller plants like grass.
- Forests have more moisture to support densely packed trees.
- Deserts are extremely dry (<20 inches of rain per year) but aren't necessarily hot.
- Tundra are freezing (-34° to -12° C), and are essentially an icy desert.

Most life on earth is underwater, and most air-breathing life are bugs.

Nothing is technically ever wasted by living beings. Every waste product of a living being is sustenance for another:

- Dung beetles and flies eat mammal excrement.
- Oxygen is toxic to flora and critical for fauna, and the reverse for carbon dioxide.
- Most odors we find unpleasant are because we've incubated a microbiome.
- The carbon released from cow flatulence came from plants in the first place, and is absorbed by plants later.

The scarcity of food creates a hard limit on how much and how varied life can thrive, and builds a type of food chain. A good rule of thumb is that, barring plant life, every organism requires 1,000 times its biomass to survive. Thus, a 5-kilogram herbivore requires 5,000 kilograms of plant matter and a 5-kilogram carnivore requires 5,000 kilograms of herbivore (i.e., 5,000,000 kilograms of plant matter). This is a giant reason why most predators don't primarily feed on other predators.

Generally, an ecosystem thrives when there's plenty of water and plenty of sunlight. This gives tons of plant life, which allows more animals to survive, meaning more speciation.

Sadly, climate science has been hijacked for [political reasons](politics-leftism.md), often pointing the blame for biome degradation on carbon. Increased carbon output, however, would trigger the negative feedback loop of increased plant life, thus preparing for more animals to offset the situation.

Over time, evolutionary adaptations change the epigenetics of organisms, but its scope and timing of the raw data leans heavily into the [phenomenology](symbols.md) of the data-viewer's perspective of the [unknown](unknown.md):

1. Atheist biologists believe all speciation came from a common ancestor, meaning it took millions of years and a few decades of reckless behavior by mankind could upset the delicate balance of existence we live in. Their timing for the conditions *frequently* moves around as they uncover new data.
2. Deist apologists have a wider range of beliefs, often believing that epigenetics creates speciation over a comparably smaller period of time, meaning adaptations can (generally) keep pace with mankind's adverse decisions.

New species are forming and dying all the time, and it's *very* difficult to keep up with all of them. Even with our technology, we can't entirely track all the flora (with many of them having [healing properties](body-health.md)), or all the derivatives of fauna. We're either ill-suited for the task, or the adaptations happen within generations (and not necessarily millions of years).
