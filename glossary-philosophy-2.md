## Aesthetics

Aesthetics - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of [beauty and taste](values-quality.md) values.

### What should we define as quality?

Aestheticism - Art should be beautiful, but not necessarily have a [purpose](purpose.md).

Formalism (aesthetics) - Things should be assessed by their inherent [created](creations.md) quality or qualities, not by the social or historical context that it was made in or how much it evokes a feeling.

Romanticism - Art is an emotional experience based on the consumers' [feelings](mind-feelings.md).

### How should we [create](mind-creativity.md)?

Classicism - Creating with a high regard for classical antiquity. A type of aesthetic absolutism. Contrasts against romanticism.

## Ethics

Ethics - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of [moral values](morality.md).

Cognitivism - Ethical statements can only be true or false. Opposite of non-cognitivism.

- Moral realism - Moral judgments express beliefs, which can only be true or false, so objective moral values exist.

Emotivism/Hurrah-boo theory - We make ethical statements based on our attitude about other statements, not as stand-alone ideas.

- Universal prescriptivism - Ethical statements always have a [purpose](purpose.md)-based part to them (e.g., "Killing is bad" always means "You shouldn't kill").

Expressivism - Moral statement (e.g., "wrongness", "goodness") never state real, metaphysical things. Thus, moral statements don't directly apply to truth. A middle ground between cognitivism and non-cognitivism.

Non-cognitivism - Ethical statements don't state facts or beliefs, so they're not matters of truth. Opposite of cognitivism.

Quasi-realism - Ethical statements aren't facts or beliefs, but do project emotional viewpoints as if they were real.

  - Singularitarianism - A [technological](technology.md) singularity with smarter-than-human intelligence is possible, and its coming must be preserved.
- Religious humanism - Religious rituals/beliefs harmonize with centering on human needs, interests, and abilities.
  - Christian humanism - Christian rituals/beliefs harmonize with centering on human needs, interests, and abilities.

Moral absolutism - We can judge moral questions against absolute standards, so some things are universally right/wrong irrespective of the context. Opposite of moral relativism.

Moral relativism - Presuming relativism (see above), morality is completely relative to indviduals or their [culture](people-culture.md). Opposite of moral absolutism.

Moral universalism/Universalism - Moral statements can apply universally. A middle ground between moral absolutism and moral relativism.
