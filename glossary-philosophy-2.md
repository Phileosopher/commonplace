## Axiology

Axiology - The branch of philosophy concerned with the concept of "[value](symbols.md)".

### How do we find purpose?

Absurdism - [Reality](reality.md) doesn't give us meaning, so we must accept that fact to find [purpose](purpose.md).

Nihilism - Absolutely everything has zero meaning, purpose, knowable truth, or value.

- Fatalism - Because determinism (see above) is true, thinking and doing anything is pointless to determine events.

Anthropomorphism - People tend to make human-like qualities for non-human things, including animals and deities.

Egoism (descriptively) - Everything people do consciously is inherently self-interested.

- Cynicism - Everyone is likely doing things for self-interested reasons.
- Psychological egoism - Everyone is always motivated by self-interest, consciously or subconsciously.

Freudianism - People psychologically repress experiences, it gets mixed up with sexual desire, and the very act of talking about bad experiences will often fix them.

Hedonism (descriptively) - People are motivated to seek pleasure and avoid pain.

### Where *should* we place our purposes?

Amor fati - Everything that happens is either good or at least necessary.

Anthropocentrism/Homocentrism - Human beings are the central reason/fact/purpose for the universe.

Immortalism - People are able to, at least theoretically, live forever.

Pragmatism - The practical use or consequences of something gives it [meaning](purpose.md) and truth.

Teleologism - There's an inherent design/purpose/principle/clarity in [reality's](reality.md) [patterns](symbols.md).

### How should we gain knowledge?

Coherentism (coherence theory of truth) - Someone's beliefs are only true if they're consistent with at least most of their other beliefs.

Coherentism (coherence theory of justification) - We can be [certain](understanding-certainty.md) of beliefs when they're consistent with at least most other beliefs that person has. Opposite of foundationalism.

Critical rationalism - To keep their value, all elements of [science](science.md) should be constantly criticized and questioned.

- Pancritical rationalism - All elements of science or truth should be constantly criticized and questioned, irrespective of any authority's justifications.

Deism - Reasoning is the only basis for knowledge. Thus, someone should only believe in God through reason, not tradition or gained insight.

Experientialism - Knowledge should be measured by experiences and first-hand accounts.

Foundationalism - We can be [certain](understanding-certainty.md) of beliefs when when they're based on self-evident basic beliefs that are based on non-belief things like experiences. Opposite of coherence theory of justification.

Functionalism - Since reductive materialism (see above) and logical behaviorism (see above) are wrong, we must consult [beliefs](understanding-certainty.md), [desires](purpose.md), and [emotions](mind-feelings.md) to [understand](understanding.md) people. The opposite of coherence theory of justification.

Falsificationism/Deductivism - Things are only [scientific](science.md) if there's a possibility they could be wrong.

Inductionism - We can use inductive reasoning on sets of information to create [theories and laws](lawsaxioms.md) to live by.

- Inductivism - The body of science is guided by previous scientific data, so it's always advancing toward truth.
- Psychologism - We can only grow in understanding via [philosophical study](philosophy.md).
- Scientism - We can best grow in understanding via [scientific study](science.md).

Instrumentalism - Knowledge doesn't need to be true, but must be useful.

Irrealism - We should swap phenomenalism (see above) with physicalism (see above) back-and-forth to understand things from the best perspective.

Kierkegaardianism - While truth may be absolute, finding the things that are subjective is the most important thing.

Methodological reductionism/Scientific reductionism/Occamism/Occam's razor - Explaining things should be continually reduced to the very simplest they can get, but no simpler.

- Greedy reductionism - Too many people reduce too much to too little.

Logical positivism - Philosophy should have the same rigor as [science](science.md), with strict rules for judging sentences as true, false, or meaningless.

- Comtism - All metaphysics and theology should be replaced by a hierarchy of [sciences](science.md) that start with [math](math.md) at the bottom to [sociology](groups-member.md) at the top.

Phenomenal conservatism - It's reasonable to assume things are as they appear unless there's a good reason to doubt it.

Skepticism - Doubt things that are held as knowledge.

- Postmodernism - Question absolutely everything.
- Probabiliorism - While knowledge is impossible, strong beliefs for likely things is a good idea. Opposed to probabilism.
- Probabilism - While knowledge is impossible, strong beliefs for practical things is a good idea. Opposited to probabiliorism.
- Pyrrhonism/Pyrrhonian skepticism - All things are unprovable, so learn to be comfortable knowing nothing for certain.

Structuralism - All elements of human culture are connected to a broader system.

- Post-structuralism - Since all elements of human culture are relative, there's no certain connection between any of them but there's a type of absolute to all of it.

Subjectivism - Things are subjective, and they either don't independently exist or it doesn't matter.

Syncretism - Contradicting things can be converged and unified into one harmonizing thought pattern.

Antinatalism - Giving birth is a morally bad thing.

Antinomianism - Nobody has to follow moral laws, typically referring to theology.

Asceticism - The [good life](goodlife.md) requires refraining from pleasurable things in this world.

Careerism - The greatest good comes in someone advancing their career, even if it risks them growing in other areas of life.

Humanistic naturalism - assuming naturalism (see above), humans are extensions of nature, so living naturally is the best way to live, which is against [industry](jobs-specialization.md) and [technology](technology.md).

Immoralism - Since morality doesn't matter, people should strive for an aesthetic (see below) that imitates living forever.

Intellectualism - Assuming rationalism (see above), reasoning is the best way to gain understanding.

Irrationalism - Science is inferior to intuition, and the ultimate transcendence of humanity comes through art and conquering aesthetics.

Randianism - People are best as heroic beings morally focused on [self-happiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md), focused on [productivity](success-3_goals.md) foremost, with their only absolute being [reason](logic.md). Often called objectivism by Randians.

Role ethics - People are best defined by their role in a [family](people-family.md).

Stoicism - Self-control of all types creates inner strength that builds harmony with the universe. Opposite of Epicureanism. Has largely been disproven by [psychology](science-social.md).

### Do we have free will?

Compatibilism/Soft determinism - Because we can [imagine](imagination.md) and [our environment](people-culture.md) profoundly impacts our decisions, determinism (see above) and free will can coexist. Opposite of incompatibilism.

Incompatibilism - Free will and determinism (see above) cannot [logically](logic.md) coexist.

Libertarianism (metaphysics) - Free will exists. Generally opposed to determinism.

Open theism/Openness theology/Free will theism - Since God and humans have free will, God's knowledge and providing are flexible.

Personalism - Only people are real, have value, and have free will.

### How can mankind be morally saved by an all-knowing God?

## Aesthetics

Aesthetics - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of [beauty and taste](values-quality.md) values.

### What should we define as quality?

Aestheticism - Art should be beautiful, but not necessarily have a [purpose](purpose.md).

Formalism (aesthetics) - Things should be assessed by their inherent [created](creations.md) quality or qualities, not by the social or historical context that it was made in or how much it evokes a feeling.

Romanticism - Art is an emotional experience based on the consumers' [feelings](mind-feelings.md).

### How should we [create](mind-creativity.md)?

Automatism/surrealist automatism - Spontaneously creating without any conscious self-censorship.

Classicism - Creating with a high regard for classical antiquity. A type of aesthetic absolutism. Contrasts against romanticism.

Expressionism - Creating by over-exaggerating to create an emotional effect. Contrasts to moral realism.

Modernism - Borrowing from humanism (see above), create with an emphasis on [science](science.md) and [technology](technology.md).

Primitivism - Pushing against intellectualism (see above), create with an emphasis on low-[technology](technology.md) experience and [feelings](mind-feelings.md).

Surrealism - Creating by using the element of surprise and unrelated things. Most of the creators tend to declare that they made a philosophical movement first and the works were just its byproduct.

Symbolism - Creating by using [representations](symbols.md) that carry particular meanings and patterns, which allow broader interpretation than literal representations would.

## Ethics

Ethics - The branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of [moral values](morality.md).

Cognitivism - Ethical statements can only be true or false. Opposite of non-cognitivism.

- Moral realism - Moral judgments express beliefs, which can only be true or false, so objective moral values exist.

Emotivism/Hurrah-boo theory - We make ethical statements based on our attitude about other statements, not as stand-alone ideas.

- Universal prescriptivism - Ethical statements always have a [purpose](purpose.md)-based part to them (e.g., "Killing is bad" always means "You shouldn't kill").

Expressivism - Moral statement (e.g., "wrongness", "goodness") never state real, metaphysical things. Thus, moral statements don't directly apply to truth. A middle ground between cognitivism and non-cognitivism.

Non-cognitivism - Ethical statements don't state facts or beliefs, so they're not matters of truth. Opposite of cognitivism.

Quasi-realism - Ethical statements aren't facts or beliefs, but do project emotional viewpoints as if they were real.

### Why are things good or bad?

Ascriptivism - Even if determinism (see above) is true, people are still responsible for their actions.

Consequentialism - The consequences from deicisions determine whether something was the right decision. Opposite of deontologism.

- Eudaimonism - Actions are good to the degree that they produce human flourishing.
- Situationalism/Situation ethics - Moral principles, while generally true, can be cast aside in certain situations if it's the most [loving](people-love.md) action.

Deontologism/Non-consequentialism - All moral values come from principles, so consequences never dictate morality. Opposite of consequentialism.

- Extrinsicism - External laws and precepts are more important than principles to determine moral conduct.
- Kantiamism - Morality is a matter of duty to "categorical imperatives", not [feelings](mind-feelings.md) or [purposes](purpose.md).

- Posthumanism - There's no special place for humanity in the universe.
- Secular/scientific humanism - Ethics and reason are the only legitimate means of gaining knowledge, with some supplementation from the arts.
- Transcendentalism - People must find a spiritual state to transcend their physical state.
  - Neo-Platonism - People must use philosophy to find a mystical union with the divine.
- Transhumanism/>H/H+ - [Science](science.md) and [technology](technology.md) can overcome human limitations and improve the human condition.
  - Extropianism - [Science](science.md) and [technology](technology.md) will someday let people live functionally forever.
  - Singularitarianism - A [technological](technology.md) singularity with smarter-than-human intelligence is possible, and its coming must be preserved.
- Religious humanism - Religious rituals/beliefs harmonize with centering on human needs, interests, and abilities.
  - Christian humanism - Christian rituals/beliefs harmonize with centering on human needs, interests, and abilities.

Moral absolutism - We can judge moral questions against absolute standards, so some things are universally right/wrong irrespective of the context. Opposite of moral relativism.

Moral relativism - Presuming relativism (see above), morality is completely relative to indviduals or their [culture](people-culture.md). Opposite of moral absolutism.

Moral universalism/Universalism - Moral statements can apply universally. A middle ground between moral absolutism and moral relativism.
