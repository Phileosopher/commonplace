# What surprise is

We experience the [feeling](mind-feelings.md) of surprise when things do not act according to how we [imagined](imagination.md), which means it equires several components:

1. An inaccurate or missing imagination of what will happen, which mandates the existence of [unknown](unknown.md) elements.
2. No [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) that we are in any [state of risk](safety.md).

## Surprise + other feelings

The absence of fear is critical, since the surprise will quickly develop into anxiety or terror if there is any form of concern.
