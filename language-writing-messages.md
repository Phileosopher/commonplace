# How to draft emails and text messages

For many, email is the most ubiquitous form of communication.

Brevity, while important in other writing, is critical in email:

- People get bombarded with emails, so brief statements make their lives easier.
- Fully summarize the purpose of the email on the Subject line.
- Many people use email inboxes for [productivity](success-4_routine.md), so only deliver one purpose with 1-2 points per email.

Avoid crucial mistakes:

- Attach any files as soon as you start the email.
- To avoid accidentally sending, don't enter the recipients until *after* you've edited.
- Don't send anything in an email you wouldn't say to them in-person.

Closely consider who should be on the "To", "Cc", and "Bcc" lines when selecting "Reply All":

- "To" recipients should respond in some way.
- "carbon copy" recipients don't need to do anything, but they should be informed of your message.
- "Blind carbon copy" is only useful to privately send a copy of a message to someone without anyone else knowing.

You can avoid many emails with a quick phone call or off-hand remark at a meeting.

Your greeting should match cultural expectations:

- "Hello" - first-time professional greeting only
- "Hi" - strangers, professional contacts, and non-professional introductions
- "Hey" - familiar professional contacts, loose acquaintances
- No greeting - closer friends

Carefully choose your words to create the right tone:

- Barring unusual circumstances, limit emails to 5 sentences and 150 words.
  - Most people read emails on mobile devices, so lengthy emails are daunting.
- If you're ever vague, you'll confuse people and create more emails.
  - Emotions *will* be misunderstood in an email's limited context, so don't express them.
- Keep the tone respectful and courteous.
  - Avoid using text message language (e.g., LOL, JK, BRB).
  - To say something is funny, simply say "that's funny!"
- If the email needs explaining or any of the above rules feel inappropriate for your message, make a phone call or write a letter instead.

Break out ideas with spacing and bullets.

If the conversation grows too long, start a new email with a new subject line.

Since it's a summary of your email, take extra time to craft the subject line.

Conclude with a clear "[call to action](marketing.md)" about what they should do with your information.

To make people [important](people-3_respect.md), always respond promptly to their emails.

Don't over-assert yourself with messages to strangers:

- Only ask for advice with guided questions, and never ask for direct feedback.
- Ask if they know a good source of insight on a topic, but never ask them to introduce you to specific people in their networks.
- Don't request a phone call or an in-person meeting within the next few days.
  - Since you're requesting, you must be more flexible to their needs.
  - Don't name times for a meeting.

Watch for uneven power dynamics in messages and adapt accordingly:

- One person is making typographical errors, skipping punctuation, or ignoring capital letters while the other doesn't.
- One person takes a while to reply while the other doesn't.
  - Reply quickly and relatively infrequently.
  - If you need more time to reply, send a quick reply that you'll get back to them.
- One person is responding to long, well-written messages with much shorter responses.
  - The ideal length of a message varies on its industry and context.

Use email technology efficiently:

- Always spell-check and review everything before you send.
- Use a "delay send" or "scheduled send" to deliver a message at a more appropriate time.
  - Consider their time zone and likely [sleep cycle](sleep.md) when choosing a time.
- Your email address and email signature should convey the image you want.
- Since they annoy the recipients and make you seem like you have [trust issues](trust.md), avoid electronic return receipts.

Online chats require writing skills as well:

- Even when you're writing off-the-cuff, your messages carry implications.
- When greeting, say "hello", but follow with your question or idea.
  - Otherwise, they'll have to respond with "hello" back, which may add upwards of days or weeks before the conversation moves forward.
  - Generally, only use emojis and icons to enhance an existing statement you're making.
  - Make sure the recipient will understand your meme or cultural reference.
