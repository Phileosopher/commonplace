## Reputation

A person's reputation is the composite of everyone else's [image](image.md) of that person. It's extremely fickle and chaotic because it's what other people [feel](mind-feelings.md) about someone, which changes constantly.

All reputation is nothing but [sentiments](mind-feelings.md) about past events. Those sentiments, however, are [powerful](power.md), and define entire [cultures](culture.md).

Because reputation is built around feelings, it's rarely [rational](logic.md). At its farthest extreme, a celebrity will make one social media remark that generates 1,500 comments, with each person feeling their single comment will [make a difference](power-influence.md).

Reputations prove beforehand to others about what they should [expect](imagination.md). It usually indicates what someone [has legitimately done](mind-creativity-results.md) and implies how much they [understand](understanding.md). While a reputation is always interpersonal, a sufficiently advanced society will create a set of data-generated reputations in different domains (e.g., [credit score](money-2_debt.md), [insurance score](insurance.md)).

The limit of [power](power.md) from a reputation is what that entire [group](groups-large.md) can provide, so most people [pursue](purpose.md) at least some reputation with others.

To [communicate](language.md) a reputational image is *highly* contextual and will bestow honor or shame on a person depending on the situation. Most of the value people feel from their honor and shame comes through a third party observing it, which is why [group leaders](groups-small.md) have more [power](power.md) to bestow honor and shame than [members](groups-member.md).

To be famous is to have so much attention on you that you have no medium to sufficiently respond to the people who [communicate with you](people-conversation.md).

Discrimination
--------------

When we interpret favor or shame immediately as part of our bias, we're discriminating. These values can include favoring race, [age](/maturity/), [gender](/gender/), or implied [social class](/classes/). Unless we [analyze](/logic/) what people say and ignore their reputation, we're *always* [unfairly](/justice/) biased.

We discriminate *all the time* for many reasons:

- What we [imagine](/imagination/) others may think
- [Past pain](/ptsd/) that may not have present implications
- What we perceive others may be able to [do](/results/), often defined by their [aptitude](/humanity/), [status](/groups-member/) in specific [groups](/groups-small/), or our [understanding](/understanding/) of their [maturity](/maturity/)
- [Physical attractiveness](/gender/), distinguishing features like clothing, and [hygiene](people-2_image.md)
- Even when we've tried to remove bias, we often discriminate on [ideas](/values/) alone as theories without any consideration for [history](/trends/)

A stereotype is [habitual](/habits/) and [unfair](/justice/) discrimination. Because we're not conscious of it, we make silly overgeneralizations that lose any sense of [logic](/logic/). People can often address it with [humor](/humor/), but when people have suffered [pain](/ptsd/) from the stereotype (or [others can benefit from it](/leftism/)), they'll miss the joke.

Stereotypes are inherently amoral because we're not aware of them when we build them. However, if we persist with them after we're made aware, we risk committing [evil](/evil/).

Sneaky
------

Because of how much [power](/power/) a reputation can give, people will [work hard](/results/) to [distort and tweak their image](/image-distortion/). Most people do it a little (which is essentially [lying](people-lying.md)), but some people are experts at claiming honor and redirecting shame.

When people are [skillful enough with others](people-4_friends.md) or [familiar enough with someone](/friendship/), it's *impossible* to hide reality from them. Since most of our actions are made of [habits](/habits/), and [feelings](/feelings/) flavor our habits, any alteration to hide [reality](/reality/) from someone who knows what to [expect](/imagination/) will betray their ulterior [motive](/purpose/).
