## Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi Foundation not-for-profit aims their Raspberry Pi at young people.

- [The Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) comes in a variety of forms, but are almost all designed to be as easily accessible as possible.
- Prices for basic Pis are $35-70, though there are much smaller ones now that run for $4.

With respect to hardware, a Raspberry Pi simply needs peripherals (keyboard and screen).

There are now units that come with a built-in keyboard, meaning that it only needs a screen to setup.

Pis run on [Linux](computers-os-unix.md) with a specialized distro for it, so they work with a vast variety of [programming languages](computers-languages.md).

## Arduino

Ivrea Interaction Design Institute aims their Arduino at giving non-technical students a chance to quickly and affordably prototype what they want.

- [The Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products) is a bit weaker than the Pi, but doesn't have the overhead or complexity of an entire [operating system](computers-os.md), so it's easier to scale than the Pi.
- Prices for Arduinos range from $10-100.

Unlike the Pi's standalone setup, Arduinos need another computer to program them.

- Programming is in C/C++, or you can get sophisticated and run other languages on it, but it has limitations and not many people do it.

## PINE64

[PINE64](https://www.pine64.org/) directs their efforts toward affordable, open-source, ready-to-use devices.

- Like the others, they have single board computers, as well as a clusterboard for [distributed systems](computers-distsys.md).

As of right now, they have open-source consumer devices like a laptop, phone, and smart watch.

- They also have an affordable IP camera and a soldering iron for more specific projects.

Pine devices are as-is devices with almost no hardware tinkering required.

## ODROID

Hardkernal designs a few types of low-end, small devices.

- ODROID is a tiny circuit board in the spirit of the Raspberry Pi.
- ODROID-GO has a tiny screen with it and is designed as a portable [emulator console](computers-distsys-vm.md).

## ESP32

Espressif has [the ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32), which is a small, cheap, and WiFi-enabled microchip.

## Others

Along with all the above, many vendors sell [very cheap "microcontrollers" for as little as $1](https://jaycarlson.net/microcontrollers/) that allow plenty of opportunities for expanding and scaling a computer's purposes.

Further, old computers and computer parts also have plenty of reusability if you're willing to engage in a little [break-fix](fix.md) and hardware diagnosis:

- Obsolete desktop computers and laptops
- [Printers](engineering-printers.md) and [scanners](computers-ocr.md)
- Old [networking](networks-computer.md) equipment like routers, modems, telephones, and fax machines
- Old [cameras](engineering-camera.md), especially webcams
- While they take more work to fiddle with, most old smartphones are a complete computer with other features like a camera, accelerometer, and GPS.
  - Generally, for reusing, you'll want to focus your efforts on the parts that can be reused the most (which is typically the phone's processor and memory).
