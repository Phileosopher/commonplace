Ways to protect yourself from payment fraud:
- Pay it safe: Since most P2P apps don't allow you to cancel a transaction, treat payments like cash, and only send funds to those you know and trust.
- Take your time: If someone is pushing you to act quickly with a P2P payment, it could be a red flag.
- Use your security settings: Enable settings within the P2P applications, such as multifactor authentication (also known as two-factor authentication),
- Let your financial institution help: Fraud alerts can automatically notify you of activity, and always contact your financial institution immediately if you suspect something is wrong.
- Be aware of phishing: Fraudsters might try to access your account by posing as your financial institution or a P2P company. If someone calls you unexpectedly and claims to be from your financial institution, it is best to hang up and call your financial institution at the number printed on your statement rather than the number that called you.
- Use unique passwords: Use different passwords for P2P apps and other sites, avoid sharing your passwords with others, and consider a password manager tool if you have trouble remembering passwords.

FROM CHARLES SCHWAB
- Stay vigilant. You can help prevent fraud with these simple steps:
    - Hover over links in an email to confirm they are from legitimate sources before clicking on them and do not dial the number in an email or pop-up alert.
    - Ensure your computer systems, online browsers, and mobile devices are updated with the latest versions of software.
    - Establish unique and strong login credentials. At Schwab, you can create a password or passphrase. Be sure to create a password that you use only with Schwab and nowhere else.
    - Change your password periodically to ensure your security if you have not changed your password for a long period.
    - Use two-step verification, which will provide you a unique security code each time you access your accounts. Visit the Security Center tab to update your two-step verification settings.
    - Review your existing passwords and ensure they are updated to strong and unique passwords if they have not been updated or changed for a long period of time.
    - Manage your alert settings through [Schwab.com](http://schwab.com/) or the Schwab mobile app. When possible, enable "Push" notifications for real-time activity alerts.



Here are seven tips to know you’re working with Schwab:

Look out for unsolicited offers.

We’ll never contact you directly using a messaging app (like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp) to offer unsolicited investment opportunities.

Check before giving remote access to your computer.

Before giving someone remote access, especially if they proactively contact you saying there's an issue or suspected fraud, call the phone number listed below or on Schwab's public site to verify you’re speaking with Schwab.

Avoid clicking suspicious links.

Don’t click on links sent through social media or text unless you’re confident they’re real, especially if they promise lucrative investment opportunities.

Use caution with “special” opportunities.

Be wary of investment opportunities based on alleged “insider” or confidential information, as these could involve illegal or fraudulent activities.

Beware of urgency and pressure tactics.

Be cautious of communications urging immediate action or pressuring you to invest quickly with promises of guaranteed or unusually high returns. Remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Do your research and verify.

Before committing to anything, call us at the number below or through one of our official channels first to verify the legitimacy of the information and the individuals involved.

Stick to our official channels.

Always use our verified, secure communication channels for all transactions and inquiries. These can be found at schwab.com/contactus.

## Preliminary steps to avoid accidentally running a malware infected file


For software, the best places are going to be private trackers, as they tend to have staff members dedicated to checking the validity of torrents uploaded. rutracker is a large public tracker that is well-known for their music and software catalogue. If you're going to download software and you don't want to make the effort to join private trackers, rutracker is one of the best public tracker to use. Warezbb is a great board for software (if you can catch it when it's not down).

If you're going to download software/games, [definitely avoid the piratebay](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/). They have an immense amount of fake torrents and it's just not worth the risk of wading through their crap heap.

If you're going to download other torrents that aren't software, you can at least take preliminary measures that you're not running a fake file, even if you download from TPB.

The following examples use video files as an example, and while it is wholly possible to include malware in anything, malware in files like video files, music files, aren't a likely scenario. Even then, they would have to target a specific program (ie. a specific video player) to attempt to exploit in order to tailor a video file with malware only meant to be able to run on such a video player. The main idea here is to use up-to-date programs in order to prevent being a victim of most of these exploits.

If you're looking for video, obviously an exe file is not what you're looking for, so that's an obvious candidate for the trash bin. Other attack vectors include intentionally bloated videos that simply contain messages like "download `x` codec to properly view this video". In the download folder there may be a link or executable to install the supposed "codecs", which will obviously be malware.

SFX files may also be used to spread malware, as they are "self extracting executables", but by all intents and purposes treated as executables themselves. Do not run software if you do not trust the source.

Pay close attention to the file icon to make sure that it's recognized as a video file instead of anything else. If you have file extensions hidden, files such as `NotAVirus.mp4.exe` will simply show as `NotAVirus.mp4`, but they'll show the executable icon because windows sees the real file extension. Make sure you [unhide file extensions.](https://support.winzip.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011457948-How-to-configure-Windows-to-show-file-extensions-and-hidden-files)

Be on the lookout for RTL naming schemes that may make a filename of `filename.3pm.exe` be displayed as `filename.exe.mp3`: [Further Reading.](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/spoof-using-right-to-left-override-rtlo-technique-2/)

Another attack vector includes windows shortcuts, which will provide (as an example) a supposed `videofile.avi` video file but it's actually shortcut to a batch/powershell other type of script, and won't show as such even with file extensions shown. The file icon may also be one similar to that of a video player's, but if you pay close attention to it, you'll notice an arrow in the corner that indicates it's a shortcut. Also note the `file type` column in file explorer showing `Shortcut`: <https://i.imgur.com/e0Cgeje.jpg>. In the screenshot, the tiny filesize is a giveaway, but these attack vectors typically 0-byte pad the file to inflate the filesize, in an attempt to make it look more convincing. [Some reading on this](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/rising-trend-attackers-using-lnk-files-download-malware/) [TrendMicro]. This type of download will never not be malware.

Use proper video players instead of the default windows media player: MPC, MPV, VLC.

Popular video file types will be avi, mp4, mkv. `wmv`, `wma` video/audio containers' specs allow for scripts, which windows media player can try to run.

Not very common, but `.scr` files are "screensaver setter" files that are actually just executables. Avoid these.
