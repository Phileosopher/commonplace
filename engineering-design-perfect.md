Making things perfect is not really possible. This represents a conceptual Platonic world of existence where something could theoretically be built perfectly.

## Experience

Firstly, before undertaking this endeavor, make sure you understand the realm you're working in intimately. It can't simply be a parallel understanding from a related discipline. You need to have direct hands-on experience with building and designing that specific thing.

You also can't get bored with the project. Getting bored guarantees people will feel it through the end result.

## Design

Make sure it doesn't violate *any* [intellectual property](legal-ip.md) laws, not even slightly. If it's derived from any inspiration, attribute complete credit to that design.

The design should be durable, flexible, efficient, fast, and clean. It should also be modular to add for all possible things you may or may not think of, including compatibility with all other related or nearby objects.

The manufacture of the design should be the same as the design, with zero waste or pollution.

## Centralization

If there are any components that must be managed from a central source, make sure *all* control components are eternally online. Have redundancy to make sure it never fails, and make flawless security in it to protect it from [being hacked or creatively reused](hacking.md).

If a human must keep track of it, make sure there are at least 2-3 other humans who can maintain it, and do it on a revolving cycle (such as board-appointed voting) to prevent fraud or misuse. Keep a regulatory committee available to prevent those people from [abusing their power](power-types.md).

## Deviations

The system should have opportunities for adaptability by the users. Have a huge portion of the project (if not all of it) be [open-source](legal-ip-floss.md) components that permit the public to review the work.

If any open-source forks improve on the original design, executives will be required against their ego to adopt the improvements. If, for whatever reason, the improvements can represent a detriment elsewhere, then multiple product lines will be introduced, but all communicated expertly to make sure everyone knows it's the same product.

## Naming

The naming conventions of spun-off lines will not have arbitary labeling, and will be vastly different in titling (e.g., no ParaPlus and ParaPlus DX). Future iterations of a product will have logically-flowing titles that correspond to alphabetic or numeric sequence (e.g., Yend 5 advances to Yend 6, Drib Model B goes to Drib Model B2).

If there is a spinoff idea, that naming convention will stand on its own. If the spinoff becomes more [popular](trends.md), always maintain the connection to the original idea in the name.

## Identification

Every item in the system needs a unique form of identification. This identifier must *not* be attached to reality whatsoever in any other way, or it will face a breakdown in usefulness.

The list of possible ID numbers must vastly outnumber the number of potential users/devices/components by a dramatically exponential factor to reduce the chances of running out of IDs and having to refactor a new ID system later.

The IDs will increase by a predictable increment from product to product. There will be a gap in the middle of each iteration of ID to compensate for any individual product's rebuilding/redesign.

## Use

People should be able to intuitively understand what and how to do things without needing instructions. Any instructions are optional for the people who want them, and it will be worded without any unclear language.

If any [documentation](language-writing-documentation.md) *is* necessary, it must be clarified articulately and clearly enough for a child to understand it, without the use of any engineering or other trade-related jargon. There will be a publicly-accessible knowledge base online and included with the product that gives absolutely *every* component necessary to make the product, including all schematics for all components.

However, none of the documentation will give information that may violate user privacy or permit the user to violate others' privacy or commit immoral or unlawful acts.

## Materials

All parts are made of the highest possible quality materials, and sourced from the most reliable vendors. The vendors must exist in a free country with an internationally competitive pay rate, and the parts will adhere to the highest standards of excellence.

Replacing parts will be a seamless part of the product's design, and parts will be easy to acquire from the vendor.

## Organizational support

There will be a 24/7 support line, without phone trees and a prioritization system that prevents ever placing someone on hold. All employees will have free time and will be encouraged to find ways to improve the product. Any of their inventions will be *their* intellectual property, and they will receive fair royalties for it.

If there ever is a hold time exceeding 15 minutes, more staff will be trained and brought in to accommodate the increased demand, as well as an investigative review of whether the product itself is consistently failing at anything whatsoever.

If any defects are found, nobody will be blamed, but the engineers and designers responsible will be more closely monitored, and repeat offenders will be promptly reassigned to positions that more accurately fit their natural skills.

In the same way, bad managers will be reassigned to roles that more fit their personality, such as marketing.

The entire organization will be horizontally emphasized, where competence defines advancement in the company more than popularity.

## Requirements

The demands to create this only require changing a few key components of human nature:

- The only people who work with this have a passion for the product and, more importantly, the people who use the product. [Love](people-love.md) for other people will drive the work.
- The culture of the organization will be open-ended, constantly permitting new ideas to propagate. Any leadership who reject new ideas which may have value will be publicly demoted. This is possible with elections, assuming that everyone in the organization can't be [swayed](mind-bias.md) by a convincing argument.
- All bad actors won't be permitted to act. This will be reinforced by a society surrounding the organization that shuns devious or morally corrupt behavior. We still have yet to see [one of these societies](politics-perfectsociety.md).

Also, this entire system must be open-ended enough to accept any changes I haven't thought of. Human nature must be inherently good in such a way as to prevent this system getting perverted beyond repair.

If these requirements can't be met, don't bother, since you'll make a more horrifying arrangement than the [free market](economics.md) already has, and you may as well aim for "good enough".
