# Sleep while traveling

When we are somewhere that feels new, our brain stays alert through the night to protect us.

1. It's much harder to fall asleep in an unfamiliar environment.
2. Gradually, the brain will lose its always-alert state and adapt to deep sleep.
3. Frequent travelers will typically grow accustomed to constantly new sleeping environments.

Accommodate yourself to prevent travel insomnia:

- Choose a low-traffic area in a hotel, like the end of a hallway or a top-level room.
- Bring blackout curtains or blinds.
- Ask for or bring a white noise machine, earplugs, and an eye mask.
- Bring a pillow with a scent and feel you're accustomed to.
- To avoid upsetting the stomach, eat a low-carb, light dinner that isn't spicy or fatty.
- To avoid thinking about the near future, pack and plan for the next day and put away all electronics.
- Take a hot bath to relax.
- [Meditate](awareness-meditation.md) and breathe deeply.

If you're only traveling for a day or two, keep your sleep pattern in your home time zone.

Jet lag is almost guaranteed for trips lasting more than a few days, but you can mitigate its effects:

- Drink a natural [tea](fun-tea.md) like yerba maté, ginkgo biloba, or ginseng.
- Take a warm shower in the morning.
- Spend the day outside, ideally in the morning between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.
- Exercise in the early morning or late afternoon.
- Wear “re-timer” glasses that emit a soft green light.
- Nap for up to 20 minutes at a time to get back on schedule.
- Avoid substances that can interfere with your sleep, such as [coffee](fun-coffee.md) or [alcohol](fun-alcohol.md).
- Take a cold shower in the evening.
