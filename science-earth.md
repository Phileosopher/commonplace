# Earth science explained

We don't know exactly how this planet was formed. This is hotly contested based on philosophical cosmological beliefs:

1. Astronomers say gravity drew the elements from various stars, which clumped together over a very long time until it eventually became what we recognize now.
2. [Religious](religion.md) people say God formed the Earth as a finished product.

Obvious questions that remain unanswered:

- How much can we damage the ecosystem before it stops self-healing?
