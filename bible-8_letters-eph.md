## 2

God is playing the long game:

1. Saving many people by grace.
2. Reconciling the two domains of Gentile outsider and Hebrew lineage.
3. Using his humanity to bridge the gap.
4. For the purpose of showing His grace in future ages.

This means that God is less concerned about worldly gain than eternal gain.

In that sense, prosperity for us in this life is trivial. It's like asking for nicer food at military basic training.
