# Housekeeping tricks

Housekeeping is [organization](organization.md), but with more cleaning.

Cleaning is removing debris and filth from things with the three major purposes of maintaining a visual [appearance](people-image-why.md), odor control, and hygiene.

Cleaning is easier if you understand how pH works:

Every chemical has an acidity or alkalinity, on a scale from 1 to 14.

- 0.0 - Hydrochloric Acid
- 0.3 - Battery Acid (Sulfuric Acid)
- 1.5-3.5 - Gastric Acid (Stomach Acid)
- 2.0-2.6 - Lemon Juice
- 2.8 - Vinegar
- 2.5-4.5 - Soft Drinks
- 3.3-3.9 - Apples
- 4.0 - Wine & Beer
- 4.2 - Orange Juice
- 4.5 - Tomatoes
- <4.9 - Acid Rain
- 5.0 - Boric Acid
- 5.0 - Black Coffee
- 5.0-5.5 - Clean Rain
- 6.1 - Aloe Vera
- 6.2 - Corn
- 6.5-8.0 - Drinking Water
- 6.7 - Milk
- 7.0 - Pure Water
- 7.2 - Tea
- 7.4 - Human Blood
- 8.0 - Sea Water
- 8.4 - Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)
- 9.0 - Egg Whites
- 9.3 - Borax
- 10.0 - Laundry Detergent
- 10.2 - Milk of Magnesia
- 11.5 - Ammonia
- 12.0 - Soapy Water
- 12.4 - Lime (Calcium Hydroxide)
- 12.6 - Chlorine Bleach
- 13.5 - Lye (Soap Ingredient)
- 14.0 - Sodium Hydroxide

Acid and base combinations range from harmless neutralizing to creating fatally poisonous gases, usually as severe as the difference between the substances' pH and how quickly they mix.

- Generally, reactions' power comes from the difference in substances' pH and the speed they mix:

Acids break apart in water and form positively charged hydrogen ions.

Bases break apart in water and form negatively charged hydroxide ions.

When cleaning, try to take advantage of either acids' or bases' pH compared to what you're cleaning.

Like any other [productive task](success-4_routine.md), starting to clean is more work than continuing it, so the first 5 minutes are more difficult than the 2 hours after it.

## Every home needs routines to maintain it

Weekly tasks must be done frequently, though not every week:

- Clean out all food preparation appliances used in the last week (toaster, blender, stove/oven, microwave, grill).
- Clean the outside of the refrigerator.
- Wipe down all kitchen and bathroom surfaces.
- Vacuum, sweep, and mop all indoor flooring.
- Clean bathroom toilets, sinks, showers, and shower curtains.

Monthly tasks usually require more work, but are less frequent:

- Clear out the refrigerator and wipe it down inside.
- Wash the trash cans and sprinkle baking soda at the bottom.
- Dust the furniture and tops of surfaces.
- Wash the [autos](autos.md).
- Prune all foliage.
- Pull the hair out of the vacuum's spinning brush to prevent it from damaging the motor.
- Water all indoor plants.

Every 3-4 months:

- Clean the inside and outside of all windows and mirrors.
- Clean the stove underneath by popping off the top.
- Polish all furniture.

  - Prepare receipts for taxes.
  - When you start using the air conditioner more than the heating unit, adjust the ceiling fan blades to push downward.
- At the start of fall, have a professional inspect and clean the fireplace and check the heating unit.
- Winter has a few potentially critical tasks:
  - When you start using the heating unit more than the air conditioner, adjust the ceiling fan blades to push upward.
  - Check water lines, insulation, and anything else vulnerable to cold.
  - Disconnect all hoses from hose bibs, drain, and store.
  - Drain all exterior faucets and protect them with covers.
  - Confirm access to all water supply cutoff valves in case of burst pipes.
  - Turn off and drain the irrigation systems.

Every other year or as needed:

- Change out furniture to accommodate new lifestyles.

## Optimize your cleaning

Maintaining a house isn't that hard if you know a few tricks.

Continually take the trash out to improve your overall cleanliness:

- Place extra trash bags at the bottom of the cans to change out bags quicker.
- Reuse a cereal box as a car trash can.
- Reuse a wet-wipes container or empty tissue box to hold plastic bags.
- Drill several holes in the bottom of a trash can to avoid suction when pulling the bag out.

Store the cleaning solutions together in a secure area or in a caddy:

- Use a hanging shoe rack on the inside of a closet.
- Hang a curtain rod under a sink for spray cleaners.

Prepare your cleaning supplies before you start:

- Set your cleaning supplies where you'll use them.
- Route water for buckets from the sink with a clean dustpan or pool noodle.

Clean in the right order to maximize efficiency:

- Since dust settles downward and will be pushed down from higher surfaces, clean from top to bottom.
- Dust first and vacuum last.
- Clean from left to right to not miss any areas.
- Clean the outer walls first and then the furniture in the center.
- When possible, skip vertical surfaces that haven't collected dust.

Let cleaning solutions soak on objects for them to chemically decompose the particulates.

Use a more efficient or heavier tool if you have a hard time reaching somewhere.

Use both hands to clean everything quicker.

Do the same thing every time to speed up cleaning.

If you must clean for company, only clean visually apparent things:

- Clear all countertops.
- Close all open doors, drawers, and toilet seats.
- Clean the guest bathroom mirror.
- Hide dirty dishes in the oven.
- Hide the clean clothes behind a throw blanket and decorative pillows on furniture nobody will sit on.
- Gather scattered papers up and wrap them with a rubber band.

Cyclodextrin, the active chemical behind Febreze, is the only chemical available that actually *removes* odors from the air and surfaces. All others simply cover them up.

## Cleaning doesn't have to be expensive

You can clean most surfaces with a few pre-made solutions with a few bases:

### Laundry

To avoid an uneven load in a top-down washing machine, place the heaviest items at the bottom of the basin or bundle them into a loose ball to avoid them wrapping around the center post.

Throw a dry towel in with a wet load in the dryer to cut the drying time in half.
