# Design rules

This is a list of rules generally necessary for good [design](engineering-design.md). Many of them dovetail with our [cognitive biases](mind-bias.md).

Least Astonishment Principle - a design should match a user's experience, expectations, and mental models

Information filtering

- Aesthetic-usability effect - we often perceive [aesthetically pleasing](values-quality.md) design as being more usable
- Anchoring bias - we tend to rely heavily on the first piece of information they see
- Attentional bias - we filter our thoughts based on what they're paying attention to
- Banner blindness - we tune out what they repeatedly see
- Centre-Stage Effect - we tend to choose the middle option in a set of items
- Cognitive load - we require a certain amount of effort to understand things, which changes based on how the information is presented
- Confirmation bias - we tend to look for evidence that confirms what they already think
- Contrast - our attention draws to higher visual weights
- Empathy gap - designers *severely* underestimate how much emotions influence user behaviors
- Expectations bias - we are influenced by their own predetermined expectations
- Fitts' law - things are easier for us to interact with when they're large and close
- Framing - how information is presented determines how users decide
- Hick's Law - more options makes decisions harder
- Isolation/von Restorff effect - when showing multiple items, the most different of them will stand out the most
- Juxtaposition - elements tend to get grouped when they're similar
- Law of proximity - elements tend to get grouped when they're near each other
- Mental model - we have a preconceived opinion on how things work
- Priming - previous perceptions will influence someone's [decision](people-decisions.md)
- Progressive disclosure - we are less overwhelmed from complex features if they're shown later
- Selective attention - we filter out things when they're focused on other things
- Spark effect - we are more likely to take actions when they're small
- Survivorship bias - we neglect things that don't make it past a selection process
- Tesler's Law of Conservation of Complexity - everything has a certain amount of complexity you can't remove, and making it simpler only makes it more complicated
- Visual hierarchy - there's a natural order of how we see things

Information presentation

- Decoy effect - create an option that's easy for us to discard
- Discoverability - different elements have differing difficulty for us to discover them
- External trigger - information on what we should do next is inside the prompt itself
- Feedback loop - elements communicate what happens after we take action
- Nudge - subtle hints affect our decisions
- Occam's razor - All things equal, a simpler thing is better
- Provide exit points - invite the user to leave the software at the right moment
- Shaping - incrementally reinforce actions to get closer to a target behavior
- Signifiers - elements can communicate what they will do
- Visual anchors - elements can guide our eyes

Finding meaning

- Authority bias - we give weight to an authority figure's opinion

- Halo effect - we judge the entirety of something based on one of its traits
- Hindsight bias - we overestimate their ability to have predicted an outcome
- Law of common region - we perceive elements as groups if they share a clearly defined boundary
- Law of Pr√§gnanz - Since it takes the least amount of effort, we distill vague things ibe linked tonto a simpler and more complete form
- Law of similarity - we tend to perceive a relationship between similar-looking elements
- Law of uniform connectedness - we see visually connected elements as more related than elements with no connection
- Noble edge effect - we prefer [organizations](groups-large.md) that appear socially responsible
- Parkinson's law - we expand tasks to fill in extra time
- Scarcity - we value things more when there's a limited supply of them
- Self-initiated triggers - we are more likely to interact with self-made prompts
- Singularity - we care disproportionately more about an individual than about a group
- Skeuomorphism - we adapt more easily to things that look like real-life objects
- Social proof - we adapt our actions from what other people do
  - Survey bias - we tend to skew survey responses toward socially acceptable answers
- Spotlight effect - we believe we're being noticed more than we really are
- Streisand effect - censoring information increases awareness of that information
- Pseudo-set framing - tasks that are part of a group are more tempting to complete
- Temptation bundling - hard tasks are less scary when paired with things we desire
- Unit bias - one unit of something feels like the ideal amount
- Variable reward - we profoundly enjoy unexpected rewards
- Weber's law - we adapt better to small incremental changes

Pseudo-conscious states of mind

- Affect heuristic - our current feelings cloud and influence our judgment
- Aha! moment - when users first realize a product's value
- Bandwagon Effect - we tend to believe something proportionally to how much others have believed it
- Cashless effect - we spend more when we don't actually see our money
- Chronoception - our perception of time is subjective
- Cognitive dissonance - we can hold opposing ideas in the mind at the same time
- Curse of knowledge - we're often unaware other people don't possess the same knowledge
- Dunning-Kruger effect - we tend to overestimate their skills when they don't know much
- False consensus effect - we tend to overestimate how much other people agree with them
- Feedforward - we know what to expect before acting
- Flow state - we can be fully [immersed into a task](success-4_routine.md)
- Internal trigger - we can be prompted to act based on a memory
- Law of locality - we connect things that are nearby other things
- Law of the instrument - the object we use dictates how we perceive everything else
- Miller's law - we typically can only keep 3-7 things in our memory at once
- Reciprocity - we feel the need to respond when we receive something
- Recognition over recall - we recognize things more easily than recalling them from memory

Mostly-conscious [decision-making](people-decisions.md)

- Availability heuristic - we favor recent and available information over past information
- Decision fatigue - making many decisions makes us more irrational toward more decisions
- Endowment effect - we value something more if we feel it's ours
- Fresh start effect - we're more likely to take action if we feel there's something new to it
- Investment loops - when we invest into something, we're more likely to use it later
- Jakob's law - when we interact with something, we treat it like other things we're familiar with

- Sensory appeal - we tend to use things more often that appeal to multiple senses
- Status quo bias - we tend to do what we've done before until we have reason to do otherwise
- Sunk cost effect - we're slow to pull out of something we've invested into
- Reactance - we're less likely to do something when we feel forced

Time management

- Chipmunk effect - we are more likely to select a video that plays faster than normal playback speed (around 1.2x)
- Commitment/consistency - we tend to be consistent with our previous actions
- Default bias - we don't tend to change established behaviors
- Doherty threshold - we're most productive when we're interacting with their objects with less than 0.4 seconds' delay between events
- Labor illusion - we value things more *after* we've done work on it
- Labor perception bias - we tend to imagine some things *always* take work
- Planning fallacy - we tend to underestimate how much time a task will take
- Spacing effect - we [learn more](understanding.md) when [study sessions](mind-memory.md) are spaced out

Memory

- Delighters - we more easily remember pleasure that's unexpected and playful
- Method of loci - we remember things more when it's associated with a location
