- it's essentially an interactive game involving taking photos!

open world games are the worst possible genre of game for any life balance
- they are effectively combinations of various games, typically with a repetitive gameplay loop that doesn't require much skill to [habituate], frequently interspersed with various other mini-games that would otherwise stand on their own
- it can effectively render someone capable of playing nonstop, often for weeks on end
- role-playing games were the predecessor to this as well
- if someone is doing something for more than a few hours consistently, and not honoring their body's signals, there had better be a good reason for it

A study of video games concluded that the principal draw for the players was not graphics and gore but the feelings of control and competence the players could attain as they mastered the game.

## game engines

The trouble with game engines is that they will likely deprecate
- when they're no longer supported, the games that they supported will also suffer
- the only solution is to have a well-established archive of the game AND the engine, or have it decompiled and reworked into modern OS
- for financial profit reasons, many games disappear entirely in their native form and often only exist as remastered editions by game developers

## Game Mechanics

FROM BEN CROSHAW:
- games don't have to be "fun" (relative word and doesn't capture the range of experiences), but it DOES have to be "engaging"
- the 3 Cs of gaming:
    - Context - a [symbolic] relationship to something else
    - Challenge - a provocation to find [meaning] through accomplishing a [purpose]
    - Catharsis - the profound joy of accomplishing or experiencing something in the present
    - At least 1 of the 3 at any moment in time is necessary for a great gaming experience
    - Most modern games are basically nothing but "all catharsis, all the time"

[Disco Elysium RPG System Analysis - Game Design Thinking](https://gamedesignthinking.com/disco-elysium-rpg-system-analysis/)
- make sure to indicate how a "gameplay loop" ends up working (i.e., reproduces [habits] through a "cycle")

Gamplay loop: a game must create a flowing loop that manifests a catharsis inside that loop
- boomer shooters are effectively feeling severe efficiency
- arcade games have people feeling improvement (via higher scores each time)

BE SURE TO ADDRESS STRATEGY GAMES

[Great Detective Games Let You Fail Miserably - Extra Punctuation](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/great-detective-games-let-you-fail-miserably-extra-punctuation/)
- games need to let the player fail, and fail spectacularly
- that failure magnifies the success if the player is willing to push through it
- it's the singular reason why people nostalgically remember Nintendo/Capcom titles from the late 80's.

## game selection

[Why don't younger kids play single player games? : gaming](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1be4exc/why_dont_younger_kids_play_single_player_games/)
- THEY BASICALLY DON'T HAVE MONEY AND SINGLE PLAYER GAMES ARE OFTEN FREE

## Game Testing

The quality of a game comes SEVERELY in how well it's tested
- the responsiveness of the character must ALWAYS be quick, even with many elements on the screen
    - This is why many high-quality game devs like to program in C or Rust
- if it's 3D, it must have good-quality camera controls/angles

## mechanics

the game mechanics convey a  sense of [meaning] to the player
- however, many games can be utterly mean-spirited (e.g., super meat boy vs N)
- a game should be challenging, but for the purpose of expanding the player's horizons, NOT for simply being mean to the player

## game crash of 1983
    - 1977 - Atari made the VCS console, the biggest seller of the era.

    - Game developers were not credited, all games show as made by Atari.

    - Warren Robinet is credited with the first video game Easter Egg after hiding his name on a hidden screen in the game “Adventure” which nobody at Atari spotted before release.

    - Developers of the time were making the whole product, game, boxart, manual etc.

    - David Crane led something of a mutiny and asked for developers to be credited and rewarded based on their own games’ success.

    - Ray Kassar told the mutineers that they were no more important to Atari than the guy on the production line who put the game in the box, they may as well be “….towel designers. Anybody can make a cartridge!”

    - David Crane calculated his games alone brought Atari around $20m compared to his $20,000 salary.

    - The four (David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead), left Atari and formed Activision in 1979 and made games for the Atari console.

    - Atari sued Activision saying that only Atari can make games for the Atari.

    - Activision won the case and third-party game developers were born and sprung up everywhere.

    - Now that anybody could make games, lots did and the quality of games generally slipped.

    - Notably, a highly anticipated version of Pac-Man was panned despite selling very well, over 8m copies, however Atari produced around 13m copies (more than the number of consoles sold).

    - To coincide with the launch of the movie E.T., Atari made a game based on the movie but had only six weeks to do it.

    - The game was terrible and was thought to be broken because E.T. would keep falling into pits in the forest.

    - Most E.T. games were returned and buyers’ confidence had waned. Other competitors were now doing better than Atari.

    - Atari took the returned and unsold E.T. cartridges, consoles and other items to a landfill in New Mexico and crushed and buried them.

    - This was a mythical tale for years until 2014 when they were dug up again as part of a documentary.

    - Some had survived the crushing and became collectors’ items (along with many eBay fakes sold in bags of soil).

    - The documentary is called Atari: Game Over and is worth a watch.

    - A band called Wintergreen also told the story of the burial in their music video “When I Wake Up” Great song! ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_AOPxZHPfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_AOPxZHPfE))

    - Around 1983 the whole industry crashed and did not reappear until October 1985 when Nintendo test launched the NES in America before a full launch in 1986.

    - Each NES game carried a badge called the “Nintendo Seal of Approval” as each game could only be published via Nintendo.

    - Third party developers were licensed and given credit on their games.

    - Interestingly, with me being in the UK, we never felt the crash as most of the UK used 8bit computers (C64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro) rather than consoles, and the computer scene was booming all through that period.

    - As a result, the NES did not do all that well in the UK but it definitely revived the US market.

    - Incidentally, the BBC Micro story is also an interesting one and is told very well in a movie called “Micro Men” that you can easily find.

    - Again, that story is told in a music video by a great band called “The British IBM” ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCyLLFNh24E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCyLLFNh24E))
