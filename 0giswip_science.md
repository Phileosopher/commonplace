NOTE: DOVETAILS WITH NAG SCIENCE

Science is a robust branch of metaphysics that specializes in the knowable, known, and potentially knowable. It starts with what people consider common sense, then develops as a [story](stories.md) to clarify whether that [sense](mind-feelings.md) is accurate.

The specific method for scientific understanding is an established procedure designed to remove individual [bias](mind-bias.md):

1. Ask a question.
   - Someone must be able to test and observe that question's answer.
   - This question comes from a [desire](purpose.md) to discover [facts](reality.md), but the rest of the steps are a [story](stories.md) that concludes with communicating the findings.
2. Do background research.
   - Investigate any existing discoveries from publications, past data, wikis, anecdotes, and personal experiences.
   - Good scientists work hard to suspend *all* [judgment](understanding-certainty.md) as they thoroughly sift through the information, though [they can never be entirely precise](mind-bias.md).
3. Build an educated guess (i.e., a "hypothesis").
   - It doesn't have to make sense, but must be [logical](logic.md).
4. Test that guess with an experiment.
   - All experiments require identifying [numbers](math.md) (quantitative) or [qualities](values.md) (qualitative).
   - Whenever possible, have a "control" and "test" group to compare differences.
   - Sometimes, the experiments are merely focused observations.
5. Analyze the data from the experiment, then conclude something.
   - Break the information into [tables, charts, and graphs](data-viz.md) to find [patterns](symbols.md), a bit like [the creative process](mind-creativity-how.md).
   - Keep many notes about how you got the data so anyone else can get the same results if they reproduce your conditions.
   - The conclusion should be so blatantly obvious that any other sane person with the same evidence will infer the same conclusion.
6. [Communicate](people-conversation.md) the results and get feedback.
   - The communication step is *loaded* with [politics](power.md) and [bias](image.md) from [human nature](humanity.md), though many in the scientific community [believe](trust.md) the system is self-correcting.
   - If the results diverge from [convention or tradition](habits.md), the feedback will likely create [controversy](people-conflicts.md).
   - Often, editing the [presentation](stories.md) of the scientific paper can advance the controversial result through [virtue signaling](stories-storytellers.md) the community's [pre-existing beliefs](trust.md).

## Science has limits

Science is a method, so it can give answers to questions, but never *provides* those questions. Those come from the [curiosity](purpose.md) of people wishing to know, [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) of what would happen if they *don't* know, or some form of personal gain through the [publishing process](stories-storytellers.md).

All scientific theories can only represent 2 possibilities:

1. Theories known to be wrong, since they were sufficiently tested and adequately rejected.
2. Theories that haven't been affirmed as wrong yet, not falsified yet, but are exposed to the possibility of being wrong.

It's impossible to use science to [deductively](logic.md) affirm something as right or true, simply because humanity cannot perceive all [reality](reality.md), and therefore can only [inductively deduce](logic.md) reality with a margin of error.

Metaphysics concerns itself with *everything* that exists, but scientific thinking can only localize itself strictly to [provable](understanding-certainty.md) things. Without [philosophy](philosophy.md) or [theology](religion.md), everything beyond the provable is murky conjecture:

- Where the universe came from
- How life exists
- [What happens after we die](religion.md)
- Most of the disciplines surrounding [psychology](humanity.md), [economics](economics.md), and [politics](groups-large.md)
- Whether a [soul](humanity.md) exists

Even within the realm of [known things](understanding-certainty.md), a conversation with a small child will reveal *many* obvious things outside the scope of science.

Further, to answer every presently obvious question would yield many more beyond them, and the full breadth of scientific knowledge will never, *ever* end until either our [desire to understand](understanding.md) ceases or we've mastered all aspects of the universe.

## Scientists fail at science

The only way a scientific mind can assert that something is, in fact, [reality](reality.md), is to set up all experiments while believing a high possibility of failure. A healthy philosophy of the scientific method will consider *all* possibilities where an experience is definitely correlation (i.e., A, then B) but may not be causation (i.e., A causes B).

Further, a scientist will disclose *absolutely every reason* why their experiment might be invalid. However, this type of [storytelling](stories.md) is rigorous and requires a certain level of [humility](morality.md), and that degree of transparency works against how [human nature](humanity.md) is naturally [influenced](influence.md).

Most significant scientific studies require money, so they're also typically performed with a secondary [purpose](purpose.md) by their financiers. A studies' validity, therefore, can be derived from [understanding](understanding.md) why scientists performed it. The [group](groups-large.md) who acquired the data determines how it could have been [distorted](mind-bias.md):

1. If the study was financed by a [corporation](mgmt-badsystems.md), its conclusion will invariably lean toward the corporation's interests, and antagonistic conclusions regarding a [purpose](purpose.md) will be defunded or [buried](stories-storytellers.md).
2. If the study was financed by a [government](politics-systems.md), it runs the risk of being [politically slanted](politics-conservativeliberal.md), and will often be performed without enough resources for thorough results.
3. If the study was independent, it will likely be *extremely* underfunded or highly [biased](mind-bias.md) toward an agenda, depending on who funded it and why.

Further, the information isn't always publicly available, which requires *tons* of rework by other scientists later, especially when [studies are falsified](image-distortion.md). Every significant discovery requires 95% more work than would have been necessary in a [perfect society](politics-perfectsociety.md).

The [bias](mind-bias.md) of scientific [peer-reviewed papers](stories-storytellers.md) shows through their selection process:

1.If the paper is controversial, but advances a [political opinion](politics-conservativeliberal.md) that's at least somewhat [fashionable](trends.md), it gets published and becomes popular.
2. If the paper legitimately [reinforces](symbols.md) the existing information, it gets published, but usually won't be [news](stories-storytellers.md) to anyone.
3. However, if it's [random information](math.md), [inconclusive](logic.md), or [vague](unknown.md), it rarely gets published or receives very little [attention](image.md).

Since scientists often have a [bias](mind-bias.md), the name of a scientific paper's [author](stories-storytellers.md) has a *dramatic* effect on the [popularity](influence.md) of the paper.

Scientific papers with significant findings are given a [positive reputation](image.md) through peer-review, but they are only reliable or valid when they're peer-replicable. This is boring and labor-intensive, but it's absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, replication is rarely [fashionable](trends.md).

In practice, the development of known scientific realities doesn't arise from an [entire community's](groups-large.md) relentless pursuit of truth, but arises with the same [trend-based](trends.md) [power](power.md) [struggle](power-types.md) and [influence](influence.md) that arises with any other [human](humanity.md) [endeavor](purpose.md).

## Scientism

Like any other [specialized group](jobs-spcialization.md), scientific communities have outlier members who represent extreme values. One [personality](personality.md) defect of most scientists (by virtue of their approach) is that they can't easily live with [uncertainty](understanding-certainty.md). A legitimate science "purist" is driven to accept complete uncertainty on many things (and likely will be a form of [agnostic](religion.md)), while someone who abides by [scientism](glossary-philosophy.md) believes in an almost [religious power](religion.md) within the scientific method.

Unfortunately, most of the scientific community has come to [trust](trust.md) one another beyond anything sensible for the discipline. The very essence of science-based thinking is to sow [dissent](people-conflicts.md) by *dis*trusting preconceived notions, with the scientific results proving empirically who is legitimately correct.

One reason for *why* science's philosophy contradicts its practice is because we are constantly preoccupied with the constraints of [death](legacy.md). That [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) (and natural time constraint) drives us to hastily affirm that we're only *mostly* certain, instead of investing the time to get it completely right.

Since their break from the [religious](religion.md) community, scientism uses several [philosophical values](values.md) to drive their opinions:

1. Common-sense experiences have zero legitimate authority.
2. Measuring things [mathematically](math.md) is more important than measuring [the quality of things](values-quality.md).
3. Nature itself is [mechanical](engineering.md), so holistic and unknowable elements have no relevance to the information.
4. We are wasting our time with "why" questions, and our best answers come from "how" questions.

The logical outcome of a few centuries of these dominating conclusions are several assertions that fundamentally can't be proven without [some degree of trust](trust.md) in the community's opinions:

1. Presuming enough [technology](technology.md), all things can be proven directly with the scientific method.
2. The universe came spontaneously from pre-existing materials, which have always existed.
3. Archaeological and geological records indicate the world is millions of years old.
4. Humanity came into existence through millions of years of beneficial mutations, with [less fit organisms](engineering.md) dying off.
5. Social progress only comes through secular developments, typically through advancements of the [State's power](mgmt-badsystems.md).

One heavy assertion by scientism is that science's [narratives](stories.md) are driven purely by [statistical](imagination.md) reality. But, *both* purists and scientism are quick to say that enough correlation equals causation:

- The more ice cream sales there are, the higher the murder rate goes up.
- M. Night Shyamalan movie box office sales correspond to newspaper sales.
- The murder rate moves proportionally to using Internet Explorer.
- The warmer someone eats their breakfast, the higher the chance they'll have Alzheimer's Disease.
- Mexican lemon imports are directly tied to highway deaths.
- Internet piracy scales with global temperature.
- More Nicolas Cage movies connects to more pool drownings.

Therefore, there are *other* factors at work to demarcate truths that disregard statistical correlation, and statistical correlation without causation often means the two elements have another element contained within them. For example, most of the above can be simply explained by population density.

Science itself can never answer many domains, and there are valid [philosophical assertions](philosophy.md) that oppose scientism:

1. Common-sense experiences prove correlation, and therefore have authority toward their [results](mind-creativity-results.md). This means causation can only serve to make the information more efficient to [solve a problem](purpose.md).
2. [Meaning](meaning.md) is derived through our interpretation of the [quality of things](values-quality.md), so measuring things [mathematically](math.md) must serve that end.
3. Nature itself is holistic, so mechanical observation of nature is most effective at [fixing things](https://adequate.life/fix/), but not in studying it.
4. All "how" questions are subordinate to "why" questions, meaning all science is subordinate to the philosophies that drive the purpose for science in the first place.

As a logical flow, the scientific community needs to hear alternative [narratives](stories.md) of the same [facts](reality.md) proven by science:

1. Not all things are necessarily provable, no matter how far humanity advances.
2. Humanity came into existence through another being's [creation](creations.md), irrespective of how much time it took.
3. Archaeological, geological, and anthropological records indicate the world has only had thousands of years before it encountered a worldwide flood.
4. The universe came spontaneously from a pre-existing being, which has always existed.
5. Social progress comes through adherence to virtue, mostly through appropriately implemented [religion](religion.md).

The irony of [what we know](understanding-certainty.md) in context to [the unknown](unknown.md) is that we acquire so many known elements that we assume there's no more need to accept the unknown within our body of known [understanding](understanding.md).

## Application

Great scientists are more concerned with investigating things against popular convention than disproving them. For that reason, most scientists are [unfashionable](trends.md) nerds.

Science is great at affirming and proving the patently obvious, but the science nerds often endorse [fashions](trends.md) that aren't [true](reality.md), often believing *those* things to also be patently obvious.

Science can find facts, but not connections between facts. We still must consider [whether we understand truths correctly](reality.md), which is *not* a scientific endeavor.

"According to scientific studies" is the modern-day iteration of "according to the Bible" in the Middle Ages or "according to the gods" in antiquity.

While science removes individual bias, it doesn't do anything for collective bias. If every human is the same kind of delusional, the scientific community is effectively a large group that shares similar delusions.

Scientific studies are only useful to the degree they're boring.

The scientific community has enough hubris that they aren't willing to accept things they can never know. For that reason, among others, most scientific papers are [image distortion](image-distortion.md) that sneak [self-interested](morality-evil.md), bad [ideas](values.md) past other scientists' [common sense](understanding.md).

To know whether a scientific study is even trustworthy, ask who is paying for the study and *that* [group's](groups-large.md) [bias](mind-bias.md) and [interests](purpose.md).

Scientists often preoccupy themselves with [understanding](understanding.md) "what" and frequently with "how", but they will sometimes fall into bad [cultural](culture.md) beliefs based on the [traditions](habits.md) of other scientists:

1. Why do we have 2 nostrils?
   - Two nostrils give redundancy to prevent mucus from plugging up airflow.
2. Where did 2 nostrils come from?
   - Evolution, since it was the fittest solution to a survival need.
3. Why don't we see *any* 1-nostril creatures?
   - They all died off.
4. Where is the fossil record for that?
   - We haven't found it yet, but will soon, and it's certainly not driven by an atheistic [agenda](groups-large.md).

Science is the tool, not the master. The [purpose](purpose.md) that drives science comes from other [sources](understanding.md). When scientists don't closely [look beyond](image.md) their [naturally occurring prejudice](mind-bias.md), they submit to the [trends](trends.md) of their [culture](culture.md) and time.

Scientific institutions devolve when they don't have a unified [purpose](purpose.md) for existing, and become the same as any other [bad system](mgmt-badsystems.md).
