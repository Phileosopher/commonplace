# Samuel (1st and 2nd) commentary

The book of Samuel is a historical narrative, so it is best seen as a series of [symbolic](symbols.md) patterns that represent theological truths.

- David represented all things of man: a great shepherd, great warrior, great king, great sinner
  - His sin with Bathsheba and killing Uriah effectively broke all ten commandments.
- David's son's death (Bathsheba's pregnancy) is a christological parallel
