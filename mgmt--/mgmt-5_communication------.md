SCRIPT THE CRITICAL MOVES.
Don't think big picture, think in terms of specific behaviors.
[1% milk, four rules at the Brazilian railroad]

POINT TO THE DESTINATION.
Change is easier when you know where you're going and why it's worth it.
["You'll be third graders soon," "No dry holes" at BP]

### MOTIVATE the Elephant

FIND THE FEELING.
Knowing something isn't enough to cause change. Make people feel something.
[Piling gloves on the table, the chemotherapy video game, Robyn Waters's
demos at Target]

SHRINK THE CHANGE.
Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant.
[The 5-Minute Room Rescue, procurement reform]

GROW YOUR PEOPLE.
Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset.
[Brasilata's "inventors," junior-high math kids' turnaround]

### SHAPE the Path

TWEAK THE ENVIRONMENT.
When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation.
[Throwing out the phone system at Rackspace, 1-Click ordering,
simplifying the online time sheet]

BUILD HABITS.

using checklists]

RALLY THE HERD.
Behavior is contagious. Help it spread.

## communicating goals - sivers - The Art of Project Management - Scott Berkun

### WRITING THE VISION
The challenge of project management is not only to get things started up in the right direction, but also to keep it headed that way.
Writing things down makes it possible to define engineering work or capture the overall objectives for entire teams only once, then reuse that knowledge many times.

SIMPLYFYING : The vision should have a simplifying effect on the project. A good vision will provide answers to the core questions individuals have, and will give them a tool for making decisions in their own work.

GOAL-DRIVEN : A well-written goal defines a clear intention. Enough information is provided in the goal itself, that people will know when it's been completed. The fewer high-level goals, the more powerful the vision document becomes.
Try playing devil's advocate : ask how a project can still fail if its goal is satisfied as written. Consider if there is a way to more carefully phrase the goal.

INSPIRATIONAL : Give the reader a clear understanding of the opportunities that exist. Provide a solid plan for exploiting it. Make everyone understand the real-world problem to be solved, not just the technical one.

MEMORABLE : The ideas need to make sense and be interesting. Resonate with the reader. If the vision is too complex, it's impossible to achieve this effect. Be direct and honest. Clear and confident. Give the team strong concepts and ways of thinking about the work.

KEY POINTS TO COVER:
* What is the one sentence that defines this specific release of this specific project?
* How does this project contribute to the goals of the organization?
* Why is this project more relevant than anothers that also might contribute to the goals of the organization?
* What customer features are essential to this project? (Priority #1)
* What customer features are desired but not essential? (Priority #2)
* What solutions for customers have been requested but will definitely not be a part of this project?
* Who are the customers?
* What problems does this solve for them?
* How will customers get their job done without this project?
* Why will these customers buy this service?
* Who are the competitors?
* How will this project compare to theirs?
* How is this NOT a technology in search of a problem?
* What is the project NOT going to accomplish? (List things people might assume would be part of the project, but won't be.)
* What are some likely ways for this project to fail, and how will they be avoided or minimized?
* Who else is this project depending on in order to succeeed?
* Who else is depending on this project in order to succeeed?
* What assumptions are being made that the project depends on?

VISUAL:
We forget the power of images in expressing ideas.
The best vision documents include visual images.
Filmmakers use storyboards for the same purpose.
Showing a sketch of the final thing allows ever individual to put his own work in a larger context.
If this end result cannot be visualized, the vision is not clear.

DAILY WORSHIP:
Keep the vision visible : the few core goals should be up on posters in highly visible places.
Ask the following questions at every meeting:
1. Does the vision accurately reflect our goals and intentions for this project?
2. Is the vision helping people make decisions and reject requests that are out of scope?
3. Are there changes to the vision docs that would make #1 and #2 true?

The vision should not be modified frequently. Major changes should be rare after the project is moving at full speed.
