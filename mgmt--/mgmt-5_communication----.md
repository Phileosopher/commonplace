## giving feedback

Distinguish between someone truly wanting and needing help, and someone
who is merely exploiting a willing helper.

All you have to do is… nothing. When someone offers a
less-than-brilliant idea in a meeting, don't criticize it. Say nothing.
When someone challenges one of your decisions, don't argue with them or
make excuses. Quietly consider it and say nothing. When someone makes a
helpful suggestion, don't remind them that you already knew that. Thank
them and say nothing. This is not a semantic game. The beauty of knowing
what to stop - of achieving this state of inspired neutrality - is that
it is so easy to do.

Hone a quick wit. Look for connections or analogies between unrelated
things.
- [creative] thinking can take you VERY far

If you want a team to NOT consult you for everything:
1. tell them you want them to take responsibility and not check with you
2. explain why : that you find it inefficient and a poor use of your time
3. reassure them that even though what you're asking would feel
    uncomfortable in their culture, it's OK in yours
4. repeat the advice a number of times
5. give them time to practice
6. immediate positive feedback

To get beyond the "doing only what's told":
1. encourage them to apply the instructions to an entire category of
    things, not only what's said
2. encourage them to be more direct in questioning innaccurate or wrong
    instructions
3. encourage them to be more direct in suggesting a better way of doing
    something

Addressing questions or remarks directly to subordinates is likely to be
seen by Indians as an attempt to circumvent the chain of command.
Everything must go through the manager/supervisor.

Praise the team, not the individual. They regard themselves as family,
collaborating, not competing. Praising one subordinate in front of the
others is an insult to the rest of the group, and an embarrassment for
the person singled out.

Planes are safer when the least experienced pilot is flying, because it
means the second pilot isn't going to be afraid to speak up. Combating
mitigation.
- rigidly enforced egalitarianism is the ONLY way to combat this

I don't think there has ever been a letter from my office which criticises the staff or an individual. Now and again I've disagreed with something and suggested changes in behaviour. But the Virgin Group has always tried to look for the best in people. That way, you get the best back.

You'd be amazed how quickly people change for the better, given the right circumstances, and how willing they are to learn from costly mistakes when offered a second chance. If you've over-promoted someone and it hasn't worked out, then offer them their old job back rather than firing them. It's your fault for over-promoting them. Not theirs.

Decent leadership is about explaining clearly and unemotionally why a decision has been taken.

The Dalai Lama said, "If you wish to experience peace - provide peace for another. If you wish to know that you are safe, cause others to know that they are safe. If you wish to understand seemingly incomprehensible things, help another better understand."

The most skilled and experienced members of the community provide leadership and help integrate contributions from the community.

Peering helps assign the right person to the right task more effectively than traditional firms. The reason is self-selection: when people voluntarily self-select for creative, knowledge-intensive tasks, they are more likely than managers to choose tasks for which they are uniquely qualified.

As long as communities have mechanisms for weeding out weak contributions, then large self-selecting communities of people in constant communication have a higher probability of matching the best people to the right tasks.

Collaborative outsourcing works best in areas that are not core to your product or central to your business model. Weaknesses. Areas where your market efforts have floundered.

men vs women in workplace
- men crave autonomy, and a healthy work environment involves many autonomous individuals who delegate responsibility by their volitional choice from finding meaning in sharing the work
- women generally want more affection, validation, and feedback, meaning there's plenty more dialogue
- this is not a hard-and-fast rule, but conventional [gender] roles are guaranteed to play out among larger groups

## inspiring workers

Use momentum to keep major projects on course:
- Make momentum part of the plan. Don't move ahead until everyone knows how to create momentum.
- Grab low-hanging fruit. Select a few major "wins" and tackle them before doing anything else.
- Go for just one big win. One important thing, and really deliver on it.
- Celebrate early successes publicly. Celebrate. Congratulate everyone. Give updates and praise people involved.

Attaching yourself to existing movements that have momentum will create the best results.

## meetings

Meetings : Verbatim minutes are taken. I read all of the minutes of these meetings very carefully and I can get a mite cross if they are not produced promptly and accurately. For me they are not a memorandum of past events. They are a tool to understanding current positions. I also have my personal financial manager as well as my group CFO placed on all these boards. If I'm not present you can be sure he is.

NOTE: INDICATE ROBERT'S RULES

Don't schedule important meetings at 3 p.m. It just doesn't make sense because you need naps!

Try to avoid all unnecessary meetings

Most meetings can be summarized by an email

- Be clear about the specified end time, which should never be more than 30 minutes unless it's critical

The human brain evolved under conditions of almost constant motion. From
this, one might predict that the optimal environment for processing
information would include motion. That is exactly what one finds.
Indeed, the best business meeting would have everyone walking at about
1.8 miles per hour.

Managers as input/output machines
When I first started working with my PhD advisor, I thought our weekly meeting was for me to prove to him that I had been productive.
That is false.
Now that I have grad students, I see this same behavior. But it isn't a good use of anyone's time.
These meetings are for getting feedback.
In the words of my PhD advisor: "advisors are input/output machines". You put into it your update and you get back feedback. The meeting is for your benefit.
However, you have to show up with something in order to get feedback. If all you say is "I'm still looking into that one thing" or "I'm stuck", then there is little to go off of. Sometimes that happens though. But if you want help from your advisor/manager, you have to show up with something. This is virtually always possible to do, even if you think you didn't make progress, though it does take a bit effort to get organized.

A few suggestions for running update meetings with your advisor/manager:
Assume they forgot everything that was said last meeting.
Show up with things to talk about and a goal.
In 3-4 sentences, refresh everyone's memory about the last meeting and what you were supposed to accomplish since then.
In 4-6 sentences, summarize what you did, what worked, what didn't work, and what you think you should do next. Think of this as bullet points.
Avoid diving into details until you know everyone is on the same page and caught up.
If possible, show up with something tangible, like a visual aid, a demo, a draft, or at least some notes.

My advice, based on thousands of such meetings over the years, is to keep them short. Unless your gut tells you you've stumbled across a winner, set the meeting at 20 minutes. Have someone interrupt you after 25 minutes and have the caller ushered swiftly from your room.

MEETINGS : Indians meet not so much to discuss and deliberate, but to
present the results of their discussions and deliberations.

On Meetings:
- Meetings start off innocuously, with a few people, maybe once a month
- Then it gets larger, and the meetings get more frequent
- Then it gets longer, to keep everyone updated
- eventually, it's every 2-3 workdays, 90 minutes each, making the effective workweek 37 hours without overtime
- the manager must be mindful of when people:
    - start getting bored, since the [speaker] isn't making it interesting, and the workday will suffer from their unhappiness
    - don't need to be there because it's irrelevant to them (for pending decisions), and can be put in an email for them to skim if they need
- further, the topics that DO need addressing need to be chopped up:
    - 1 topic per decision-making meeting
    - meet as-needed, and expect it to take 3-4 times longer than you'd think (either from limited [understanding], unforeseen [conflicts], or [as-of-yet unknown] information)

Gates estimates that he devotes 70 percent of his time to review
meetings with small product development teams.

Get as many people as possible into one room. And then go somewhere else.

## requests

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, ASK FOR IT
Don't beat around the bush. Don't assume people will know what you need.
Don't make them guess.
The more specific you are about what you need, the faster you'll get it.
If asking an employee or peer, clearly frame your request and set a
deadline.

## specificity

RESTAURANT: A checklist for every customer. When an order was placed up
front, it was printed out on a slip back in the kitchen. The ticket
specified the dishes ordered, the table number, the seat number, any
preferences required by the customer or noted in a database from
previous visits - food allergies, for instance, or how the steak should
be cooked, or whether this was a special occasion like a birthday or a
visit from a VIP.

You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed
to be used

You must decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO
checklist.

DO-CONFIRM checklist:
… team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often
separately. But then they stop.
They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was
supposed to be done was done.

READ-DO checklist:
people carry out the tasks as they check them off - it's more like a recipe.

We adopted mainly a DO-CONFIRM rather than a READ-DO format, to give
people greater flexibility in performing their tasks while nonetheless
having them stop at key points to confirm that critical steps have not
been overlooked.

Must nurses make written check marks? No, we decided, they didn't have
to. This wasn't a record-keeping procedure. We were aiming for a team
conversation to ensure that everyone had reviewed what was needed

We had a team in London try the draft checklist and give us suggestions,
then a team in Hong Kong. With each successive round, the checklist got
better.

Even the most expert among us can gain from searching out the patterns
of mistakes and failures and putting a few checks in place.

The handbook was comprised not of one checklist but of scores of them.
Each one was remarkably brief, usually just a few lines on a page in
big, easy-to-read type. And each applied to a different situation. Taken
together, they covered a vast range of flight scenarios. First came what
pilots call their "normal" checklists - the routine lists they use for
everyday aircraft operations. There were the checks they do before
starting the engines, before pulling away from the gate, before taxiing
to the runway, and so on. In all, these took up just three pages. The
rest of the handbook consisted of the "non-normal" checklists covering
every conceivable emergency situation a pilot might run into: smoke in
the cockpit, different warning lights turning on, a dead radio, a
copilot becoming disabled, and engine failure, to name just a few. They
addressed situations most pilots never encounter in their entire
careers. But the checklists were there should they need them.

These things mean NO to a high-context person:
- responding with a question
- won't answer your question
- hesitate
- qualified yes ("maybe" or "should be possible")
- postponing ("let me ask my team")
- saying how busy they are
- agreeing at first, but then asking about it again later

These are ASKING FOR HELP to a high-context person:
- saying how busy they are
- saying something is taking longer than expected
- implying a deadline might be missed (you are supposed to ask why)
- something is more complicated than they thought
- talking about another team that recently needed and received help
- talking about a time when they received help in the past

These are NEGATIVE CRITICISM ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL to a high-context person:
- avoiding any response
- repeating your suggestion
- a loud silence
- suggesting an alternative
- asking your opinion of your own idea
- only praising part of it

If you want Indians to be more direct, you have to tell them several
times, and give them time to get used to being what they regard as
impolite. Give strong feedback as soon as you see the least sign of
Indians doing what you've asked.

Don't telegraph the answer you want. They will say what they think you
want to hear. Don't say, "That won't take long, will it?" or "Can you
get it done by Friday?"

If you really want to know what they think, don't begin by telling them
what you think.

In India, bosses do not empower subbordinates. They are expected to check-in
constantly to get the boss's OK. Subbordinates should never act empowered.
When talking to a team, you must talk to the boss, not the subbordinates.

The more guidance, the better. Explicit, detailed, specific instructions.

Have formal written business processes for every signifiant job function. Outsource it to a consultant who specializes in creating and maintaining written business processes.

If you are trying to persuade someone to join you, invest with you, or make some changes, then it's important to speak to them directly and take the time so that they know what they must do.

Remember to communicate, and pay attention to detail. You wouldn't believe how far you can get, just by remembering and practising those two rules.
