Strategies and Skills Learning and Development
SSLD uses N3C:
    needs
    circumstances
    characteristics
    capacity
it defines problems and challenges in life in terms of human needs

before anything else, we have to ask: why do people even have relationships in the first place?
- we have relationships based on needs, which come in 4 different levels
    Physical
        Food
        Water
        Shelter
        Safety
        All things we experienced as infants
    Psychological/Interpersonal
        Security
        Attachment
        Affiliation
        Intimacy
    Social
        Sense of Identity
        Social Position
        Status
        Access to resources and opportunities in our social world
    Existential/Spiritual
        Purpose
        Sense of Being
        Union with the universe
we ask "what are my needs?", but not everyone understands their needs very clearly
we often have wants that are confused as needs
Needs can be intrinsic or extrinsic
    Intrinsic - we value the relationship for its own sake
        Affiliation
        Attachment
        Intimacy
    Extrinsic - we have a secondary purpose for the relationship
        Personal
        Instrumental
feedback from relationships heavily impact who we are

SSLD uses strategies and skills
    strategies are sequences of actions aimed at achieving a particular goal
    skills are something you can do well to achieve a particular task
    it is basically a "post-professional era" tool, meant to draw from more than one specialization to achieve goals
it breaks into a method
    1. identifies the problem translation
        problems come from unmet needs, which can be met with better goals
    2. taking action through SSLD
        adds SSLD to help with the goals
    3. beyond problem solving

## alliance of stupidity

make sure the dumb decisions don't reproduce
- it's easy enough for employees to stay on track by themselves, but multiple dumb decisions compound when people are in groups
- if someone has a tendency to do dumb things, keep that person around someone qualified and authoritative on the subject
 
## fixing and optimizing

Suppose that you go to bed tonight and sleep well. Sometime, in the
middle of the night, while you are sleeping, a miracle happens and all
the troubles that brought you here are resolved. When you wake up in the
morning, what's the first small sign you'd see that would make you
think, 'Well, something must have happened - the problem is gone!'?" The
Miracle Question doesn't ask you to describe the miracle itself; it asks
you to identify the tangible signs that the miracle happened.

A second question, which is perhaps even more important. The Exception
Question: "When was the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle,
even just for a short time?"
Demonstrate, in a subtle way, is that the client is capable of solving
her own problem. As a matter of fact, the client is offering up proof
that she's already solved it.
Let's replay that scene, where things were working for you. What was
happening? How did you behave?
You are simply asking yourself, "What's working and how can we do more
of it?"

Big problem, small solution. This is a theme you will see again and
again. Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions.
Instead, they are most often solved by a sequence of small solutions,
sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades.

"What's working, and how can we do more of it?" Sounds simple, doesn't
it? Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked.
Instead, the question we ask is more problem focused: "What's broken,
and how do we fix it?"

## key supervisory challenges

1.	Communicating effectively with team members, including setting clear expectations and resolving conflicts.
2.	Prioritizing and managing tasks while supporting the team.
3.	Evaluating employee performance and addressing underperformance.
4.	Delegating tasks effectively and handling trust or control issues.
5.	Navigating organizational changes and ensuring effective leadership.
6.	Managing diverse personalities and fostering teamwork.
7.	Making tough decisions while balancing team and organizational needs.
8.	Supporting professional growth through coaching and mentorship.
9.	Managing workload and preventing stress and burnout.
10.	Ensuring high levels of employee engagement and motivation.

## making decisions

Fixing on a decision prematurely reduces your options, perhaps to the
point of eliminating the successful choice.

You'll learn a little bit more every day. You'll learn more about the
users, the project itself, your team, and the technology. That means
you'll be at your peak of intelligence at the very end of the project
and at your most ignorant at the very beginning. So, do you want to make
decisions early on? No; you want to defer closure for as long as
possible in order to make a better decision later. But that means
critical issues may stay unsettled for a long time, which makes many
people acutely uncomfortable. Resist the pressure. Know that you will
reach a decision, and the matter will be settled, just not today.

Agile software development embraces the idea of working with
uncertainty. Early on, you don't know what the project end date will
really be. You're not 100 percent certain which features will be present
in the next iteration. You don't know how many iterations there will be.
And that's perfectly OK: that's the sort of uncertainty you want to be
comfortable with.

Lead. Do not be led. You have employed smart people. Great. But you are their leader. If you sniff an opportunity, get them to consider it. If they still don't get excited, take the project into your private office and begin it there. Do not leave the opportunity within the company to be sabotaged, focus-grouped and committeed to death.

To be safe and sustainable, you want to see 6 mos advance operating expenses saved up

## managementmethodologies_waterfall

The best SDLC available was [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) with all of its problems that were not lost on us even then. The whole industry did very long release projects, such as two months of requirements gathering and design specification followed by nine months of coding and then three months of testing. Even if we did see then (and we mostly didn't) that small, frequent releases were better in a whole bunch of ways, we couldn't really do it. It was expensive to ship on physical media, and disruptive to our customers to have to do frequent installs.
