Whenever a control/check/restriction is put in place
A. consider its COSTS along with its benefits
B. imagine all the people who would be most adversely affected by the change

BEAT CHANGE TO THE PUNCH:
Carl Jung: "If there's a fear of falling, the only safety is deliberately jumping."
Scan trade publications and talk with peers to discover new technologies, business practices, or processes that might help you do your job better.

This is a book about the right question:
NOT : "How do we use the cool new tools to support our existing structure?",
but "How do we become an organization that thrives because of the new marketing?"
NOT : "How do we use this new marketing to maintain business as usual?",
but "How can our business itself be altered?"

Ask not what the new marketing can do for you.
Ask what you can do to thrive with the new marketing.

MEATBALL : a commodity, a branded item of little differentiation and decent quality.
You can't grow with meatballs because they're ubiquitious.
Stop making meatballs, and start making something that goes very well with hot fudge and marshmallow sauce.

Nimble, intelligent organizations that are poised and prepared, ready to be propelled by the fresh tactics of the new marketing.

Old toy fairs : the manufacturers would show the sellers the commercials 9 months in advance. The commercials that got the best reception led to toys getting made. The rest were cancelled.

We make what people buy. If it doesn't sell, it doesn't get made.

Business growth comes from satisfying the people who can best leverage your ideas.

New marketing doesn't demand better marketing. It demands better products, better services, and better organizations.

Marketing doesn't support the organization. The organization supports marketing.

Making noise is fun, but making noise is not where the highest returns lie.

Critical-Mass Checklist:
1. Do more users benefit the other users by bringing down prices or increasing the power of communication?
2. Are we falsely relying on the masses to solve problems that are obvious when we have small numbers of customers?
3. How can we lower the number of users we'll need before the benefits of critical mass kick in?
4. Does style matter? Are we betting people will become our customers because "everyone else is doing it"? If so, how do we realistically cross that chasm?

During times of change, the very last people you need on your team are well-paid bureaucrats, note takers, literalists.

The compliant masses don't help so much when you don't know what to do next.

What we must have are indispensable human beings. We need original thinkers, provocateurs, and people who care.

If you make your business possible to replicate, you're not going to be the one to replicate it. Others will. If you build a business filled with rules and procedures that are designed to allow you to hire cheap people, you will have to produce a product without humanity or personalization or connection. Which means that you'll have to lower your prices to compete. Which leads to a race to the bottom. Indispensable businesses race to the top instead.

Win by being more ordinary, more standard, and cheaper. Or win by being faster, more remarkable, and more human.

It's factory work because it's planned, controlled, and measured. It's factory work because you can optimize for productivity. These workers know what they're going to do all day-and it's still morning.

If we can put it in a manual, we can outsource it. If we can outsource it, we can get it cheaper.

The only way to get what you're worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about.

Paradigms are mental models that constrain our thinking and are often based on assumptions so strong we don't notice them. New paradigms cause disruption and uncertainty, even calamity, and are nearly always received with coolness, hostility, or worse. Vested interests fight against the change, and leaders of the old are often the last to embrace the new. Consequently, a paradigm shift typically causes a crisis of leadership.

Fine-tune your radar and move quickly to seize the opportunities for influence as a new business paradigm takes hold.

Profound changes favor the newcomer.

Throw away some of your detailed plans.

Leaders manage chaos the way a kindergarten teacher manages her students.

Planning must allow for a high degree of learning on your part. The great examples have adopted their strategies as they learned what worked and what did not work for the overall community.
- Taking cues from your lead users
- Building critical mass
- Supplying an infrastructure for collaboration
- Take your time to get the structures and governance right
- Make sure all participants can harvest some value. (Some do it for fun, philosophical reasons, for profit, fulfill unmet needs, reputation, career prospects.)
- Abide by community norms
- Let the process evolve
- Hone your collaborative mind

## making decisions

What's the most critical factor in any business decision you'll ever have to make? Basically, it boils down to this question: If this all crashes, will it bring the whole house tumbling down like a pack of cards?

When we're faced with a problem, we get together promptly to look for the answer to a single question: 'Is there a way out?' And we then go right to the endgame and ask: 'What is the ideal way out of this problem for everyone?' You need to become 100 per cent focused on trying to find that way out. If it's a major problem, give it 100 per cent of your time and energy until it is sorted. Work night and day to resolve it, and try to delegate everything else that is going on. If, having done this, you fail to resolve the problem, then at least you know you've done everything in your power you can. Move on.

Some academics suggest that CEOs have, at best, a minor impact on corporate performance.

The more power you give a single individual in the face of complexity and uncertainty, the more likely it is that bad decisions will get made.

Use methods of aggregating collective wisdom.

The more important the decision, the more important it is that it not be left in the hands of a single person.

A bad business usually prevails over a good management.

Google's ambitions are startling, and the hurdle for potential acquisition targets is high: they must pass a "toothbrush test", meaning that their services must be potentially useful to most people once or twice every day.

## mergers and acquisitions

Always ensure that you want to fight and ought to fight on a larger competitor's ground. If he is anxious to buy you, determined to park his tanks on your ground, maybe you should let him - for the right price.

If your competitor is smaller, try to hire him or buy him or join with him. If he won't budge, take drastic action and smash him. If that won't work, then learn to be friends and collude against the wolly mammoths together.

when an executive leaves, they "step down" to lose face
- however, everyone in the industry knows it's a proper quitting due to incompetence
- the only time this DOESN'T happen is when they want to make an example of that person

## messaging - old tPA

### Organizations only succeed with a well-communicated vision

The message must bring a passion for serving a higher purpose beyond self-interest
- Procedures and tasks change with culture and situation, but a vision won't move
- The purpose must form into something to specifically help someone
- The more straightforward and focused the message is, the farther and quicker it will travel
- The vision will carry itself far beyond the individual and into future generations when expressed correctly

Members of the organization should have more than enough training to succeed at working toward the vision
Everyone in the organization must be devoted wholly to the organization's vision
- The organization's principles should require members to adapt or leave
- Members must feel their input contributes to the collective vision

Ask all of the members what they think, not just the highest-ranking
Keep budget items for new communication channels
- Choose your communication channels carefully
- Use visuals to communicate more clearly
- Promote the organization more effectively with a young social media advisory board

Roll out products and services as an overall experience
- Advertise the ceremonious occasion with a fanfare
- Publicly put old and discontinued products to rest like a eulogy of a great idea that ran its course
- Invalidate and learn from dysfunctional products and services publicly to ensure the situation doesn't repeat itself

## optimizing flow

The one envelope at a time approach is called "single-piece flow" in lean manufacturing. It works because of the surprising power of small batches. When we do work that proceeds in stages, the "batch size" refers to how much work moves from one stage to the next at a time.

In process-oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance of the system.

Instead of working in separate departments, engineers and designers would work together side by side on one feature at a time. Whenever that feature was ready to be tested with customers, they immediately would release a new version of the product, which would go live on our website for a relatively small number of people. The team would be able immediately to assess the impact of their work, evaluate its effect on customers, and decide what to do next. For tiny changes, the whole process might be repeated several times per day.

In School of One, students have daily "playlists" of their learning tasks that are attuned to each student's learning needs, based on that student's readiness and learning style.

There are assessments built into each activity so that data can be fed back to the teacher to choose appropriate tasks for the next playlist.

The longer we worked, the more afraid we became of how customers would react when they finally saw the new version. As our plans became more ambitious, so too did the number of bugs, conflicts, and problems we had to deal with. Pretty soon we got into a situation in which we could not ship anything. Our launch date seemed to recede into the distance. The more work we got done, the more work we had to do. The lack of ability to ship eventually precipitated a crisis and a change of management, all because of the trap of large batches.

Lean production solves the problem of stockouts with a technique called pull. When you bring a car into the dealership for repair, one blue 2011 Camry bumper gets used. This creates a "hole" in the dealer's inventory, which automatically causes a signal to be sent to a local restocking facility called the Toyota Parts Distribution Center (PDC). The PDC sends the dealer a new bumper, which creates another hole in inventory. This sends a similar signal to a regional warehouse called the Toyota Parts Redistribution Center (PRC), where all parts suppliers ship their products. That warehouse signals the factory where the bumpers are made to produce one more bumper, which is manufactured and shipped to the PRC. The ideal goal is to achieve small batches all the way down to single-piece flow along the entire supply chain. Each step in the line pulls the parts it needs from the previous step. This is the famous Toyota just-in-time production method.8

The amount of just-in-case inventory [called work-in-progress (WIP) inventory] is reduced dramatically.
- THIS WAS ALSO A TERRIBLE THING DURING COVID, WHEN THERE WAS NO BACKUP FOR ANYTHING

One of the most important discoveries of the lean manufacturing movement: you cannot trade quality for time. If you are causing (or missing) quality problems now, the resulting defects will slow you down later. Defects cause a lot of rework, low morale, and customer complaints, all of which slow progress and eat away at valuable resources.

## organizational unrest - unions

unions are inevitable if the workers are feeling mistreated
- the situation has effectively become so bad that everyone would rather pile their work together and get measured on an arbitrary "hours/days of service" metric than be measured on their individual achievements
- they distrust their employer so badly that they are more open to trusting a union rep than the person who cuts their check
- it's the combination of having a significant portion of lousy workers, mixed with bad management, mixed with bad pay structures
- if an organization even has talks of unionizing, it's time for the management to do some severe soul-searching

## proposing changes

Bright spots solve the "Not Invented Here" problem. Some people have a
knee-jerk skeptical response to "imported" solutions. Imagine the public
outcry if an American politician proposed that the United States adopt
the French health care system. (Or vice versa.) We all think our group
is the smartest. By looking for bright spots within the very village he
was trying to change, Sternin ensured that the solution would be a
native one.
They weren't experts. They didn't walk in with the answers. All they had
was a deep faith in the power of bright spots.

## reinvention

Reinventing the business design by using customer-centric and profit-centric principles has great rewards. Customers return. Profits grow. Employee morale rebounds.

Reinvention is about the customer and profitability, but ultimately it is about creativity, about designing a business model that is unique. Perhaps the most important benefit of studying any reinventors and how they discover or create the profit zone in their industries is grasping how the creative process works in business (how business designs change every 5 years), what discipline (in customer and profit thinking) it requires, and how extraordinary its outcomes can be.

Business design innovation drives financial improvement, which drives increased valuation, which drives value growth.

Business design innovation requires major nonincremental moves. Making such moves inevitably leads to major errors.

Management is trying to perfect yesterday's business design.
The opportunity has passed them by, yet they believe that if they can only get a little bigger or do a little better, they can still win.
They are fighting yesterday's war.
The battle meanwhile has moved on to an opportunity space redefined by new customer priorities.

Be on the lookout for what the next metrics revolution will be.

Understanding the fundamentals of business design innovation is perhaps the best preparation for an uncertain future.

## staying profitable

A lack of frugality was accepted as the norm in her company. "We're not very careful about our dollars," she said. "We stay in the best hotels, the annual sales meeting is in a fancy Florida resort, we eat well, we don't buy our airline tickets far enough in advance to save on the fare. We've come to think that this is how it's meant to be." She described the very human, organizational consequences of several years of corporate life in the land of illusion, the land of the "perpetual profit zone." Once formed, these organizational habits are extremely hard to break. As the profit zone moves, they can prove fatal.

Wal-Mart employees double up in budget hotels when they travel.

Profitability is a game of inches.

Transition to efficient company was effective.
It drove return on sales up from a negative 4 percent to a positive 6 percent and kept it there.
The same psychology could have been created 5 years earlier, but, until the crunch came, it wasn't pursued.
