# How to craft a résumé

The résumé is still popular because it proves the most critical business writing skill: intentional conciseness.

A résumé is a living document, and should adapt and change across your life's career.

Make a vast list of skills to pull from:

1. Write out a gigantic list of *every* skill you have, even irrelevant ones.
2. Specify which of those skills you love doing and are good at.
3. Consider environments that foster those skills the most.
4. Note any concrete skills for the job titles you want from [your brainstorming](jobs-2_goals.md).
5. Find [creative](mind-creativity.md) ways to make your seemingly unrelated skills from #2 enhance your résumé.

## Your résumé is a creative work, not a list

A résumé frames your professional career like a photograph:

- Ask other people what they see when they read it.
- A résumé should showcase your education, accomplishments, skills, and goals in the order of your choice.
- That résumé is telling an unfinished story the hiring manager should want to finish by interviewing you.

Recruiters look at résumés all day long, so they're trying to throw out as many as possible:

- Templates should be an inspiration, not the standard, especially since hiring managers have all seen them.
- What and how you choose to express things reflects *heavily* on who you are.
- Find ways to tastefully distinguish yourself and express your [personality](personality.md) throughout the résumé.
  - If your industry is open to it, make your résumé fun or unconventional.
- Logically break apart the résumé chronologically, functionally, or any other way the reader can understand.

Keep your résumé at about 600--700 words:

- Too many details will turn off a potential employer.
- Keep it long enough to avoid lots of white space.
- It's too long if your focus is confusing or unclear.
- Every single word matters, so consult a thesaurus.

## Every résumé is a custom-tailored marketing tool

The *entire* purpose of a résumé is to motivate 1 employer to ask for an interview:

- Precisely clarify what you can do for that employer.
  - You must explicitly imply you know the job you're trying to get.
- You may want to share your full career story, but you must wait for the interview.
- Since it's brief, a résumé usually draws more attention to what you *don't* say!
- Only add relevant information the hiring manager will want to read, then remove everything else.
- Hiring managers in some industries may find a conversationally styled résumé intriguing, but it's risky.

Modesty doesn't pay in a résumé:

1. You're competing against everyone else who wants the job.
2. Nobody can see your personality or character in-person.
3. Most employers *expect* candidates to lie on their résumé!
   - Spin the truth as positively as possible by omitting explicit details and getting as [creative](mind-creativity.md) as you can with the facts.

Employers aren't concerned with how interesting someone is, and just want a few questions answered to find someone who can do a job:

- How well have you done your current and past jobs?
- What resulted from you doing your job?
- How did you benefit your past employer(s) when you worked there?
- Why should I hire you over anyone else?

## Recruiters reject most résumés within 20 seconds from a few criteria

A. New graduate:

- No school accomplishments
- Little to no time in volunteer activities or unrelated work experience

B. Last job role:

- Whether they're currently employed and why they want a new role
- Whether their most recent experience can meet the employer's needs

C. Company recognition:

- The reputation of that company's corporate culture
- Assumptions about the candidate based on the company

D. Overall experience:

- Trends of improvement or stagnation
- The look and feel of the person's career trajectory

E. Keyword search:

- Looks for *exact* words directly tied to the job with the software's word-finding feature

F. Time gaps:

- Must be sufficiently explained somewhere
- Without an explanation, employers assume the worst

G. Personal online footprint:

- If the résumé has a web link, they *will* visit it
- Depending on the industry and how you do it, your [political values](politics-conservativeliberal.md) can sabotage callbacks from hiring managers

H. General logistics:

- Location, eligibility to work in the country
- Mostly to figure out their story instead of "weeding them out"

I. Overall organization:

- Spelling, grammar, and ease of reading
- Length shouldn't be less than a page or exceed two pages

## Recruiters and managers often overlook other details

Education:

- Each industry and company has wildly different expectations for education.
- Employers will sometimes note the degree (e.g., BS, MBA) but are more interested in skill than formalized education.

Fancy formatting:

- While a well-formatted résumé might be fun to read, it can't compensate for someone having no apparent experience.

Specific personal details:

- Unless it's for an acting role, employers aren't concerned with weight or height.
- A company only cares about diversity quotas (e.g., family status, citizenship, race, [gender](gender.md)) if they lean *very* [leftward](politics-leftism.md) politically.

Outside of acting roles, photographs are a bad idea:

- Many employers may create prejudices about your appearance.
- If they see a photo, employers might fear legal discrimination and won't offer an interview.

## Add the correct keywords

Try to mirror the writing style and choice of words from job postings inside your industry.

Whenever possible, add relevant words into the body of the work instead of writing a list:

- You're trying to get past a computerized system that looks for *all* the words, so liberally add industry-specific words everywhere.
- Avoid general terms for skills (e.g., don't put "MS Office" when the job posting states "knowledge of Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, etc.").
- If it helps, make a list beforehand of all the words you want to use, then check them off as you insert them into the document's sentences.

## Speak as plainly as possible

As much as possible, avoid florid or cliché writing.

Pass up arbitrary self-promoting terms:

- Profit-focused
- Savvy
- Senior-level
- Strategic
- Strong

Avoid overused phrases, vague words or words that imply inexperience or inability:

- Aggressive
- Detail-oriented
- Develop
- Experience working in...
- First
- Flexible
- Goal-oriented
- Hard-working
- Myself, me, I
- Need
- Proactive
- Problem-solving skills
- Professional
- Reliable
- Responsible for...
- Team player
- Anything that sounds like [business jargon](http://www.theofficelife.com/business-jargon-dictionary-A.html)

Find more creative ways to label your titles than the standard "Objective" or "Work History"

Save time by making a "boilerplate" résumé to adjust to each employer's needs, and keep at least two types available:

- One filled with the jargon that gets it past the applicant tracking system (ATS)
- Another one without the jargon to give to someone who actually knows what you'll be doing.

## Personal profile

Personal profiles must be neat and tidy because they're the first thing the recruiter sees.

Use the first 1/3 of the résumé to show core strengths in an attractive and seamless format, then the rest should echo those strengths (like a persuasive essay).

Name and contact information:

- Include a website or social network handle if it showcases your preferred image.
- If you're moving or applying to a job in a different town, use a local city and phone number.
- It's an identity theft risk and not relevant to the employer, so do *not* give your street address.

Many people make the objective a general statement of what they want:

- Use prior facts to state how your skills can benefit the company.
- Your statement should directly address the hiring manager, not the industry or type of job.
  - Avoid listing industries you've worked in.
- Clarify *exactly* what you want to do at their job, not simply a long-term desire or vague goal.

## Work history

The truth will come out, so do *not* exaggerate your titles and responsibilities.

Recruiters can easily research the jobs you've had, so the work history shouldn't be a list of tasks and responsibilities.

The work history should use common themes to tell an unfinished story that supports the objective and skills.

Specify each job's performance in 2-3 bullet points by clarifying who, what, and how many:

- Describe the experience's result, outcome or benefit, and use numbers whenever possible.
- You're trying to direct your job's achievements toward your general aptitude, *not* to brag about how well you did.
- The résumé should tell a story that you've already succeeded and will succeed with the next role.

Use action verbs to tell the story:

- **Communication**: addressed, advised, answered, apprised, arbitrated, assessed, authored, briefed, clarified, communicated, composed, conducted, constructed, consulted, contacted, conveyed, corresponded, counseled, critiqued, deciphered, deliberated, demonstrated, developed, documented, drafted, edited, educated, elaborated, explained, facilitated, familiarized, formulated, guided, handled, illustrated, informed, instructed, interpreted, interviewed, introduced, lectured, led, mediated, moderated, negotiated, officiated, planned, prepared, presented, projected, promoted, proofread, publicized, published, reconciled, recorded, recruited, reported, responded, scheduled, screened, spoke, solicited, summarized, synthesized, taught, trained, translated, updated, wrote
- **Creative**: acted, arranged, authored, composed, conceived, conceptualized, conducted, created, designed, developed, devised, directed, edited, envisioned, established, fashioned, formulated, illustrated, initiated, integrated, invented, launched, modernized, orchestrated, originated, performed, planned, presented, produced, revitalized, revolutionized, shaped, stimulated, visualized
- **Helping**: aided, assessed, assisted, attended, coached, collaborated, comforted, contributed, counseled, educated, empowered, facilitated, fostered, guided, helped, instilled, mediated, mentored, moderated, provided, recommended, reconciled, rectified, referred, rehabilitated, screened, settled, supported, translated, treated, tutored
- **Leadership**: administered, advocated, appointed, approved, assigned, authorized, conducted, consolidated, contracted, coordinated, counseled, defined, delegated, determined, developed, diagnosed, directed, disseminated, elected, enforced, enlisted, ensured, evaluated, examined, executed, explained, formed, founded, governed, guided, headed, hired, implemented, improved, increased, influenced, initiated, inspired, installed, instituted, instructed, integrated, launched, led, managed, mentored, mobilized, modeled, moderated, monitored, negotiated, operated, originated, oversaw, pioneered, planned, presided, prioritized, processed, produced, promoted, recommended, recruited, represented, reorganized, resolved, responded, reviewed, secured, spearheaded, sponsored, staged, started, streamlined, strengthened, supervised, taught, trained
- **Marketing**: arbitrated, attained, augmented, boosted, broadened, calculated, centralized, consulted, convinced, decreased, developed, dissuaded, documented, educated, ensured, established, exceeded, excelled, expanded, expedited, familiarized, gained, generated, identified, implemented, improved, increased, influenced, integrated, launched, led, maintained, marketed, mediated, negotiated, performed, persuaded, produced, promoted, proposed, publicized, published, purchased, researched, resolved, revamped, revitalized, secured, sold, solicited, strengthened, supplemented
- **Organization**: allocated, appointed, arranged, assembled, balanced, cataloged, charted, clarified, collected, compiled, consolidated, coordinated, detailed, developed, disseminated, distributed, ensured, examined, executed, explained, formalized, formed, implemented, indexed, initiated, installed, maintained, measured, minimized, monitored, operated, organized, planned, prepared, prioritized, processed, recorded, reorganized, routed, scheduled, set goals, sorted, surveyed, streamlined, strengthened, updated
- **Technical**: administered, analyzed, applied, assessed, audited, charted, classified, compiled, computed, concluded, conducted, consulted, deciphered, designed, detected, developed, devised, diagnosed, discovered, documented, drafted, edited, evaluated, examined, expanded, extracted, formed, formulated, gathered, generated, identified, improved, increased, inspected, installed, instituted, integrated, interfaced, interpreted, interviewed, investigated, launched, maintained, measured, operated, organized, programmed, reduced, researched, restored, reviewed, searched, streamlined, summarized, surveyed, systemized, tabulated, tested, wrote
- **Teaching**: adapted, advised, assessed, assigned, challenged, clarified, coached, communicated, coordinated, defined, demonstrated, designed, developed, diagnosed, educated, encouraged, enriched, established, evaluated, facilitated, fostered, guided, identified, informed, inspired, trained

Omit work experience that implies you're a bad fit for the role:

- Unless your work made a significant impact, omit anything less than a few months long.
- Only go back as far as 3-5 years, and avoid including old jobs that draw out the résumé length.

## Other history

Put your education before your employment history only if you haven't been employed before, or you're seeking a teacher role.

While a career-relevant hobby on your résumé will *really* set you apart, only list hobbies and volunteer information that directly apply to the job.

Don't share anything that could bias a recruiter against you (e.g., your [religion](religion-answers.md), age, marital status, children), and save those details for the interview if you want to share them.

Unless you're still going to it or working for it, don't include your high school:

- *Any* college experience heavily implies you graduated from high school already.
- If you *didn't* graduate high school, take 1 affordable college class to dramatically change your image.

You can share skills through your Work History, but some skills won't associate with a previous job and you may need a Skills section:

- Only include hard skills (e.g., foreign languages, software programs) and avoid soft skills (e.g., leadership, communication) in a Skills section, since those should be part of your work history.
- If the job you're applying for requests a skill you don't have, spend a few hours self-educating on that skill and include it in your résumé.

Add *all* relevant "education":

- You can typically add simple one-off online courses, even if you didn't get an official certificate but had finished the coursework.
- If you need more, take a day or two to pass a few online which interest you and are mildly related.

If you have a few relevant volunteer roles, add a Volunteer Work section.

## Cleaning up the résumé

Keep the résumé length no longer than 2 pages, but preferably 1:

- While a résumé can be more than one page, it should correspond with how much relevant work experience you have.
- You will likely need to pad out your 1 page at the beginning of your career, but after about 4 jobs you'll probably need to drop a *lot* of information off to get to a page, and probably even more after another decade to get to 2.

Work hard on your formatting:

- Half of a résumé's presentation is formatting and design.
- Imitate résumés in your target industry.
- Use easily readable serif fonts like Georgia over Times New Roman.
- Set line spacing to 120% of the font size.
- Since they make the reader's eyes wander, avoid indentations.
- Make the formatting more visually appealing with visuals like timelines or graphic elements.

Add web links to other records of your success:

- Online portfolios
- Writing samples
- Professional social media profiles like [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Consider a video résumé link to distinguish yourself:
  - Keep the video short.
  - Describe why you bring value to the position.
  - Explain why you're the best fit for the job.
  - Use a storytelling format.
  - Take the time to do it right before uploading.
  
Double and triple check for errors:

- *Any* writing with typographical errors or lousy formatting looks unprofessional.
- Observe present and past tense throughout the document.
- Ask people for feedback on your [writing style](language-writing.md).

Save your finished résumé in three file formats:

- PDF - Unless specified otherwise, always send PDF to avoid formatting errors from the reader's side.
- DOC/DOCX/ODS - Many job portals can't process PDF.
- TXT - Some job portals want the résumé copy-pasted into a text box.
