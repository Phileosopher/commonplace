Listen With Serious Intent 
In the third chapter of Exodus, before Moses is called on before God to act as a leader of his people, Moses is tending to his flock, and he notices something glistening in the periphery of his vision. He takes the time to deviate from his path, to investigate it, and to pay attention to this phenomenon that captures his interest. 
As Moses gets closer, he can see it is a living form — a bush that is on fire. That is a strange paradox because a bush that is on fire would burn into ashes; bushes do not just continually burn. Although, in some sense, they actually do because living things are on fire in that they oxidize and transform. Everything living is like that. 
Everything living is a combination of being and becoming. That is particularly obvious in the case for living things, but it is also true for everything because nothing is static in its form. It is what it is, and it is what it is going to be. The burning bush is being and transformation at the same time, paradoxical and compelling. It is static because it still has this treelike form (which is emblematic of life), and it is burning. 
Then, a voice speaks to Moses from the bush and tells him to stop because he is beginning to tread on holy ground. What would happen if you listened seriously? If you listened — and listened seriously — the person to whom you are listening would reveal themselves more. People will tell you everything, including things you do not even want to know. If people are not telling you, then you are not listening because they will reveal themselves more deeply, whether it be your wife or husband, a friend, anyone. And if you think the people around you are not that interesting, then you are not listening. If you were, you might come to understand that people are no shortage of interesting.

## Art of Communication
Don't make important decisions alone
Don't cut communication, don't go away, don't flee
When you communicate a hard decision, don't hide behind emails, talk directly to your audience
Use the [SBI tool](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm) (Situation - Behavior - Impact)
Assertiveness is ability to say yes to the person, no to the task
:star: Prepare, verify carefully what you will communicate
Check if your message has been heard and understood
Expect / Give feedback
Set the main idea first
Avoid passive constructions
Be open minded, don't think you know everything about your audience
Use the body language (physical and visual contact, ...)
Stay calm : Wrap up then stop talking. Pause. Repeat. Ask clarification of a statement. Be clear.
Look for humor.
Look for compromise if the other cares about something not important for you
Agree to disagree : take beak so everyone calms down
Assert yourself : express (negative) opinions and needs positively. Ask for help. Learn from errors. Accept feedback. Say no
Observe rather than interpret. Communicate facts not interpretations
Understand people's needs/feelings
Use non violent communication

## Art of Questions
Just ask
Explain your misunderstanding
Explain / state what you know / don't know
Sound confident
Have a come back
Know first which answer type you're expecting : Opinion ? Factually correct answer ? Well reasoned judgment ?
Avoid "yes" or "no" questions
Dig deeper (5 Why...)
Use the power of silence
Don't interrupt
Prepare the topic (know a bit what you are talking about)
Check your assumptions (are you sure about what you think you know ?)
Find the right person to ask
Use correct grammar
Keep the question simple
Differentiate between open (Why ?) vs closed (when ? who ?) question types
Explain why you are asking
