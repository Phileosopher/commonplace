Whether a disaster was man-made or natural, it's utterly devastating to experience the loss of your [home](home-housekeeping.md) or all your possessions:

- It's even *more* difficult if you've only lost a significant chunk of your things because it's easy to imagine the rest going just as quickly.

The trauma will likely follow you for years, so accept the shock as a part of your life for a while.

Try to rebuild, and consider [how to protect yourself](safety-security.md) the next time it may happen.

Focus on the present moment and individual [tasks](success-4_routine.md), and you'll get through it in time.

## How to handle theft, burglaries, and mugging

When people steal things from you, you'll likely feel a sense of anger about it.

- The things you valued have now been unfairly taken.
- Very often, you'll never see those things again, even if [insurance](insurance.md) pays you at least partly for the damages.

However, compared to many other things, your possessions aren't that important.

- If nobody gets hurt, you and those you love are fortunate.
- What you're likely *more* upset about than losing your possessions is the feeling that someone can violate your boundaries so inconsiderately.

You can't do anything about what you've lost, so learn to be [safer](safety-security.md) for the future and learn to [forgive and release](happiness-stress.md).

## How to handle surviving a war

In many ways, surviving a war is a combination of witnessing a [mass murder](hardship-death.md) *and* a man-made disaster at the same time.

Irrespective of whether you were military or a civilian, you will probably have [trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) about it for decades:

- Beyond other war survivors, nobody else will fully comprehend what you've experienced.
- Even worse, people who don't know will often portray you or your enemies (depending on who "won") as heroic.

To prevent the trauma from destroying you, find [creative ways](mind-creativity.md) to build the experiences you keep reliving into something useful.

As much as possible, try to put the experiences behind you:

- If your home was damaged, rebuild it or move.
- If you were in a foreign war and have trouble with others' opinions of it, go somewhere you'll be accepted.
