when in the presence of a compulsive liar:

1. be boring, look disinterested in their story
2. try to change the subject by asking a question that redirects attention
3. if all else fails, find an excuse to get away from them

calling out their lies is a waste of time

- they feel entitled to lie, and they won't like your correction because it calls them out
- however, you can definitely have fun with them with the following:
  1. talk about something you're very familiar with, but without expressing your full interest
  2. let them spin a story for a while that is clearly made-up and wrong
  3. ask them how their story can be true when a fact you are entirely certain of is true
     - "Oh, you won silver in curling in last year's Winter Olympics? I have a cousin who won the bronze! What did you think of the Winner's Lounge?"

if the eye thing were true, interrogations would take seconds, not days or weeks
