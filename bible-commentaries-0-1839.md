# Bible commentaries list up to 1839

There are a *lot* of English-language Bible commentaries.

- Nearly every generation has at least one influential person who will work through the entire Bible.
- While most of them become lost to time in one way or another, some of them survive to be nearly as accessible as the Bible itself.

However, for a variety of reasons, the commentator may not be who you want.

This is a summarized attempt to keep track of the commentaries by answering a few simple questions:

1. Who wrote it, and approximately what window of time would it have been written?
2. What theological basis or denomination was the author?
   - You can certainly read outside your denomination (and it can help to gain a deeper understanding through the diversity of [our gifts and roles](spiritual-gifts.md)).
   - Many [philosophies](philosophy.md) and [beliefs](glossary-philosophy-christian.md) across the [lens of Christian history](history-church.md) have a *profound* effect on how you'll see the finer details of [Scripture](bible.md).
   - For the sake of your [workflow](success-4_routine.md), some opinions and approaches may impede your research into a [Bible study](bible-study.md) or [sermon](mgmt-church.md).
3. What type of commentary is it?
   - **Exegetical** (aka Word) works to give technical details tied to the original [language](language.md) and its [meaning](meaning.md).
   - **Expository** (aka Homiletical) work toward applying the Bible to everyday life and designed to help with making a sermon.
     - They are useful to get a context, but can *quickly* create [conflicts](people-conflicts-christian-why.md) around others' opinions more than the actual text.
     - **Devotional** are reading-focused mini-essays on verses or passages.
     - **Critical** commentaries look at various perspectives, so they end up becoming commentaries on commentaries.
     - **Cultural** is built to give [historical context](people-culture.md) around when the text was written.
   - **Sermonic** (aka Pastoral or Application) are essentially reworked sermons, so they end up as a hybrid of both exegetical and expository.
   - **Holistic** (aka Connective or Associative) focuses on Bible verse connections with other Bible verses.
   - **Summary** focuses on a TL;DR summary of the content.
   - Commentary categories sit more on a "spectrum" between exegetical and expository, and it's sometimes difficult to precisely analyze.
4. What is the scope of books the commentary covers?
   - The commentary may range itself on a spectrum between the whole Bible and a single book.
   - More specific implies that it will have more in-depth analysis and clear application, but that all depends on the quality of the commentator's work.
5. Where can I find that commentary?

Also, the abundance of links to that particular work may give some hint on how popular it has been among Christians. If it's difficult to find online, it is likely either [heresy](people-conflicts-christian-why.md) or its creators are [violating the spirit of the Bible through intellectual property trolling](https://theologos.site/ip/) and not worth existing on this page.

It's sorted by year of approximate publication.

- It's only reasonable that many Bible commentators have pulled from prior commentators, *especially* within the same or parent denomination.
- Almost every pastor or theologian will effectively make *new* commentary as they teach, so by design this *can't* be an exhaustive list.
