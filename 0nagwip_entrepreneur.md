Entrepreneur is a French word literally translated as someone who "enters into [an undertaking](https://gainedin.site/social-risk/)" into business for themselves.

- They *must* take legitimate [risks](/risk-mgmt/) to advance their [organization](https://gainedin.site/groups-small/).
- A small business requires the same amount of consistent, steady maintenance as a [baby](https://adequate.life/parenting-1).

Outside of [parenting](https://adequate.life/parenting-2/), a small business is the largest personal sacrifice a person can ever make.

- The sacrifice will require at least four years of obsessive devotion, with the possibility of *decades* of retirement afterward.

## Disposition

Almost everyone is capable of being an entrepreneur, but not everyone has the [personality](https://gainedin.site/personality/) that they'd *enjoy* it:

- Since they'll likely have to do a little of [*all* the business skills](/business/), they must have a high enough Openness to Experience to learn domains like [taxes](/accounting/), researching [regulations](/legal-doctrines/), and negotiating with a [supplier](/logistics/).
- They must be Conscientious enough to make sacrifices, [productively get work done](https://adequate.life/success-4/) *before* it must be done, and [pay bills on time](https://adequate.life/money-3/), but not so much that they're a perfectionist.
- While it varies on the industry, they must be Extraverted enough to steadily, consistently [connect](https://adequate.life/speaking/) with dozens to hundreds of strangers.
- They must be low-enough Agreeableness to both [negotiate better prices](https://adequate.life/conflicts/) and resist the [conflicts](https://gainedin.site/conflicts/) they create from disregarding [social fashions](https://gainedin.site/trends/), *especially* against [large-scale systems](https://gainedin.site/bad-systems/) who will suppress their [rise to power](https://gainedin.site/power/).
- Their Neuroticism must be high enough to [make creative connections](https://gainedin.site/creativity/), but not enough that it interferes with their ability to get work done.

They also must be stubborn enough to indefinitely face [criticism](https://adequate.life/conflicts/), [failure](https://adequate.life/success-1/), [obstacles](https://adequate.life/success-5/), and the ever-present [unknown](https://gainedin.site/unknown/).

- It's practically a requirement to adopt an abnormally high tolerance for [social risks](https://gainedin.site/social-risk/).
- They'll need to constantly seek out guidance from mentors and associates.
- Typically, they'll have a natural ability to see strengths where most people see weaknesses.

Most of them are inherently curious.

- They tend to ask probing and profound [questions](understanding.md), even seemingly stupid ones, about absolutely everything.
- Typically, they're trying to find [creative](https://gainedin.site/creativity/) ways to [break existing norms](https://gainedin.site/taboo/).

However, unlike philosophers or educators, they're also extremely practical.

- That practical approach means they're typically antagonistic toward [bureaucracy](/bureaucracy/) and [large systems](https://gainedin.site/groups-large/).
- They're fixated more on currently available resources than building large-scale systems.
- Many of them will have a strange enjoyment out of finding ways to overcome, minimize or calculate [risks](/risk-mgmt/).

Finally, they generally must be humble enough to accept what they don't know.

- If they're older, they'll need to follow the trends that younger people adopt, meaning they'll have to change their ways.
- If they're younger, they'll need to take the experience and wisdom of older generations.
- They'll have to touch *many* [specialized domains](https://gainedin.site/specialization-cities/), so they'll need to learn when they must simply trust [professionals](/professionals/).

## Skills

They'll have to learn a wide variety of disciplines where they had had zero experience.

- While they can delegate some things (e.g., [lawyer](/legal-dictionary/) or [accountant](/accounting/)), the beginning stages of their business will require them to [understand](understanding.md) at least a general working concept of most parts of their organization.

Determination - more than anything else, they must be focused.

- They will face against a plethora of opposition, ranging from existential (e.g., friends who don't think they'll succeed) to practical (e.g., much larger companies start trying to compete with them).
- That determination, over time, will express as a type of relentlessness toward what they want.

Flexibility - against determination, they must be able to adapt.

- Relentlessness alone isn't useful, and they'll get shut down quickly if they don't pivot to where the opportunities are sitting.
- Success porn like "don't give up on your dreams" is foolish, since they'll have to modify their dreams at a moment's notice.

Imagination - they must be able to think [creatively](https://adequate.life/creativity/).

- Intelligence counts because it defines how easily they can [think of new ideas](https://gainedin.site/creativity/).
- In many circles, their cleverness will be seen as mild insanity.

Deviance - they need to have a rebellious streak.

- While they do care about [morality](https://gainedin.site/morality/), they don't care as much about [social standards](https://adequate.life/social-rules/).

Friendship - it's a *huge* advantage if they know [how to get along with others](https://adequate.life/people-3/).

- Their ability to coexist and work together becomes *much* more significant once they have partners.
- Irrespective of their social skills, an entrepreneur will be preoccupied with how they can fulfill others' needs.
- Many of them are also [natural leaders](/mgmt/), even if nobody follows them.

Independence - they'll have to do almost everything themselves, at least at first.

- Paying others for what you can do yourself will impede your ability to make a profit.
- Building a business from the ground up requires a *lot* of toil, and is a dramatic exercise in [self-improvement](https://adequate.life/) from all angles.

## Purpose

Some motivations *can't* sustain an entrepreneur's drive:

- If someone severely resents working for an employer, they'll resent working with clients and will often alienate potential opportunities.
- The desire to simply become rich is ill-placed in entrepreneurship, since most entrepreneurs are paid *less* than employees who do mostly the same job.
- Wanting to please someone else won't work, since starting a business is *not* an easy decision.

In general, self-employment is *not* as high-paying as an employee equivalent.

- When you work as an employee, you're typically in a *much* more [specialized role](https://gainedin.site/specialization-cities/), meaning people are generally more inclined to pay you more for that work.
- You also don't have to think about unrelated domains to your work (e.g., [accounting](/accounting/), [management](/mgmt/), [sales](/marketing/)).

An entrepreneur must be driven by a self-determined [purpose](https://gainedin.site/purpose/) to achieve.

- They typically have plenty of confidence in their skills.
- They have to find [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) in their work, even when it's completely unrelated to making money.

Entrepreneurs typically succeed when they want to build a community.

- To accomplish the wide variety of tasks they'll need to do, they will *need* to foster community with other people.
- The prevalence of social interaction means they'll have to find at least some [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) from working with others.

## Lifestyle

The disposition of an entrepreneur means they tend to have a few lifestyle elements in common:

- Loves [sports](/sports/), especially team or extreme sports.
- Loves [traveling](https://adequate.life/vacations-trips/) to original, exotic places.
- Typically [self-taught](understanding.md), but often not much [college education](https://adequate.life/college/).
- Often obsessively focused on whatever task they're performing.
- Spends their free time [learning](https://gainedin.site/pedagogy/), [absorbing information](understanding.md), or [mastering a fun skill](https://adequate.life/fun/).

For several reasons, entrepreneurs are typically [young](https://gainedin.site/maturity/).

- They have fewer commitments, and therefore less to [risk](/risk-mgmt/) to the [unknown](https://gainedin.site/unknown/).
- They're typically not bitter about most of society's [large systems](https://gainedin.site/bad-systems/).
- Their mind is more prone to entertaining silly things which may become a good [business idea](/entrepreneur-idea/).
- They'll have more enthusiasm toward a new idea from a general lack of awareness over future risks.

They typically won't be inclined toward creature comforts and luxuries.

- They won't be fixated on money as much as what more money can *do* for them.
- In the formative phases of a small organization, even [small expenses](https://adequate.life/saving/) can ruin its [financial health](/accounting/).

Many disciplines parallel an entrepreneur's, and most of them typically visit at least some of them:

- [Creative](https://gainedin.site/creativity/) performance fields like musicians and actors.
- Professional [writers](https://adequate.life/writing/), especially fiction writers.
- [Media](https://gainedin.site/storytellers/) professionals and [public speakers](https://adequate.life/speaking/).
- [Leaders](/mgmt/) in nonprofit organizations or churches.
- [Homeschooling](/homeschool/) [parents](https://adequate.life/parenting-2/).
