## Who cares about sleep?

We spend close to 1/3 of our lives sleeping.

If someone isn’t getting enough sleep, improving sleep is the most dramatic lifestyle improvement.

Staying well-rested has many, many benefits:

- Physically [healthier](body-4_health.md)
- More [attractive](people-2_image.md)
- Better [memory](mind-memory.md)
- Generally [happier](happiness-1_why.md)
- More energy
- [Family and friends](people-4_friends.md) are happier because all the above makes you a generally better person to be around

Sleeping allows the body to heal and washes out waste from the brain.

- This means that sleep affects everything connected to thinking or the nervous system.
- Typically, if you can’t figure out your problem, you likely need more sleep.

Your mattress and pillow doesn’t have much effect on your sleep:

- Your mental state and surrounding environment determine more about your sleep than what you’re sleeping on.
- You can sleep fine as long as you’re on something relatively soft.
- A pillow will be more comfortable, but [*not* using a pillow can fix plenty of joint and back pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/).

## Sleep has four stages

Stage 1:

- Slower brain waves and eyes start slowly rolling.
- Easy to wake someone in this stage.
- Muscles may jerk involuntarily.
- Transitioning in and out of this stage may feel like falling.

Stage 2:

- The first actual stage of "sleep".
- Specific brain wave spikes (sleep spindles) and structures (K complexes).
- Slower heart rate and lower body temperature.

Stage 3:

- The most restorative sleep cycle.
- Also known as "deep sleep".
- Waking someone from this stage is near-impossible.
- People usually don’t wake on their own from this stage.
- This stage is when most sleep disorders happen (e.g., night terrors, sleepwalking, sleep talking).

REM (rapid eye movement) sleep:

- The eyes move quickly back and forth.
- Typically, the stage where we experience [dreams](sleep-dreams(data).md).
- People waking during REM cycles will feel groggy and overly sleepy.

Good sleep persists through a general pattern:

1. Transition through Stages 1 and 2.
2. Move to REM after about 90 minutes.
3. Cycle back to Stage 3 after 10 minutes.
4. Shift back-and-forth between Stage 3 and REM, with longer REM cycles each time.
5. The sleep concludes with naturally waking up by phasing through Stages 2 and 1.

We can’t directly control sleep cycles, but we can typically alter them if we tell ourselves to wake up at a set time.

## Circadian rhythm

Each person has one of three natural patterns (chronotypes):

1. Morning people (early chronotype) - 10% of the population, where productivity peaks at 9 a.m.
2. Night owls (late chronotype) - 20% of the population, where productivity peaks at 9 p.m.
3. Mid-day (intermediate chronotype) - 70% of the population, with varying productivity across the day.

Learn how much sleep you require.

- Track when you naturally sleep with a sleep monitor app.
- Falling asleep within five minutes of lying down is a sign of sleep deprivation.

To completely reset your sleep cycle:

1. Stop eating for 12–16 hours.
2. Eat when you want to wake up.
3. Carry on through the day and fall asleep at your preferred time.

### Sleep schedules

You have [many sensible sleep cycles](sleep-cycles(data).md) to choose from.

- The body doesn’t need *hours* of sleep, just sleep *cycles*.
- Each sleep cycle without training lasts about 1.5–2 hours, and doesn’t need to be in order.
- Depending on your lifestyle, changing your cycles can enhance your [creativity](mind-creativity.md) or [productivity](success-4_routine.md).
- However, with any sleep cycle, there are still risks to [mental health](awareness.md) by staying up late.

If your sleep schedule gets disrupted, you may have to find a way to [resist insomnia](sleep-insomnia(data).md).

## Naps

The older people get, the less time they require for naps.

Healthy adults who don’t get enough sleep should take naps.

10–20 minute naps:

- Only engages in lighter sleep stages and is non-REM.
- Ideal for a boost in alertness and energy, and very useful for [finding creative answers](mind-creativity.md) and [quick re-focusing](success-4_routine.md).

According to NASA, the perfect nap should last 26 minutes:

- Taking coffee right before a nap guarantees waking up 20–30 minutes later.
- Half-hour naps may cause sleep inertia (a groggy feeling that feels like a hangover) for up to 30 minutes after waking up.

60-minute naps:

- Hour-long naps are best for [recalling facts, faces, and names](mind-memory.md).
- An hour-long nap induces Stage 3 sleep.

90-minute naps:

- A full sleep cycle with all four stages that typically avoids sleep inertia.
- Leads to improved [creativity](mind-creativity.md) and better procedural and emotional [memory](mind-memory.md).

Sitting slightly upright prevents deep sleep.

Depending on the sleep cycle, the ideal napping time is typically between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m.

- Napping too late in the day or for over 20 minutes can interfere with sleep cycles.

If you can’t nap, laughing for 15 minutes has the same psychological effects as getting 2 hours of sleep.
