# Insomnia cures

Usually, if you can’t sleep, your day probably didn’t have enough [work](success-4_routine.md), [learning](mind-memory.md), or [meaningful interactions](people-conversation.md).

## Routines

Wake up at the same time every morning.

- If you wake up before your alarm goes off, your body’s natural clock has woken you, so don't go back to bed.
- It takes a week to shift a sleeping pattern, but one missed day will revert it, so avoid binge-sleeping on weekends.

Drink plenty of water.

[Exercise](body-3_exercise.md) regularly.

- As little as 10 minutes a day can set a sleep pattern.

Make a wind-down routine:

- At day’s end, de-stress and [meditate](awareness-meditation.md).
- Listen to the same song every time you’re tired, then play it back when you can’t sleep.
- Create a bedtime routine of pajamas and a cup of tea in bed at a reliable time.
- Set a strict "screens off" time 1–2 hours before bedtime.
