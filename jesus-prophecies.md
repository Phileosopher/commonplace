# List of prophecies fulfilled through Jesus

This is a non-exhaustive list of Jesus' fulfilled prophecies.

- Many of them are simply [mythological patterns](bible-patterns.md) from other domains.
- There are many more, but many of them require associating even more patterns to find them.

The chances of even *some* of Jesus' prophecies happening, with their predictions laid out centuries prior, are absurdly unlikely to be pure coincidence.

- As a statistical estimate, fulfilling 8 of the prophecies would be about 1:10^17.
