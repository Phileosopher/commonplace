# Scaling a tech entrepreneurship

You may have [an amazing business idea](entrepreneur-2_idea-cs.md), and may have even been working it as a [side hustle](entrepreneur-4_freelancing-cs.md), but how do you prove that this thing will make enough money that someone would want to invest?

To start with, you need to prove that you're legitimate. Very often, [scams prey on new trends like blockchain](https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html). This is where your [social skills](people-why.md) become important.

But, more importantly, you must demonstrate that you'll make the "venture capitalists" money or, in a "not-for-profit" (NPO), legitimately change something for the better. You might get lucky and become a "unicorn" (with a company value surpassing $1 billion), but it's more likely that you'll have a long, hard road ahead.
