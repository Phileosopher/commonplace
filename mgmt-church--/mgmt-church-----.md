#### religiousness

the product of a fakeness of religious practices is an individual phoniness, but has a more sinister problem:
- a culture that maintains it ends up setting an informal false standard of true Christian piety
- in all reality, a Christian who prays once a month, but does it straight from the heart, is doing more with their relationship with God than someone who is doing the same and LYING about how much they do it
- but, the liar will receive the praise, and the culture will become more phony
- instead, the weakest should be praised the most for their weak efforts, since they're the ones who have the hardest challenge regarding changing their [habits]

When Christian leadership advocates for people to be more devoted to particular moral crusades (e.g., maritally faithful, politically involved, missionary-investing) and not centrally focusing on imcreasing love for one another, they invariably MUST lead to propagandizing to get that message across (e.g., awful Christian movies, religious jargon), and the central message of the entire church becomes a hollow shell.

Christian leadership who ramble incessantly about spiritualish-sounding things are weakening the Body. Unless a Christian is feeling provoked to better action when they leave their congregation, the Body suffers.

#### responding to modern culture

Congregational churches
- [Congregationalism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalism)
- it was a movement
- we need a new DE-congregationalism that reflects the new technologies available

The good ways a Church can be progressive:
Incorporate (some) Masses with contemporary music
Create ministries that will engage with young people
Evolve the youth groups into a place more kids might want to go
Create ministries for families to better

 educate their children in the Church in more captivating ways

​The bad ways a Church can be progressive:
Anything that is against established Church dogma and doctrines

One simple solution to the world's evils (e.g., Pride month) is to make your own holiday.
- It's how Christmas began: celebrating an alternative to the secular world's evils.

The open-source and creative commons licenses show the hypocrisy of the Church at large
- Sending out information that legitimately changes lives should be free
- By holding it hostage behind a paywall, it impedes the poor from getting it (least of these verse)
- In fact, many of the books are quickly released ON PURPOSE, since them sticking around for a few years means they'll get easily distributed

- this group is being MORE selfless than many sects of Christianity

the layperson is FAR more qualified now with the internet than ever before
- An entire seminary's worth of information, and thousands of years of history, accessible within SECONDS
- the need for research to find answers on key information goes from hours to MINUTES
- this can only be magnified with [AI] assistance
- to that end, the ordained clergy is a bit like [college professors]: a relic of a past era before the [over-information age]
- plus, people in the trades have 1 unique advantage: their [specialization] that bleeds into their ministry (and [influences] the Body at large in the process)
- this means moving away from personality-driven churches into models (i.e., frameworks, not libraries)

Technology has its place
- https://news.gab.com/2023/05/the-roundtable-amish-insights-on-technology-pt-1/
- the misunderstanding is that tech is somehow bad, but it's nothing more or less than raw [power]

#### weak culture

Most Christian culture REALLY doesn't like to [integrate their shadow].
- It's easier to repress than work with it.
- God designed our personalities AS THEY ARE, and we must know the time and place for them.
- However, most Christian leadership becomes its own [cultural group], with its rules and standards being over-ordered from the intentionally vague components God placed down for EVERYONE to follow
- It can't be fixed completely, since any long-term efforts to do it "right" will be faced by [power games] and corruption, and any [legacy] will be shot down by the spongy-headed babies who eventually grow up to replace them

In societies without [persecution](https://theologos.site/persecution/), the [leadership](https://theologos.site/leadership/) will often become complacent, and persecution has a tendency to rapidly cycle leadership as they're incarcerated or killed.
- For that reason, persecuted churches don't risk the leaders' personality interfering with God's work as much.
- Spiritually young Christians who worship their pastor take away from the worship experience.
