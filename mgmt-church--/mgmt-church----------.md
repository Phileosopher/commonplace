#### Sabbath

A Christian who goes to church and reads their Bible against their desires is NOT taking the Sabbath correctly.
- going to church if you're an introvert may actually be defying the Sabbath
- reading your Bible when you're not a "reading books" type may be defying the Sabbath

Hi!

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "traditions".

As a BAPTIST, from EASTERN CANADA, who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, in mostly English language
urban life - I have church traditions that reflect those things.
These range from architecture, arrangement of the sanctuary, language
used in the pulpit, musical styles, professional expectations, church
management, church government, theological perspectives and so much
more.

To me, traditions are the
habits we get into by accident and by planning, and we stay with them
because they give easy answers to practical needs.

To use a "non church example", Alcoholics Anonymous has "12 steps and [12 traditions](https://www.aa.org/the-twelve-traditions).

> The
> Twelve Traditions provide guidelines for relationships between the
> groups, members, the global Fellowship and society at large. Questions
> of finance, public relations, donations and purpose are addressed in the
> Traditions.

With that understanding of traditions and their purpose, lets look at a few.

- Architecture - most Baptists understand their "church building" as a more of a
    "meeting house" than as a cathedral or temple. The people who follow
    Jesus are the Church (literally, the Bible translates ἐκκλησίαν which
    means congregation or assembly as church see [Matthew 16](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/matthew/16.htm):18)
- Catholics have the Mass as the central part of their worship, so the table (altar) is at the centre. Baptists have the pulpit and the Bible at the centre stage because their focus is the Bible teaching and the preaching. In an Orthodox church the artwork displays God's glory.
- Local church government is a big deal for us. I grew up in youth groups where we learned to
    make decisions together and choose where to spend our time, effort and
    resources. This is the same for each congregation. As a pastor I get
    one vote, just like every other member of our congregation. People with a history of wisdom and good character have influence, but only one
    vote. This makes it easier for younger people to change the direction
    of the church if they care to be involved.
- Worship styles are mostly set by the people who volunteer to lead. It is easy
    for one volunteer to have a huge influence on the style of worship in
    our form of church.
- There is not much organizational hierarchy in a Baptist church. One church I am pastor of has a "leadership team of 7 people, who meet monthly to
    plan directions and events and finances, and look after everything.
    Today a part of my job is to start the process of hiring 3 summer
    students who will basically work with the rest of our volunteers for
    summer ministry. We have no outside "boss or bishop" to help or
    interfere. The other church I serve as pastor has 2 deacons, and a
    number of volunteers to lead all the ministries.
- Working together with other churches (association principle) is another big
    deal. We work on projects with other churches so we can be more
    effective in ministries. I am in a declining rural community where the
    other churches have basically shut down over the last 50 years. We used to have Catholic, Anglican, United, Pentecostal, 7th Day Adventist, and Presbyterian in our area. We are the last church in this community,
    and the nearest churches in any direction are also a small, rural
    struggling Baptist congregation. Last Friday (Good Friday) we had 7
    different churches meet together for a big celebration.
- Pulpit ministry - One goal of Baptists is to make the Bible teaching clear and accurate. I tend to use two different versions of the Bible in the
    pulpit. [NASB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3&version=NASB) for accuracy, and the [International Children's Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3&version=ICB) for keeping it simple and clear. Baptist churches also tend to do teaching ministries like Sunday School and youth groups.
- Helping ministries - Baptists tend to think helping the poor is a big deal. We do a food pantry with free food to anyone who needs it any time, no
    matter what their circumstance. We also support the local food bank
    which does great work, but might not be as free to help in some bad or
    emergency situations.

I'm sure there are lots more traditions, but time marches on.

#### communion_eucharist

Communion/Eucharist

- can be interpreted as "the" blood and human flesh, or symbolizing it
- like in the Gospel accounts, can be taken in either order
- some people conflate John 6 with the event itself, but it's a ritual to HONOR salvation, not a prerequisite
- the first Church had an actual _meal_ with ritual bread and then-normative-and-diluted wine
    - Thus, Paul's Corinthians letter referred to people being forbidden to eat with the rest of the people
        - Paul admonishes them to eat their nice meal beforehand to not create inequality with the poorer believers
- IDEA: as long as it's sanctified, can be cookies/sweetbread and grape soda/koolaid
    - However, to be purist, you do want bread without yeast (i.e., saltines)
- IDEA: the Eucharist is an addition to the Passover seder, but Jesus could have chosen anything
    - He chose the wine as a symbolic representation of what people used it for: functional, practical, adult enjoyment
    - This means that the solemnity of the Eucharist is probably overblown
- The Protestant view is to repent unconfessed sin before taking it, but that's a Catholic tradition crossover, and Paul NEVER talked about it
    - It's simply the Passover meal with an additional ritual
    - The worser sin in the Corinthian church was to get drunk or forbid people to eat with them (i.e., unloving/divisive)
- There's nothing really "mystical" about the Eucharist/Lord's Supper!

#### conflicts

Religious rituals get battled over: emphasized as either the importance of tradition or insisting they'll alienate new members.

#### Design

Seating

- option: Forward like a lecture

Documentation

- option: Communication cards
    - Alt: lots of dialogue w/ open ppl as leaders

## Weekly Rituals

Worship service

- MUST:
    - some form of group community focus toward God
    - ritualized verbal expression
- CAN:
    - in-person
    - music
        - can be ANY form of music or rhyme
    - 5-1000 minutes
    - mix in unfamiliar elements that retain the same spirit
- CAN'T:
- focus off-topic from God's presence
- constantly new things

## Yearly Rituals

MUST:

- address conventional Christian holidays somehow (e.g., Christmas, Easter)
- address culturally relevant holidays somehow (e.g., Memorial Day, Independence Day)

CAN:

- Lent
    - MUST:
        - focus on the suffering of Christ
        - 40 days of traditional abstinence
    - CAN:
        - have a public Lent service
        - abstinence range: token item all the way to complete ascetic fasting
        - MUST: accommodate the people who can't or won't abstain

CAN'T:

- use shame or guilt to provoke fasting
- imply spiritual "betterness" from it

Tend to the church members' needs MORE than merely evangelism/outreach

- In any large group of individuals, people need certain things (money mgmt, divorce recovery, addiction recovery, parenting problems, marital problems, loss of family/grief recovery, loneliness)
- Attend to these needs first and foremost as a priority
    - Make a system for each, if wanted
    - Make sure someone who is intimately familiar with the problem is running it

One simple idea: offering plate is for needs

- Have the congregants TAKE from the offering plate as well as GIVE
- It puts the faith VERY squarely in God's hands, because it trusts that He will deal with thieves

This is a product of what happens when a culture is [crowdsourced], but there's a poor selection process to weed out people
- the crowd is superior, ONLY IF the manager is choosy

#### early church - Leon Bahrman

What is missed in modern Christianity is the organic nature of the early Church.

What we're used to in our day is the institutional and denominational aspects of Christian expression. And while early traditions have been encapsulized in her sacraments (such as baptism and the eucharist), many things have been lost.

Some organic aspects that some recapture today, but the Church as a whole could do well to relearn are:

1. The close fellowship of home gatherings;
2. The 'love-feast' of sharing meals together;
3. An intimate experience of the divine expressed in ways that are only shared between you and God;
4. The physical contact of laying on of hands, as in healing services;
5. A timelessness in worship, sharing with eternity an abandonment of heart and soul, where no one is looking at their watches;
6. A humility of leadership where the 'greatest among you' is servant of all; And..
7. A sense of family where we can open up to each other, support each other, and pray one for another.

That's just a few things that come readily to my mind. What do you think the early Church had that we could use or incorporate in our church-experience?

#### early church

Over the next few hundred years, they then created their own rituals, bereft of tradition and filled with more accessibility and "relevance":
1. Casual greeters at the narthex before entering.
2. 1-2 modern-ish worship songs being performed.
3. Often, announcements listed off, which often include births/deaths, and often including baptism rituals.
4. 2-4 more modern-ish worship songs performed in the interlude.
5. 15-90 minutes of an expositional or topical homily.
6. Often an evangelistic "altar call" near the end of the service (aka a "Come to Jesus" message), often merged with the ending song's performance.
7. One benediction-style ending song, but often emphasizing solemnity, often including the Lord's Supper/Eucharist, and a formal dismissal.

#### giving

consider the opportunity cost of loving difficult people in an organization
spending $5,000 on a person who MIGHT be manipulative and sacrificing $500 for 10 people who legitimately need it in the process should ONLY be from the Holy Spirit's prompting

Church giving is down when there's a disaster, since everyone gives instead to humanitarian aide

#### homily

Public speaking rules apply even w/ homily
- no opening anecdotes unless they apply directly
- shorter is better, esp. w/ [info] culture w/ internet

there's really no good requirement for a homily
- sometimes it can go for hours
- other times it can be about 5-10 minutes
- there's no real requirement for it to be the same amount every time
- people may only need to hear 1 thing, and brevity may matter to drive that idea home
- don't speak more than you need: if you have 15 minutes of things to say, take 15 minutes and wrap up early

all the aspects of good [pedagogy] apply to good preaching and teaching

#### Lent

Beyond holy week:
- Saint Patrick's and Mardi Gras were "reprieve" days about Lent

#### Sunday worship

The tradition of living well as a Christian requires more attention to how we're serving
- [The Ministry of the Pew: Sunday Morning for Normal Christians | Desiring God](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-ministry-of-the-pew)
- the mainline churches do NOT afford this luxury
    - (OPEN CHURCH MODEL: MEANING COMES FROM RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH IMPLIES CONSTRAINT, WHICH MEANS A GOOD CHURCH STAY SMALL-MODE WITHOUT PERSONALITIES INVOLVED ON A MEGA SCALE)
