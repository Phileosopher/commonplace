### 5 Failures

#### church information

requesting contact information right away is a bit of an invasion of privacy
- they have no idea if they want to be there, or if they have any commitment, so you should ASK them first

#### heresy

heresy isn't mentioned much, if at all, in the Bible
- there are things that should cast people out, sure
- there's plenty in the Bible about false prophets as well
- however, nothing in the Bible indicates heresy overtly

heresy is referring to practices and behavior against established ecumenical standards/protocol
- however, to be loving in Christ, it may actually be the BEST thing to be a heretic sometimes
- in effect, following Jesus means devotion to Him, and that may mean rejection by everyone around you in some instances

heresy, as a practice, is a political bludgeoning device
- by enforcing the mindset of some things and people being utterly [taboo] at all times, there's room for everyone to rally together against the scapegoat for the purpose of "strengthening the Body"
- in practice, this is a highly unloving behavior to the person receiving it, and should only be performed in response to false doctrine and in the hopes that they repent from their false beliefs

technically, Jesus was a Jewish heretic, and that's how Christianity came into existence

#### leadership idolatry

Personality-driven churches are from too much central mgmt
- The product of this is that pastors are required to do what the rest of the world does with [large groups]: be boring and non-dynamic to appeal to the wide range of [personalities] present in the Body
    - The [fashions] shift, though, so the latest trend is to [appear] dynamic even when God made you with the dynamism of an [accountant]

Give away responsibilities whenever possible
- have ppl read Scripture
- give q&a session after the lecture/homily
- have open forums for discussion as part of a church svc

social media influencers and pastors have the same problem: their livelihood is determined by their popularity
you will ALWAYS have this in the back of your mind unless your personality isn't high-agreeableness, which makes you an unlikely candidate for an institutionalized church

Christian leaders have a bad habit of making their writing their "tentmaking".
- However, this is a very bad idea because of the nature of writing. Either the ideas are valuable, and they're putting a paywall against the poorest people who would most likely need that information, or they're saying things that have little spiritual value and they'd probably do better for their reputation getting paid in a marketable trade.

#### members leaving - long-term effects

Some Christians in free societies have rejected the labels for believers (e.g., not using the word "Christian"), but the culture is corrupt, _not_ the name.
- don't run from it: embrace the [sincere spirituality] and show the world that the liars are awful.

#### members leaving

There's one question that most Christians would hate to ask the people who stopped going to church, but if they ask they'd be very uncomfortable:
- If church culture something more legitimately like the ACTUAL way the Bible seems to imply people should live, would your religious paths be different?
- A lot of Christian culture exonerates themselves from responsibility for being Christ-like

when a group mandates that people attend things or they're not "real members", they're performing cult-like activities

In non-persecuted Churches, Christianity creates a few lame stereotypes:
- Music, especially the contemporary genre, vaguely referring to either romantic partners or Jesus and surrounded by consumerism.
- Lame, preachy, poorly shot movies that give sermon illustrations more than stories.
- Clothing [brands](https://gainedin.site/symbols/) that identify a Christian long before they can prove it.
- Church [figures of speech](https://gainedin.site/language/) and sayings that are either unbiblical or theologically confusing to non-believers.
- Using "Christian" to [market](https://gainedin.site/marketing/) a product.
- Weekly observance of a church ritual that doesn't translate to daily life.
- cliche jargon[quotes] that doesn't add any meaning

There are 2 mistakenly applied verses in the Bible:
- do not forsake the fellowship of the siblings
- spur one another to good works
- basically, they assume that promoting the HECK out of their events is doing that
- but, that's more accurately "good events" than "good works"
- and, because of the nature of [social groups](https://icould.fail/groups-small), you never see corporate "fellowship" beyond the size of ~15-20 (though you DO see little one-off aside "fellowship" all over)

(for myself) The simple version, to allay concern, is that on the Big 5 I'm not high-enough Agreeableness to get along with others, too high Openness to Experience to enjoy ritual, and too low Extraversion to enjoy the public assembly
