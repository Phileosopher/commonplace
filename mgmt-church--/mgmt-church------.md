## The Pre-Internet Relic

[Technology](https://gainedin.site/technology/) always changes society, often in profound ways. It brings us closer together, helps us move more stuff faster, makes us more [productive](https://adequate.life/success-4/), and makes life overall easier and more [fun](https://adequate.life/fun/).

But, we often can see the downsides of technology as we get older. Every parent can see what mobile devices do to their children, and our parents saw what television did, and radio the generation before that, and cheap books before _that_. Going all the way back, some of the ancient Greek philosophers of yore bemoaned literacy because it stifled our ability to [remember](https://adequate.life/memory/).

However, the younger people aren't so disposed to that resistance. They _always_ get involved in the new [fashions of the day](https://gainedin.site/trends/).

Because of this, you have two major classes of society that has always played out:

1. An aging population who is resisting all the changes going on.
2. A young population who is advancing the trends as fast as they can.

Naturally, teenagers don't have much power. But, in a decade they're old enough and have built enough [social capital](https://gainedin.site/influence/) to propose [new ways of doing things](https://gainedin.site/creativity/). In two decades they start becoming the new [leadership](https://gainedin.site/groups-small/). Within 3-4 decades _they're_ the "old people", and the formerly old people have found certainty about the afterlife, with their wealth of experience and wisdom either getting transferred as tribal knowledge, encoded in language, or being lost to time.

Social changes happen at the speed of information. We're in the [Over-Information Age](https://stucky.tech/purpose/) now, so information travels at the speed of electricity and radio waves, with the only slowdown to rapid information transfer coming strictly from human perceptual capacity.

But, all this information is still largely void of the [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) that comes from our spirits not having a direct connection with the [One True God](https://icould.fail/god/) or with [others who share that connection](https://icould.fail/church/).

I'm convinced that most of this "empty information" comes from the Church not stepping into this generation's technology. There are several rational reasons why the culture hasn't jived:

1. Church leadership in [the West](https://icould.fail/the-west/) often maintains a far more rigid hierarchical social structure than many other Western cultures. While most companies' "managers" are simply checking in on their charges, many [discipleship-based](https://icould.fail/discipleship/) Bible studies can become extremely involved and, thus, stay relatively inaccessible.
2. There are many heresies, with many silly remixes to the [simple Gospel message](https://icould.fail/gospel/). [The devil](https://icould.fail/demon-tricks/) plays with our fight against wrong thought, and we often veer too far in the opposite direction.
3. It's completely legal to be a Christian (even if its [political stance](https://icould.fail/wokism/) is up for debate), so there's no outside pressure borne of necessity to [change](https://gainedin.site/changes/).
4. [Intellectual properties](https://notageni.us/ip/) are often hyper-managed under archaic and borderline oppressive copyright law, even though there are many worlds of possibility under Creative Commons (and that's not even addressing the worlds of possibility [specific to _computer software_](https://techsplained.xyz/floss/))
5. Given all this, the social system propagates itself with much of the same. While the Body is _absurdly_ diverse (pulling from every tribe, nation, people, and tongue, if we believe [Revelation 7:9-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/rev.7)), most of the ideas that could radically allow Christians to love one another by using technology are generally met with unease.

This isn't a bashing of Christian churches, but more a blunt observation of a broad problem, and I mean it to highlight an issue I've devoted my ministry toward.

## The Issue

We need to provoke Christians to adopt today's technology.

For thousands of years, information transfer (and society in general) moved at a leisurely pace of 1-2 events/day. This is no longer true.

Now, if something happens in the MidEast on Monday, everyone's heard about it by Tuesday, and it becomes old news by Thursday, with a new event happening Friday. It means that the weekly Sunday church service is woefully outdated if it was targeting what happened at the beginning of the week, and making a twice-a-week service is barely keeping up.

If you go to any church website, they have the exact same framework:

- Information about where the church is located.
- Doctrinal statement about stuff that church believes.
- Local events happening at the church or, sometimes, in the community that the church is involved in.
- Archives of past sermons.

The [marketing](https://gainedin.site/marketing/) "call to action" is _always_ "go to our church", "go to our church event", or "privately contact a minister". This constrains that church to strictly geographical limits and invalidates the thousands of people who _could_ be positively influenced by the laity.

So, how do we fix this reality? I've been to "organic churches" that meet and mingle in places like bars and coffee shops, but with a central website and seasonal large-scale meeting together. While this isn't bad, it's a heavy cultural shift, and I don't believe we need to reinvent the wheel.

## The Solution

I propose a synthesis of old and new, in the same way that great architecture combines natural and synthetic, or how the arts draw together the past and imaginations of the future.

The entire purpose of the Church, according to the Bible, is God pulling together a network of believers, worshiping together. But, as long as we make the entire experience require being in-person, the Body is geographically constrained. Information travels faster than we can physically go and, as a formerly suicidal ASD, that information can literally save and transform lives by itself.

If you look at the conventional weekly-go-here-and-attend church setup, it's a combination of about the same elements:

1. Networking during the pre-church mingling and afterward: catching up on the week, making plans, praying for each other, even some discipleship and encouragement.
2. Publicly shared singing worship music to the Lord together, often made as a "sandwich" between the rest of the experiences.
3. (optional) Announcements of the other events going on throughout the week.
4. (optional) Honoring of at least _some_ of the sacraments, though mileage varies by denomination.
5. A reading of the Bible and/or [public speech](https://adequate.life/speaking/) from the pastor.
6. (optional) An altar call or "come to Jesus" moment with [the Gospel message](https://icould.fail/gospel/).

Now, let's parse the above and see how we can adapt technology to it:

1. Why does networking _have_ to be in-person? We can make a social media for people to create classified ads, dialogues on web forums, and video chats. Why do people have to go to TikTok or Reddit to find that?
2. Sharing in worship music with the Lord _can_ be powerful, so why not let the shut-ins and geographically distant to share with it in real-time?
3. Everything they're announcing can go online. Why does anyone have to show up at the church to get something that can be online?
4. We certainly don't want to dismiss the importance of breaking bread together. However, it doesn't have to necessarily be done strictly inside the church building as opposed to inside homes.
5. To put bluntly, not all pastors are equally inspired by God for every one of their sermons, and with the _vast_ array of well-read believers in nearly _every_ denomination (along with a vast variety of _highly_ capable laity), there's really no reason for a pastor to get near-burnout providing a weekly message, and the internet makes the pool of potential teachers for a good lesson near-endless.
6. Why are we limiting the Gospel message to simply the end of an emotionally charged message? Why can't it be online?

So, I propose a more online-enabled experience, and believe it must be built soon:

1. Have a church social network of their own, free from [outside influences](https://icould.fail/wokism/). Host it themselves (or with Christians they trust), and network it with other trustworthy churches that exist elsewhere on the planet.
2. Add interaction to online worship, through that social network. This may mean the chat-while-video-playing style you see on YouTube. But, again, to keep it safe from [persecution](https://icould.fail/persecution/), give exclusive technological control to the church leadership.
3. Make announcements public. If the leadership is concerned about who can see it, require that people must be logged in with an approved account to view/comment/whatever.
4. Use that social network to advertise sacraments. Why not have an asynchronous Eucharist, for those who work at that time, or a baptism that's on _very_ public record, or remove the distance factor for those who can't make it to mass?
5. Accumulate and share leaders that legitimately teach the Word, according to what the leadership believe to be right. Put them on social media, or make hyperlinks to them, whatever is correct for the situation.
6. Deliver the Gospel message _everywhere_ through our public online demonstration of our love for each other.

We need a decentralized social Church network to adapt with the times. Instead of redesigning a whole new way of doing church, I propose that we simply meet people where they're at. Let's simply add a technological element to the Church's existing experience that's interactive, safe, reliable, and easy to manage.
