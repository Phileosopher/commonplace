# The Big 5 persoanlity traits

The Big 5 personality indicator is the only [scientifically](science.md) proven personality test, though many other personality tests form approximately the same [classifications](logic.md). Each personality trait ends up cleanly dividing into two sub-factors for each dimension as well.

Many so-called "personality tests", however, are often representing our tendencies toward skills. This may be useful for [working](results.md) or [communication](people-conversation.md), but not for the way we [choose](people-decisions.md) to live our lives.

The range of 1-100 sits as a bell curve, where someone with a score of 1 is thousands of times more rare than someone with a score of 20. Usually, unique people are below 25 or above 75, and phenomenally different people are below 10 or above 90.

A person self-reporting on a Big 5 test is a reliable indicator across decades of how they'll likely [behave](results.md), but *other* people reporting on someone is also a reliable indicator as well.

The dimensions are easy to remember as an acronym, and it takes about 100 [well-asked questions](understanding.md) to find where someone sits on each spectrum.

- Openness to experience
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

## Openness to Experience

We are constantly forced to explore the [unknown](unknown.md) or intensify the [familiar](habits.md).

On the high end, we take enormous [social risks](socialrisk.md) and pioneer [trends](trends.md), mostly from the pursuit and love of [ideas](values.md). It provides the advantage of discovering new things, but at the risk of sabotaging healthy, long-standing [institutions](people-rules.md) of society. Most [intelligent](understanding.md) and [creative](mind-creativity.md) people tend to be high openness to experience, though not always.

On the low end, we establish [cultural traditions](people-culture.md) and [maintain order](understanding-certainty.md). It provides the advantage of maintaining good things and giving order, but at the risk of sabotaging healthy new things and shunning [risks](socialrisk.md).

One tiny statistical correlation shows that people born in warmer climates tend to be a little more willing to [take risks](socialrisk.md).

### Openness

We have a certain tolerance and enjoyment of exploring [unknown](unknown.md) [experiences](results.md):

- Enjoys [nature's](reality.md) [beauty](values-quality.md) and [believes](understanding-certainty.md) in [art's](mind-creativity.md) importance
- Becomes deeply immersed in [creative works](creations.md) like music and poetry
- Frequently reflects on experiences and thoughts and sees [beauty](values-quality.md) where others may not notice
- Needs a [creative outlet](creations.md)

In general, most people are *not* [creative](mind-creativity.md) in any given domain, and someone who's reasonably competent in a given creative domain represents less than 15% of the population. However, most people usually do at least *something* that's partly creative, typically for [fun](purpose.md).

### Intellect

We also have a certain tolerance and enjoyment of exploring [unknown](unknown.md) [ideas](values.md), which defines how well we can find [unique answers](results.md) to tasks:

- Thinks quickly and rapidly [understands](understanding.md) abstract [ideas](values.md) and [how things work](engineering.md)
- Can handle lots of [information](information.md) and has an extensive [vocabulary](language.md) that clearly indicates [ideas](values.md)
- Enjoys solving complex [problems](purpose.md)
- Enjoys [philosophical discussions](philosophy.md) and [difficult reading material](education.md)

Intellect can be *very* reliably measured with IQ tests that measure a person's ability to take a test about [understanding](understanding.md) and [logic](logic.md), but is a highly [controversial](conflicts-inner.md) subject because our biology mostly defines how smart we are, which demonstrates inherently that people have dramatically unequal [power](power.md) among each other.

Nobody knows how to increase IQ, though [education](education.md) can increase [understanding](understanding.md) of specific domains that won't transfer. However, malnourishment during [childhood](people-family.md) can definitely *decrease* IQ.

One aspect of intelligence that magnifies society's [inequality](jobs-specialization.md) comes through [technology](technology.md). Intelligent people naturally understand technology more, meaning they have more [power](power.md) proportionally to the power of that technology.

APPLICATION: Intelligent people who use computers are *insanely* quick compared to unintelligent people who don't use them. More technology creates more inequality, but its [morality](morality.md) comes strictly from how ethically those intelligent people [use that power](https://trendless.tech/trends/).

## Conscientiousness

We're constantly challenged to strive toward [what we ought](imagination.md) or honor our [present desires](mind-feelings.md). The disposition is defined by how much we create and abide by internal [rules](people-rules.md), and can also be defined as "grit".

On the high end, we [live virtuously](morality.md) by self-defined [rules](people-rules.md) and take those rules so seriously that we'll [lead](groups-small.md) ourselves and everyone else as a [moral](morality.md) imperative. It comes with the risks, however, of perfectionism (e.g., anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder).

On the low end, we follow [others' desires](groups-member.md) and [self-interest](purpose.md). It provides the advantage of us never feeling unfocused on the moment or adapting to [changes](people-changes.md), but at the risk of violating our [moral](morality.md) integrity and sacrificing long-term goals [worth striving for](meaning.md).

High conscientiousness provides the advantage of imparting high-quality [virtues](morality.md) and [habits](habits.md) into the rest of society, but at the risk of unnecessary conflict with any present leadership not following those [values](values.md) in turn, as well as risks of [over-management](mgmt-badsystems.md) and difficulty handling [changes](people-changes.md).

It's worth indicating that a conscientious disposition is *not* a [moral](morality.md) one. Many immoral actions can be performed from pre-existing [rules](people-rules.md) that are gradations of [evil](morality-evil.md).

### Industriousness

We have a certain natural desire to create [results](results.md) that make us value [duty](people-rules.md), diligence, and focus:

- Carry out our plans without wasting time or getting distracted
- Setting our minds to the immediate [task](purpose.md) and [finishing](results.md) what we start
- Making [decisions](people-decisions.md) quickly and [certain](understanding-certainty.md) about what we're doing

Often, we make things out of a sense of guilt or shame that our [value](values-quality.md) only comes in what we produce.

### Orderliness

We have a tendency to [feel](mind-feelings.md) disgust for the [risks](safety.md) of the [unknown](unknown.md), so we value [certainty](understanding-certainty.md) through honoring [details](understanding.md), [organization](organization.md), and [boundaries](people-boundaries.md):

- [Cleans up](home-housekeeping.md) belongings and keeps things organized
- Follows a schedule and enjoys [routine](habits.md)
- Bothered by [disorder](unknown.md) and messy people
- Wants every detail taken care of and that [rules](people-rules.md) are honored

## Extraversion (versus Introversion)

We either find renewal [with people](people-friends.mdds.md), or [without them](creations.md). This concept is easy enough to understand that practically *every* personality measurement without fail uses this dimension, but the disposition is linked more closely with how we [emotionally recharge](mind-feelings.md) than [social skills](people-conversation.md).

Extraversion dictates whether we devote more of our [tasks](purpose.md) toward people or things. Both of them have challenges, and require [practice](education.md) to get correct, so we'll see better [results](results.md) with the one that makes us more comfortable.

On the high end, we're constantly [choosing](people-decisions.md) to [interact with others](people-conversation.md). It provides the advantage of connecting with many people at once, but requires our constant involvement in a healthy group of people, and we're more susceptible to [lying](people-lying.md) to [gain favor from others](image-distortion.md).

Extroverts have a tendency to live impulsively in the present. While they end up enjoying life more (a necessary quality of the [good life](goodlife.md)), they also risk overlooking adverse long-term [adverse consequences](results.md).

On the low end, we prefer to be alone. It provides the advantage of working on [long-term projects](creations.md) and keeping our [rules](people-rules.md) unimpeded, but low skills at [influencing others](influence.md) mean others won't see the [results](results.md) of our efforts without someone else [advertising it](trends.md).

Introverts can often adapt to extroverted situations by more diligently [focusing](awareness.md) on what drains them and asserting themselves more often to *not* socially engage.

The amount people interrupt is a product of extraversion's two sub-dimensions. An introvert finds interruptions to be disrespectful (because they're not letting the speaker finish), while an extrovert finds *not* interrupting a sign of disrespect (because they're wasting the speaker's time).

### Enthusiasm

Enthusiastic people tend to find a certain amount of excitement and joy from [social interaction](people-conversation.md):

- Easy to [get to know](people-4_friends.md) and makes [friends](people-friends.mdds.md) easily
- Reveals more private information and is less likely to maintain distance with others
- Warms up quickly to others, has lots of fun, and laughs a lot
- Sees themselves as enthusiastic and explores their [feelings](mind-feelings.md) within themselves and with others

### Assertiveness

Conflicts themselves can be difficult, but assertive people often find a sense of [closure](understanding-certainty.md) out of practicing and enforcing our [boundaries](people-boundaries.md):

- [Sees themselves](identity.md) as a strong person and a good leader, and takes control in a [group](groups-small.md)
- Has plenty of experience and talent [influencing](influence.md) and [captivating](stories-storytellers.md) people
- The first to act: doesn't hold back [opinions](values.md) or wait for others to [lead](groups-small.md)

## Agreeableness (versus Disagreeableness)

In [conflicts](people-conflicts.md), we either wish to reconcile with others, or don't care what others think. This extends to how our [mental conflicts](conflicts-inner.md) operate as well. Agreeableness directly connects to how we resolve the conflict between our natural [compassion](mind-feelings.md) for babies and [predatory aggression](mind-feelings-fear.md).

On the high end, we [coexist well with others](people-friends.mdds.md). It provides the advantage of creating a harmonious society because we're inclined to like people, but with the downside of making [conflicts](people-5_conflicts.md) *very* complicated and other people taking advantage of the readiness to reconcile. It also has risks of us [lying](people-lying.md) to [please others](image-distortion.md).

On the low end, we disagree more readily. It provides the advantage of [enforcing boundaries](people-boundaries.md), but with the risk of intensifying conflicts among well-meaning people.

While disagreeable people typically know *exactly* what they [want](purpose.md), agreeable people often have no idea what they want because they're so busy paying attention to *others'* needs. Disagreeable people can often help agreeable people [understand](understanding.md) their latent [desires](purpose.md) through their more competitive nature.

### Compassion

We have a specific built-in capacity for [empathy](mind-feelings.md) when dealing with others, which is a psychological association to how we [care for infants](people-family.md):

- Feels others' [emotions](mind-feelings.md) and sympathizes with them
- Interested in others' [well-being](goodlife.md) and [problems](purpose.md)
- Enjoys investing time into others' lives

### Politeness

We have a preference toward a certain amount of [tactfulness](people-3_boundaries.md):

- Respects [authority](groups-large.md)
- Believes they're [equal](people-boundaries.md) with others
- Avoids imposing their will or taking advantage of others for personal gain
- Hate to insult people or put them under pressure
- Avoids [conflicts](people-conflicts.md) whenever possible

## Neuroticism (versus Emotional Stability)

We tend to interact with our environment with our [feelings](mind-feelings.md), which tend to react more toward negative experiences than positive ones.

On the high end, most of our experiences are emotional experiences that run through the right side of our brain. It provides the advantage of contending with [the unknown](unknown.md), but with the downside of feeling severely drained. Most people heavily integrated into [religious](religion.md) phenomenology have high neuroticism.

On the low end, most of our experiences are relatively [rational](logic.md) experiences that run through the left side of our brain. It provides the advantage of consistency and reproducibility, but with the downside of having little to no sympathy or compassion for others.

Counterintuitively, the best way to handle extreme emotional reactions is consistent, repeated exposure to new experiences. Eventually, enough experience will make *everything* somewhat [familiar](symbols.md). If there are any hangups in [motivation](purpose.md), reduce the ambition to something easily [attainable](results.md).

APPLICATION: Most miserable people are *actually* concerned about skills managing their neuroticism, but their social skill limits make them think it's about their extraversion.

### Withdrawal

We have a tendency to freeze when exposed to threats, which is a survival impulse of managing an [unknown risk](unknown.md). Withdrawal measures our self-consciousness, which determines how much we [wrestle](conflicts-inner.md) with the things that we're [afraid of](mind-feelings-fear.md):

- Easily feeling [threatened](safety.md) or [afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md)
- Feelings of depression and [discouragement](success-5_persevering.md)
- Easily embarrassed or overwhelmed

### Volatility

Events deliver a specific, measurable amount of emotional severity from how strongly the adverse [consequences](results.md) feel when we're first aware of them:

- Easily becomes angry, irritated, or upset
- Loses composure and stirred up easily
- Mood changes very frequently, and is very difficult to control

## In summary

Each personality is useful, in its place:

- Openness to experience - [Pioneer](socialrisk.md) vs. [Historian](stories-storytellers.md)
- Conscientiousness - [Rule-Maker](people-rules.md) vs. [Creative](mind-creativity.md)
- Extraversion - [Partying](fun-parties.md) vs. Books
- Agreeableness - [Negotiator](people-conflicts-negotiation.md) vs. [Interrogator](people-lying.md)
- Neuroticism - [Empath](mind-feelings.md)/[Spiritual](religion.md) vs. Unaffected

Generally, we can fix most of our personality defects with *other* personality characteristics to bridge the gap:

- Low openness to experience when managing high [social risk](socialrisk.md):
  - Conscientiousness can abide by known-working [standards](habits.md).
  - Extraversion can find how other people solve the problem.
  - Agreeableness can find a healthy [compromise](people-conflicts.md) for the problem.
- High openness to experience when facing a [tradition-based](people-culture.md) conflict:
  - Conscientiousness can honor the [leadership](groups-small.md), even without agreeing on the matter.
  - Extraversion can find new [people groups](groups-member.md) to explore more risks.
  - Agreeableness can find a way to accept others' [value systems](values.md).
  - Neuroticism can find a [creative](mind-creativity.md) convergence between the old and new.
- Low conscientiousness when required to perform [tasks](results.md):
  - Openness to experience can find new permutations of an otherwise boring task.
  - Extraversion can find other people to help out in exchange for favors.
  - Agreeableness can [imagine](imagination.md) adverse social consequences for not performing the task.
- High conscientiousness when associating with messy people:
  - Openness to experience can find other people to associate with.
  - Extraversion can find [meaning](meaning.md) in the [friendship](people-friends.mdds.md) through [love](people-love.md) even while experiencing disgust.
  - Agreeableness can learn to accept others' way of life.
- Low extraversion when required to associate with other people:
  - Openness to experience can research new information about [how to have social skills](people-3_boundaries.md).
  - Conscientiousness can focus on [tasks](results.md) while around others.
  - Agreeableness can learn how to [listen more](people-3_boundaries.md) and find interesting qualities in others.
  - Neuroticism can learn to open up more transparently about their [feelings](mind-feelings.md) with strangers.
- High extraversion when required to perform mundane [tasks](results.md):
  - Openness to experience can find new ways to [imagine](imagination.md) and anthropomorphize those tasks.
  - Conscientiousness can interpret the task as a necessary duty and push through it.
  - Agreeableness can find a way to [negotiate](people-conflicts-negotiation.md) a mutually better arrangement.
- Low agreeableness when required to get along with others:
  - Conscientiousness can interpret it as a necessary means of maintaining [order](understanding-certainty.md).
  - Extraversion can find [meaning](meaning.md) in the social benefits of coexistence.
  - Neuroticism can learn to express vulnerability with others about their [fears](mind-feelings-fear.md) and concerns.
- High agreeableness when required to confront others:
  - Conscientiousness can perform it on a basis of [ethics](morality.md) or [risk management](safety-riskmgmt.md).
  - Extraversion can find some level of enjoyment in the social interaction, even when it'll end poorly.
  - Neuroticism can devote their [emotional](mind-feelings.md) energy when angry or frustrated toward the ugly task.
- Low neuroticism in an emotionally volatile situation:
  - Conscientiousness can regard itself as a foundation of stability and peace in a potential conflict.
  - Agreeableness can find [friendship](people-friends.mdds.md) with people by connecting personally with others.
- High neuroticism in a steady-and-slow situation:
  - Conscientiousness can learn to [discipline](habits.md) themselves to a more even approach.
  - Extraversion can connect more closely with the other people in the situation.
  - Agreeableness can find closure through others' experiences.

Frequently, even if *you* can't do something, others can. This takes tremendous humility, but you're *far* more naturally equipped to resolve certain problems better than others, and the same goes for everyone else.

To make a healthy and diverse group, *all* the personalities must be represented, which is easiest by drawing from a wide variety of families from vastly different ethnic backgrounds. This never plays out as well in practice for [industry-specific domains](jobs-specialization.md) (due to specific demands of various trades), represents the most within casual social [clubs](groups-small.md) and organized [religion](religion.md), and is a massive reason why a nation of immigrants (e.g., USA when people want to move there) has natural [creative](mind-creativity.md) and [competitive](socialrisk.md) advantages.
