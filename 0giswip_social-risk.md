We constantly make social risks to gain what we've [purposed](/purpose/).

We tend to make [calculated decisions](/decisions/) and assessment about what we [create](/creations/) by how it applies to others:

- Whether we want something
- Whether we'd want it if they wanted it
- How [likely](/certainty/) they may want it
- How much we're willing to sacrifice, in light of all the above

We end up either trusting that we'll yield [meaningful](/meaning/) [results](/results/), or we don't bother starting it.

Unfortunately, people often don't have the same [values](/values/) or [purposes](/purpose/) as us. This can be the source of many [conflicts](/boundaries/) and can discourage us from future endeavors.

Every time we [create](/creations/) things that may affect others, we risk our [expectations](/imagination/) of their opinion about it to be incorrect. Even when the risk is low, it's never precisely [certain](/certainty/) what other people are thinking. It becomes more uncertain as it applies to how they see us, which becomes our [reputation](/image/) over time.

Since we don't have the time to do *everything* we'd like to do, we prioritize what we want, with our [decisions](/decisions/) calculating between what we like and the chances other people will like it.

## Deviants

Even when they hate it, most people simply choose what they think other people would like because it gains the most [power](/power/) for *other*, more [meaningful](/meaning/) [purposes](/purpose/).

Some people, though, consider their situation closely. They start asking what they'd like to do instead of merely what they think other people would like. As a general rule, they find every possible way to play and [have fun](https://adequate.life/having-fun/), even at serious or boring tasks.

These people will then make sacrifices toward finding an interest that fulfills multiple criteria at once:

1. They like it enough that they can [obsess about it](/addiction/) for at least a few years.
2. Other people like it, but it's not fulfilled by existing [solutions](/results/).
3. Other people are willing to give [power](/power/) to them for it, especially in the [form](/power-types/) of money.

## Idea

To meet all these criteria at once usually requires focused [creativity](/creativity/). People meet most of their typical, common [desires](/purpose/) through [large groups](/groups-large/) that can do things [more efficiently](/specialization-cities/), so that creative solution usually has several constraints:

1. It needs a [small group](/groups-small/), even if it's simply a nucleus group in the middle of the larger group.
2. It typically uses [technology](/technology/) that wasn't there when the [trend](/trends/) of the largely satisfied need had started.
3. The creation fulfills a [desire](/purpose/) that people aren't even [aware](/understanding/) they have yet.

Many times, the idea will come from exploring a [taboo](/taboos/) or a recent [social trend](/trends/), especially a brand-new one. It almost *always* comes from seeing something that everyone [overlooked](https://adequate.life/awareness/), and often exists within [nature](/reality/).

One *severe* requirement of these people succeeding is that they have a high [conscientiousness](/personality/). They don't necessarily have to be *[moral](/morality/)*, but they must have an incessant aspiration toward specific [values](/values/) to maintain their [faith](/trust/) that they can succeed against the inevitable [conflicts](/boundaries/) from the surrounding [culture](/culture/).

The role will fill a *very* specific need, so [creative](/creativity/) [risks](/safety/) require engaging with many complete strangers. If it's a commonplace thing (e.g., toilet paper) it requires lots of volume, but if it fulfills a niche (e.g., phone cases) most people won't want it so it will require more [searching and advertisement](https://notageni.us/marketing/).

The engagement with complete strangers will test the creator's general [trust in humanity](/trust/). If that person can't trust people in general, other people won't be as inclined to trust back, since people tend to give [equivalent](/justice/) treatment. But, most people are willing to accept their [uncertainty](/certainty/) about others *may* lead to good things.

## Obsessed

Finding and exploring a specific [purpose](/purpose/) can be challenging, so most people searching for an elusive need will obsess with fulfilling it. It may be driven by [love](/love/), [virtue](/morality/), or [vice](/addiction/) but will *always* lead to them caring much more about their work than their peers, often to the point of a single-minded and near-[religious](/religion/) fanaticism.

Ordinarily, a creator will be competing with large-scale organizations. To simply fight it, they'll obsess with [trimming inefficiencies](/results/), [learning](/understanding/) constantly from other risk-takers, doing things that a large system *can't* do, and seeking new [technologies](/technology/) that could magnify their labor.

People often attribute this entire experience to [entrepreneurship](https://notageni.us/entrepreneur/), but it encompasses *many* realms that require [marketing](http://notageni.us/marketing/) with strangers:

- [Job-seeking](https://adequate.life/jobs-1/)
- [Investing](https://notageni.us/investing/) and venture capitalists
- Professional artists like [writing](https://adequate.life/writing/), music, and visual arts
- Performance arts, including [public speaking](https://adequate.life/speaking/) and acting
- Inventing things
- Colonizing unoccupied territory (though it's not as common anymore now that the planet has been largely settled)
- [Scientists](/science/) pursuing [unpopular](/trends/) ideas
- Running a church or not-for-profit organization (i.e., it's a for-profit organization where the [accounting](https://notageni.us/accounting/) separates profit from expenses)
- Government organizations which will lose [power](/power/) if they fail or face [competition](/war/) from the private sector or other nations
- Making a government coup or declaring [war](/war/)

While they're usually fulfilling a very specific [specialization](/specialization-cities/) that's a niche of a niche, they don't typically start that way. Instead, they're doing dozens of tiny tasks across a broader range of disciplines, since nobody else has specialized in that way yet, and they're typically running a tiny operation. As their organization [grows](/groups-small/), they can hand off work, but not at first.

To accomplish this, most of the risk-takers have a near-opposite [attitude](/purpose/) about [reality](/reality/) compared to the rest of the members in that group:

- While most people [fear](/fear/) [risk](/safety/), they see [opportunities](/purpose/) in it.
- Most people are working as part of a [group](/groups-large/) toward that group's predefined [goal](/purpose/), but they're constantly [deciding](/decisions/) to shift their [purposes](/purpose/) around.
- While most people are in the early or late majority on most [trends](/trends/), they're often innovators or early adopters.
- Most people have great ideas, but don't want to make the sacrifices for them.
- Risk-takers regularly have an intense [understanding](/understanding/) of [reality](/reality/) and at least some awareness of [what they want](/purpose/).

## Success

Their efforts will generally not succeed, simply because they're trying things that have tremendous risks, and frequently in competition with [large-scale systems](/bad-systems/) that don't want them to prevail.

However, these risks, when successful, add new [value](/purpose/) to people in ways nobody could have anticipated. The risk-taker is regularly honored as the founder of a [trend](/trends/), even when they simply worked hard and [remixed others' works](/creativity/).

Frequently, success in taking social risks requires finding value that wasn't previously regarded as value, which requires a unique perspective that explores [creative](/creativity/) and otherwise-[taboo](/taboo/) perspectives:

- A city's [gang problem](/bad-systems/) means many [young people](/maturity/) are finding [meaning](/meaning/) through honoring a semi-formalized ad-hoc social structure.
- A high murder rate means people have severe, unspoken [feelings](/feelings/) that can be redirected toward a more [useful](/purpose/) goal.
- Destruction of the environment means many people have likely been productive [creating](/creations/) other things.
- A fading [culture](/culture/) or [trend](/trends/) means people have adopted a *different* culture or trend instead.

As you can see, this is a *massive* vote of [confidence](/trust/) in the [unknown](/unknown/).

The [social class](/classes/) of the risk-taker will often lean upward, but this isn't strictly the case. Their trajectory all depends on what they're trying to accomplish. However, [money](/economics/) and [influence](/influence/) will follow them because others who believe in them will *[choose](/decisions/)* to give them [power](/power/) to keep them going.

This success won't be without opposition. Every new trend means the death of an old one, and the [groups losing power](/bad-systems/) will try to shut it down to maintain their way of life. For this reason, most of the individuals who make the risks against established convention will *not* succeed.

However, the new way of life advanced by the social risk will have advantages. Eventually, assuming there aren't any [government efforts to halt it](/rule-methods/), enough of a majority will follow in the risk-taking through the desire to have a more convenient life, and the [trend](/trends/) will win against the old way.

However, the [establishment](/groups-large/) is always fighting a losing battle of attrition with all those risk-takers. They may be able to postpone or destroy smaller groups that start the new trend, at least for a long time:

- For hundreds of years, the Catholic Church didn't want the Bible published, so they held back the development of the printing press, all the way up to the Protestant Reformation.
- Thomas Edison used electrical direct current (DC) for his [creations](/creations/). When alternating current (AC) came out as safer and farther-traveling electricity, he used public demonstrations of killing various animals to imply AC was deadlier.
- Big Ice didn't want the refrigerator to become a trend. They introduced [marketing campaigns](https://notageni.us/marketing/) that implied parents could lock their children inside and kill them.
- The Wright brothers invented flight, but then sat on their invention and failed to distribute the idea freely until their [intellectual property rights](https://notageni.us/ip/) expired.

It never works indefinitely, though. It only persists as long as the public remains [unaware](/understanding/) of how the new trend's benefits outweigh its risks. Both sides (innovator and old group) will make huge [political shows](/image-distortion/) of [their side](/storytellers/) of the situation.

If the venture can weather it, it becomes another [large group](/groups-large/) after enough time, ready for another [trend](/trends/) to arise and the role to replay itself.

## Failure

Risks naturally come with chances of failure. In the case of a new effort, there are *many* failures for every success.

There are two major sources of failure:

- [Cultural](/culture/) opposition from the risk-taker's violation of existing [standards](/habits/), which is why the [geeks and heretics](/trends/) never reap much from their efforts.
- Competition from other people doing the same things, which is why the majority never reap those rewards.

For this reason, people who walk the fine line of honoring taboo but also breaking convention can ever win. However, since this is based on [feelings](/feelings/), it can change at an *instant* with a small shift in [narrative](/stories/), and much of it is bound up in [luck](/unknown/).

Unfortunately, [history](/storytellers/) tends to forget that aspect. We see the end of the [story](/stories/) as we [consume it](/creations/), so we can often overlook how it [felt](/feelings/) in the middle of it, as well as the *many* stories of failed attempts for every [success story](https://adequate.life/success-1/).

A person can lose tremendous [power](/power/) in a giant risk, as well as their willingness to try [new things](/image/), so most raw risk-takers are [younger people](/maturity/) in their 20s and 30s. When people get older, they frequently have too much to lose for it to be [worthwhile](/purpose/) for them.

Further, even a tremendously successful risk-taker can become *very* [risk-averse](/safety/) as they [age](/maturity/). It may be because they've gained enough [power](/power/) they have something to lose, or that they're fatigued from all the existing loss they've already incurred.

## Incubating

It's in [large groups'](/groups-large/) best interests (e.g., governments, massive corporations) to foster risk-takers. Besides cutting down on competition (since they're profiting directly from it and gaining [favor](/friendship/)) they can often build and [frame](/image/) the new [trends](/trends/) themselves instead of fighting them later.

Unfortunately, no reliable system can "make" risk-takers. Risk-taking is an [attitude](/purpose/) more than [understanding](/understanding/), so the creators are experiencing a highly personal [journey](/stories/) of self-discovery as they [influence](/influence/) their environment.

What a large group *can* do, though, is permit those ideas to incubate. By letting that person loosely associate with other people who share their [passion](/feelings/), they're more likely to ally with [groups](/groups-small/) that are part of a larger unit.

Time is a risk-taker's most significant resource. By giving them the time to [learn](/pedagogy/), explore, tinker, and gain [understanding](/understanding/), that person can branch out on their own when they're ready.

## Application

Most people *can't* be entrepreneurs because they're not willing to make the sacrifices to [friendships](/friendship/) and other [purposes](/purpose/) to achieve it.

Since every system eventually turns [bad](/bad-systems/) from [human nature](/humanity/), there'll always be people breaking free from [a group's leadership](/groups-large/) somewhere to start something new.

Pay close attention to the heretics, since the [new trends](/trends/) will come from them if enough people share their [belief](/certainty/).

Any place whatsoever that gives many people lots of time, the means to survive, and unfulfilled needs will draw out the [creative](/creativity/) spark that can build into something profound. Ironically, the best place to give someone lots of time is within a [bad system](/bad-systems/), which often gives [trade secrets](/power-types/) away as well in the process.

Since every success story has *many* failure stories attached elsewhere to it, pay close attention to unlikely circumstances that they were entrenched in. Imitating them won't get you to their status, but [trusting](/certainty/) in the same kind of [luck](/unknown/) they played certainly will.

If you're going to take a risk, keep your head down and stay as undetected as you can for as long as possible. Once you start making [ripples across society](/trends/), expect the [big and established systems](/bad-systems/) to come after you with [everything they have](/rules/).

Social risk requires a [culture](/culture/) that fosters it, which is why certain countries (e.g., the USA) have *way* more [entrepreneurs](https://notageni.us/entrepreneur/) than most of the rest, irrespective of the country's [actual economy](/economics/).

What got you *to* overwhelming success won't take you farther into running ever-larger applications of [power](/power/). Unfortunately, this also means [leadership skills](/groups-small/) (which consider others' [fears](/fear/)) sabotage the drive to perform high-risk tasks over time.

Social risk requires scarcity. When people don't have a shortage, they don't maximize their efforts to go as far as possible with the limited amount of something they have.
