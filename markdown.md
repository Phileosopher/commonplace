# Markdown tricks

The simplest way to depict rich text is via Markdown format.

- Any further reductionism from Markdown text creates plaintext files.

Most markdown files are saved as ".md" extension, but the syntax is often enabled by default within many web-based text editors.

# Heading 1

Heading 1
=========

## Heading 2

Heading 2
---------

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Formatting

*italic*

_italic_

**bold**

__bold__

Note: avoid underscores in the middle of a word

~~strikethrough~~

> block quote

[hyperlink](www.hyperlink.com) → an HTML hyperlink

![alt text](www.hyperlink.com "title") → an HTML img with title and alt text

## Other elements

* list item A * list item B * list item C becomes:

- list item A
- list item B
- list item C

(lists can also be numbered with 1. list item A 2. list item B etc.)

'code block' becomes:

```(language)
code block
```

NOTE: code blocks are only useful for [writing](language-writing.md) if you're tech-savvy or when you want someone to copy-paste the content.

If you ever want to have the software ignore markdown on a given line, use the \ character.
