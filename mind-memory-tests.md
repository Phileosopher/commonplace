# Test deduction tricks

Logically eliminate the answers to multiple-choice questions:

- You can usually remove absurd answers, which will also often remove "all of the above" answers as well.
- If two answers can't logically *both* be the answer, then "all of the above" is the wrong answer.
- All-inclusive adverbs (always, never, must, only, merely) are less frequently the right answer, since most things in life aren't all-inclusive.
- Consider the lengths of the correct answers on the rest of the test:
  - If the correct answer is usually longer, choose the longer answer.
  - If the correct answer is usually shorter, choose the shorter answer.
- If there are different number values, the correct answer is likely one of the ones in the middle.
- When two answers have opposite meanings, the correct answer is likely one of those two.
- If the grammar of one of the choices doesn't match the question, that answer is usually wrong.
- If there are similar words in both the question and the answer, the answer is usually correct.
- Consider the singular/plural tense of the question:
  - If the form of the question or statement uses "is", the answer is usually singular.
  - If the form of the question or statement uses "are", the answer is usually plural.
- If you can, ask the instructor for clarification on a test question.
  - You can usually infer some details based on how they answer that question.
- On a 4-choice answer, if you can't deduce it any further, choose the third option.
- If you have an incredibly intelligent teacher who has a low pass rate, then do the reverse of most of these.

You can usually feel your way through an essay question you don't know:

- Write out ideas in the margins so you won't forget them.
- Drop in as many terms and jargon as you can remember.
- Thoroughly write out as much as you can, since the reviewer is likely looking for a list of details.
- If you *do* understand other essay questions on the same test, make sure you use the same jargon and terms from what you remember elsewhere.

You also have some extra holistic tricks if you know who is grading the test:

- Write about the general topics on the teacher's lectures, *not* the topics of the book.
- Write in conformity to their [political opinions](politics-systems.md), even when it may not seem to apply (e.g., address climate change if they're [leftist](politics-leftism.md), endorse the free market if they're [conservative](politics-conservativeliberal.md)).
