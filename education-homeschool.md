# How to homeschool

Homeschooling is taking on personal [responsibility](meaning.md) for your [children's](parenting-children.md) [education](education.md).

- The quality of a formalized education is defined by the educational quality of the teacher, divided by the class size (since they can only devote attention proportionally to your child).
- Across the lens of history, *not* educating your elementary-age child and trusting the government to do it is a relatively new [fashion](trends.md), and has profound [political consequences](politics-conservativeliberal.md).

The quality of a homeschool child's education comes directly from a few sources:

1. The quality of you as a person and [educator](education.md).
2. The proportional attention you must give to *each* of the children you're teaching.
3. How well you supplement their experience in places you have shortcomings.

Homeschooling your child is effectively a part-time job.

- If you're a homemaker in a double-income household, you can easily splice the work with your other responsibilities.
- [Raising children in general](parenting-children.md) requires a full-time caretaker, which means that same caretaker can also typically [educate](education.md) a small child alongside their work.

Homeschooling children is *not* necessarily better or worse.

- Bad parenting would make a child less well-adjusted than if they went to a public school, even if they were more educated about certain domains.
- In non-nuclear homes (e.g., single parenting), it's often simply not possible to homeschool and would require someone else to educate them.
- Despite any political moves to the contrary, most of the criticism about homeschooling is on the level with [any other advice on parenting](parenting-children.md).

If you [thoroughly understand](understanding.md) what you learned in high school, are a [decent-enough parent](parenting-children.md), and sufficiently committed to raising them [with someone else](relationships-marriage.md), educating your child isn't difficult.

- Public school education systems often use [dark patterns](engineering-design.md) to imply elementary education is far more complicated than you're [specialized](jobs-specialization.md) to perform.

Government-provided education is a substantial *quantity* of time, so aim for *quality* if you're homeschooling.

- If you're focused, you don't need much time each day:
  - Preschool - 0--30 minutes
  - Lower Elementary - 1 hour
  - Upper Elementary - 2 hours
  - Middle School - 2-3 hours
  - High School - 2-4 hours
- Focus heavily on what they want, and only focus on the bare minimum for what they hate.
- Generally, if they keep developing their intellectual strengths, they'll come back around to positively influencing their weaknesses:
  - An analytical child who hates history but loves math may find value in dates' chronological sequence.
  - Artistic children tend to love reading sensational stories more than history, so they may enjoy history once they see dramatizations of it.
- Since they simply need to [understand](understanding.md) the information or methods directly, don't worry about completing a specific curriculum if another teaching method works better for how they're [learning](education.md).

There's really no homeschool "culture".

- Homeschooling culture in the USA is approximately 1/4 each of Christian, agnostic, Jewish, and Muslim, with smatterings of Hindu.
- *Some* Christian homeschool culture can be self-isolating, which creates most of the false stereotypes around its [indoctrination](power-influence.md) and antisocial tendencies.
- In general, abusive parents (which are a tiny minority of parents) are more likely to use homeschooling to justify further abuse, which gives *all* homeschool families a bad name when [media stories](stories-storytellers.md) draw attention to those specific situations.

One consistent aspect of a homeschooled child is *extreme* failure or success later in life.

- They receive specialized and focused support from their parents.
- The variety of children they're exposed to can give them a more diverse range of viewpoints.
- When they're in key developmental years, they can [sleep](sleep.md) for longer if they need and the [food](cooking.md) is better.
- However, a lazy child has even *more* means to slack off than a formalized school system.

## Prerequisites

A. The child *must* agree to homeschooling and promise to be serious about it.

- Children often hate their private/public school:
  - They may not be learning fast enough at the school.
  - Their teachers might be bad.
  - They might be a victim of [bullying](power-types.md).
  - They simply might hate the school itself, the course work, etc.
- If they love their school and everything about it,
- On the other hand, if a child doesn't take their education seriously at all *while* they're homeschooled, their parents won't be their best educators, no matter the reason.
- However, if both the parents and children are willing, homeschooling is straightforward.

B. Homeschooled children do *not* need as much time learning as formalized education.

- Generally, 30 minutes of hard, formalized education a day (preferably in the morning) is enough to cover the basic educational requirements for their current grade, with the rest of the day as reinforcement of the idea.
- Children [learn](understanding.md) at different rates, and homeschool allows a tailored experience relative to each child's [personality](personality.md).
- Give them freedom to explore and play on their own, *without* structure.

C. Don't over-test or over-drill them.

- [Understanding](understanding.md) transitions through gradations, and needs some cooling-off to prevent burnout.
  - Sometimes, it may work best to work on one subject a day or week, instead of a little of each subject every day.
- We don't measure *adults* who [specialize](jobs-specialization.md) in one role by their weakest roles, so we shouldn't do that to our children.

D. Every good homeschool parent *must* be humble.

- You're *not* qualified to teach them everything about life, and alongside [your spouse](relationships-marriage.md), you'll still miss some parts.
  - You will absolutely *need* to find [specialists](jobs-specialization.md) in the areas you don't understand as well, typically through your community or homeschool groups.
- You will *not* be able to shelter your children, even if you homeschool them.
  - Parents who obsess about protecting their children's innocence tend to raise bad kids who are good at concealing bad behavior.
  - Teaching the value of [morality](morality.md) is *far* more important than protecting them.
- You have more flexibility to adapt to their needs than any formalized educational system could give them.
  - If they need more time on a subject, you can focus exclusively on that one than the rest.
  - When they're extremely talented at a subject, you can equip them with advanced projects in that domain.
- Eventually, once they reach high school, you will need to give *much* more of their specialized learning to others unless they want to carry on your family practice.

E. Your geographical region has a profound influence on how your government sees homeschooling.

- When you live in a population-dense area, many government precincts require children to attend a government-approved school.
  - Generally, governments prefer to school children themselves for [financial](economics.md) reasons, and any [indoctrination](power-influence.md) reasons are simply a bonus for them.
- The challenges you're *far* more likely to face will come through the [bureaucracy](bureaucracy.md) from [government requirements](legal-safety.md) more than the education itself.

F. Find a healthy homeschool community that can plug you into homeschooling resources at large.

- No matter how resourceful or intelligent you are, the community has *way* more support than you can give to your child alone.
- Many homeschool networks are so powerful that they can lobby for *[political action](legal-doctrines.md)* to keep homeschooling legal (e.g., [HSLDA](https://hslda.org/)).

## Teaching Styles

Most of the homeschool methods are variations on two possible themes:

1. Give them as many high-quality approaches to learning as their minds are capable of handling, then make sure they sufficiently understand it.
2. Provide them as much freedom as possible to learn and develop on their own, with some amount of input to guide them along their journey.

One of the most important discussions revolves around "deschooling" by removing the formalized structures that imply a school/life dichotomy.

- Check out homeschool conventions, message boards, and online discussions before committing to any particular curriculum.

There are many homeschool books, curricula, styles, opinions, and philosophies, more than you'll *ever* need.

You can typically adapt your routines *beyond* your children to accommodate their education:

- [Cooking](cooking.md) is an excellent time to teach counting and writing (by naming foods).
- If you [grow plants](horticulture.md), they can learn chemistry (through the soil).
- If you have [pets](fun-pets.md) or [raise livestock](agriculture.md), they can learn biology at the same time.
- [Auto repair](autos.md) is a great time to teach shapes and geometry.
- If you're willing to [get creative](mind-creativity.md), *every* mundane task can become an educational experience for your child.
- While it's *highly* chaotic, almost all play time with siblings can be directed to educational ends as well.

**School-At-Home** (aka **traditional**) homeschooling is the "stereotypical" homeschooling approach most parents use when they don't know any better:

- Use a boxed curriculum with textbooks, study schedules, grades, and record-keeping like a standardized classroom.
- This takes a *lot* of (potentially unnecessary) work and has the highest burnout rate.
- However, this means they know *exactly* what to teach and when.
- School-at-home is literally the *worst* way to homeschool because it's the burden of a standardized classroom on the parent, minus the benefits of socially interacting with their peers.
- One advantage is that the extra direct involvement with the student will mean education can be 4 hours a day instead of the typical 5--7 hours of a classroom.

**Classical** homeschool teaches children to learn for themselves:

- The Classical model has been around since the Middle Ages, and possibly longer.
  - **Traditional** homeschool was derived *from* Classical, and a classroom setting typically uses a watered-down version of it.
- There are 5 tools of learning called the Trivium: Reason, Record, Research, Relate, and Rhetoric.
- It transitions through several stages:
  1. Younger children begin with math and literacy.
  2. Then, there's an emphasis on grammar
  3. Then, move to a dialectic stage with reading, study, and research.
  4. Finally, the rhetoric stage emphasizes [communication](people-conversation.md).
- The curriculum is *highly* structured, with every hour accounted-for.
  - This requires a *lot* of rigor on both parents and children (and therefore risks of burnout), and requires educators who know how to communicate clearly.
  - For this reason, most Classical homeschooling is performed with groups of people who can [specialize](jobs-specialization.md) in the different domains.
- The method tends to create "History Notebooks", which can be popular with **eclectic** styles. The most popular on the Classical approach is [The Well-Trained Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Well-Trained-Mind-Classical-Education-Fourth/dp/0393253627).

**Charlotte Mason** homeschooling (est. ~1892) emphasizes time to play, create, and be involved in real-life situations:

- The style was created by the British educator Charlotte Mason within a series of lectures that blossomed within the next few decades into a full curriculum.
  - It deviates from the **Classical** approach by incorporating more time outdoors, with students encouraged to keep a nature journal.
- The style opposes "tabula rasa" (that children are blank containers waiting to be filled with information) but are persons who deserve respect in their own right. Charlotte Mason believed in the motto "I am, I can, I ought, I will":
  - I am a person of great value.
  - I can do everything required of me.
  - I ought to serve others.
  - I will [choose](people-decisions.md) to do [what's right](morality.md), even when I don't want to.
- It delays formal instruction until age 6 when children are developmentally ready.
- Children will explore "living books" by taking nature walks to learn biology, visiting art museums to understand the arts, and learn aspects of geography, history, and literature similarly.
- Instead of formalized testing, children are drilled on the subject via narration and discussion.
- The style is much more social than other approaches and has various support groups and sites online.

**Montessori method** (est. 1897) involves adapting children's interests and activities instead of formal teaching methods:

- Maria Montessori began the idea from learning [educational theory](education.md) at the University of Rome, with 2 presumptions:
  1. Psychological [self-construction](values.md) in both adults and children happens through interacting with [our environment](reality.md).
  2. Children (especially under age 6) have an innate, predetermined path for their psychological development.
- While many things use the Montessori name (since it's not [trademarked](legal-ip.md)), the [Association Montessori Internationale](https://montessori-ami.org/) and [American Montessori Society](https://amshq.org/) have a few required elements:
  - Mixed-age classrooms (e.g., 0-3, 6-9, 9-12, 12-15, 15-18), with 30-36 month to 6-year-old being most common.
  - The student chooses their activity from a prescribed list of options.
  - Uninterrupted blocks of work time, ideally 3 hours long.
  - Where students learn by working with concepts more than direct instruction (constructivist/discovery model).
  - Specialized educational materials are made from natural materials (e.g., wood) instead of plastic.
  - Materials are organized intentionally by subject area, are accessible to children, and scaled downward to their size.
  - A trained teacher is experienced at observing a child's characteristics, tendencies, innate talents, and abilities.

**Waldorf** (aka **Steiner education**, est. 1919) homeschooling believes in educating the whole child with the frequent mantra "head, heart, and hands":

- Waldorf's style was founded through a German school from Rudolf Steiner's spiritualized [philosophy](philosophy.md) of [anthroposophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy) with the frequent mantra "head, heart and hands".
  - Head means [thinking](understanding.md) clearly and independently.
  - Heart means the student having [emotional connection](mind-feelings.md) with their work and the world at large.
  - Hands means the willingness to take action to [achieve goals](results.md) and [contribute to the world](meaning.md).
- In practice, it's like Charlotte Mason, but has a far more secular approach with more holistic elements.
- In the early stage, there's an emphasis on [arts and crafts](mind-creativity.md), music, and movement, and nature.
- Waldorf style believes in rigorous academics, but *only* after the child is developmentally ready. Formal academics, especially reading, is delayed until age 7.
- Older children are taught to develop [self-awareness](awareness.md) and [reason](logic.md) things out for themselves.
- One key detail is that it's *very* anti-[technology](technology.md).

**Multiple Intelligences** (est. 1983) homeschooling derives off the belief that every person has a form of [intelligence](understanding.md) that sits on multiple spectra:

- The theory is based on Howard Gardner's Harvard essay and book [Frames of Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Frames-Mind-Theory-Multiple-Intelligences/dp/0465024335):
  1. [Visual](image.md) and space (visual-spatial)
  2. [Language](language.md) and words (linguistic-verbal)
  3. [Logic](logic.md) and [mathematics](math.md) (logical-mathematical)
  4. [Body movement](fun-sports.md) (body-kinesthetic)
  5. Musical
  6. [Connection with others](people-conversation.md) (interpersonal)
  7. [Awareness](awareness.md) of oneself (intrapersonal)
  8. Ability to explore [the environment](reality.md) (naturalistic, more contentious than the original 7).
  9. Theoretically, other forms that haven't been discovered yet.
- The idea is that everyone is *somehow* intelligent along these spectra, and that children must be taught with methods that match those particular intelligences.
- The method is new enough that there are not many curricula oriented toward it, so it sits more as a "philosophy" to adapt a child's learning than a proper homeschool "method".

**Unit study** (aka **thematic studies**, **integrated approach**) homeschool focuses on one central theme, then combines multiple subjects into one study:

- Every topic is the starting-point for a multidisciplinary exploration, with no pressure for the children to move on.
- It is straightforward to implement with the internet and free tutorials about pretty much anything.

**Unschooling** (aka **natural**, **interest-led** learning, **child-led** learning) uses everyday life experiences without formalized lessons or schedules:

- This comes from believing that [learning](education.md) happens naturally and effortlessly, which requires parents [trusting](understanding-certainty.md) their children.
- Sometimes, critics call it "home-squirreling" from the wayward framing of the conversations.
- Generally, the parents ask the *children* what they are eager to learn that day.
- The children will know how to research and become [experts](jobs-specialization.md) in their areas of interest, but the risk is they may do poorly on grade level assessments, and *will* have a difficult time in a formalized school system later if they pursue it.

**Relaxed/Eclectic** homeschooling tends to have a casual approach:

- Gather various workbooks and content for math and literacy, and take an **unschooling** approach for less formalized subjects (e.g., history).
- Mornings are typically mandatory schoolwork, while afternoons are for hobbies and special projects.
- One *major* advantage of this style is that you can teach them about important details they may need to understand, such as [how to live well](goodlife.md) and [basic life skills](habits.md).

If you know people and are [entrepreneur minded](entrepreneur-1_why.md), you can also start a **schoolhouse** yourself:

1. Find at least 10--15 children who need educating and a *very* intelligent teacher in your community willing to sacrifice their time to educate.
2. Establish a schoolhouse with those children, using a more streamlined version of a homeschool method.
3. As the children grow and the schoolhouse becomes [popular](trends.md), start *separate* schoolhouses headed by other teachers.

## Requirements

Every state and precinct has unique requirements, which [you should be informed of](legal-safety.md).

- Each state has its own legal framework that allows homeschooling.
- If you move to another state, don't presume the prior state's rules apply.
- Research *precisely* by grade what you must teach your children.
- Keep records of the work your children perform, as well as any tests you've given them and how well they've done.
- Preferably, document the experience right after it happened, since you may not remember 4--6 months ago.
- Stay connected with a homeschool community, who will keep you informed about any changes to reporting requirements and standards.
- With the freedoms you'll likely give your children, keep an eye out for "Reasonable Childhood Independence" laws and where your state stands.
  - In places that don't have those laws, a terrified person calling the police could send you into a legal battle because you sent your 7-year-old a quarter-mile down the road to get some groceries.

Some states require tests and others don't regulate it at all.

- If you're doing a good-enough job, the children will be fine: the requirements are minimums for when a child sits neglected in a boring room for 5--6 hours a day.
- The larger risk is in *proving* they've fulfilled the criteria, not necessarily *doing* it, especially with more open-ended curricula.
- Most lesson-planning and advanced prep isn't necessary until around junior high and high school.

It's worth noting that these are all *approximate*. Your [culture](people-culture.md) will emphasize some and de-emphasize others, and the requirements are assigned by your region's culture.

### Pre-K

Since you're trying to raise your children instead of [acculturate](people-culture.md) them to a [learning-restrictive](education.md) classroom environment, keep working on [qualities that make moral, hard-working children](parenting-children.md).

You can teach small children as young as 3 years old to read:

1. Teach the most common phoneme (how it sounds) for each letter.
2. Teach them to blend those phonemes into simple words by saying the word fast.
3. Teach them to parse harder words: secondary phonemes, digigraphs (multiple letters making 1 sound), and silent "e" indicating a long vowel sound.
4. Intentionally practice 30--60 minutes a day through a text, *without* pre-reading skills and drilling specific words.

However, Pre-K children who learn to read will probably not retain most of their learning, so only teach it as far as they would like to explore it.

### Kindergarten

Most kindergarten schooling is simply creating the "standards" that will later become more in-depth studying. In many ways, kindergarten is more important for *you* as a parent to start the [habit](habits.md) of educating than for them to actually "learn" anything.

### High School

Generally, high school homeschoolers will diverge based on the situation.

There are *many* specializations in high school, but there's a wide range of educational requirements based on region, and an even *wider* range of the available options for the student.

- Most of the time, there are a wide variety of applied courses, including [auto repair](autos.md), [home economics](home-housekeeping.md), [cooking](cooking.md), or [communications](people-3_respect.md).
- Literacy can range from simply revisiting 8th Grade up to working with collegiate-level literature (e.g., British Literature).
- Math can range from a slightly more advanced algebra, all the way into trigonometry, statistics, and [calculus](math-calc.md).
- Science starts focusing on more specific domains like biology, chemistry, and physics.
- Humanities typically involves *much* more political discussion, as well as [economic theory](economics.md) and more details on how governments work.
- Arts branch out into a vast set of specializations which may include painting, visual arts, woodworking, or performance arts.

Depending on the situation, older students can try going to school online (e.g., [Khan World School](https://asuprep.asu.edu/khan-world-school/)). If they're self-determining and their lifestyle can still be balanced outside a classroom, it's worth considering.

### Graduating

They have several ways to graduate high school:

1. The culturally standardized route is to sit in high school classrooms, pass the classes, and pass the exit exam.
   - If you even marginally succeeded, they'll pass the exit exam before even starting the classroom sessions (it often requires an 8th-grade reading/math level).
2. Find a work-at-your-own-pace high school online, then pass the credits more quickly, without the social experience.
3. Get an unconventional certification (e.g., [GED](https://ged.com/)) or a diploma through a homeschool group.
   - They can convert a GED to a diploma later via college.
   - The homeschool group diploma won't have as much influence as a GED.
   - Either way, they can completely resolve any discrepancy with social status if they get an associate's degree from a community college (which is usually worth the time and money).

You won't really know the best approach until at least 8th Grade, since it all depends on them.

- A particularly intelligent can typically pass the high school exit exam by the time they're in 8th Grade.
- They may *really* want to explore high school for the social experience (e.g., prom, athletics).
- If they're not particularly focused on anything (which is typical), they should start considering their [career](jobs-1_why.md) and find classes that feed into their preferred specialization.
- Generally, [colleges](jobs-college.md) will care about a *diploma* (rather than a GED), but don't care that it was completed early.
- If they already know what they want or the home has started growing dysfunctional from their adolescence, send them somewhere else to complete their education (e.g., prep school, military school).

Many [colleges](jobs-college.md) don't necessarily look at early graduation as a positive thing.

- Instead, if they want college, they should use that extra time to accrue extra college credit via dual enrollment.
- While their academic achievement may matter, they should *also* spend time on personal development (e.g., [making friends](people-4_friends.md), [pursuing hobbies](fun.md)).

Their [coming of age](parenting-3_teenagers.md) involves several possible scenarios:

1. They move out to [explore their career](jobs-1_why.md) with what you've given them.
2. They adopt [something related](jobs-specialization.md) to *your* career.
3. If they don't like either of those two options, they'll have to find their path (which guarantees moving out if you [live somewhat remotely](home-homestead.md)).
4. If you can afford it, [send them](parenting-3_teenagers.md) on a journey:
   - Send them to [college](jobs-college.md).
   - Give them a few thousand dollars and a one-way ticket to somewhere they want to travel (e.g., Europe).
