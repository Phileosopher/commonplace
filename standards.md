# The setting of standardized design

As [specialized](jobs-specialization.md) grow larger, the people in the industry need some agreed-upon configuration.

- There is often a "best" way to do things based on the current [technology](technology.md) or [natural supply chain](logistics.md).
- There often needs to be a formalized [educational curriculum](education.md) for new apprentices in that trade.

Eventually, everyone agrees to assign at least some specialists who do nothing *but* set standards.

## The standard setters

There are [a *lot* of standard-setting organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_technical_standard_organizations). Some of them are non-profit and others are for-profit, and their pricing/membership model for individuals varies wildly from "totally free" to "free to have (but not reproduce) if you pay a few hundred dollars".

These standard-setting groups move around as technology changes, scandals happen, new technologies replace old, and another group makes a new set of standards.

## Issues with standards

Sometimes, standards don't always make sense, but they did at one point.

- New technology has a tendency to render entire domains of older technology obsolete, but the jargon and configurations will stay as a convention.

Other times, standards aren't always communicated.

- The US had planned to adopt the metric system in 1793, but pirates hijacked the ship carrying the official meter and kilogram.
