# The BASIC programming language

While BASIC has largely gone out of style, it was designed to be a syntactically easy language, and most of its future iterations (e.g., QBasic, Visual Basic) keep that simplicity.

In the spirit of that simplicity, Scratch is probably the best programming language for easy accessibility. It uses a convenient [GUI](engineering-graphics.md) that makes it *very* [kid-friendly](parenting-children.md).
