
HOW TO BE A GOOD CUSTOMER

I work in IT and can confidently say that providing bribery in terms of food or snack will 100% get your issue taken care of faster and will help you jump the line in the ticket queue.
I call this "The Swedish Fish Technique." Works absolute wonders for me.
Had to send my PS5 in for an issue just out of warranty. Included several packets of Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish from Halloween since we had them left over. My wife looked at me like I was crazy. 
Not so crazy when it was suddenly a covered repair, huh?
I'm taking notes
You want to use stuff that ships well and can handle cold and hot. A Snickers is great, a Snickers that melted then got stuck under something in the box is a mess.
As a client, I regularly brought lunch to the IT guy assigned to my case (when he physically had to come by). This got me his cell number and placement at the top of the queue anytime in the future. Well worth the small expense.

Many online retailers have what’s called “Cart Abandonment” marketing strategies.
If you put something in your cart and then don’t check out, you’ll likely receive an email or some kind of messaging with a discount code to incentivize conversion.
If you’re gonna buy something online, always at least try adding to your cart and leaving first before buying.

I work for an airline. I manage the development of the system our call center agents use. "Please" and "thank you" will unlock magical doors of help when you're on the phone with the agents or are at the airport dealing with airport staff. Simple politeness no longer seems to exist in these interactions. I've shadowed agents to understand how they use what my teams develop and I can count on two hands in the 150-200 calls I've listened into over the last year where the caller was polite and acted decently towards the other human on the other end of the line.
