# How to pray

We must [sincerely](understanding-certainty.md) and wholly pray to God, never mindlessly ([Matthew 6:7](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm)).

For most people, prayer is our most neglected [spiritual discipline](spiritual-exercises.md), and requires us to [recondition](habits.md) every time we are [afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md) or [angry](mind-feelings-anger.md).

- Most Christians' issues come from not spending enough time with God.
- People who pray intentionally several times a day *never* become spiritually complacent.

Praying is constant communication with God as life happens, not merely asking Him for things or help.

- That's not saying He *doesn't* give us good things that we ask for ([Matthew 7:11](https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-11.htm)).
- But, by praying, we engage in a type of partnership with God, where He is part of our daily and hourly lives.

However, prayer works for literally everything.

God doesn't "need" you to pray, and He can fix everything *without* our prayer.

- God designed the entire universe for a relationship with Him, and prayer is the back-end opportunity for us to connect Him into *everything*.

God also doesn't cross our boundaries, including things we want to take control of ourselves.

- When we give over control and [trust Him](understanding-certainty.md), He'll act, but is also loving enough to permit us to experience our consequences.

Even *extremely* busy people have room for prayer:

- Time in the bathroom
- Commuting to and from work
- During routine or mindless work
- Quiet, non-thought times during [personal hobbies](fun.md) and [exercise](body-exercise.md)

While Catholics believe it more than Protestants, you certainly *can* pray to believers who have come before us.

- This is called "veneration" or intercessory prayer, where you're asking them to pray for you.
- The practice may or may not be accurate, depending on very few Bible verses that cover the subject.
  - In the absence of information, each person should be fully convinced of what they wish to do ([Romans 14:5](https://biblehub.com/romans/14-5.htm)).
- Irrespective, your reasons for doing it should be out of a communal connection with other believers, but with the full knowledge that God is in control.

## Things worth discussing with Him

Upcoming opportunities and risks:

- Ask for His blessing for the upcoming day.
- What appears to be the [best option](people-decisions.md) might be a bad idea, so pray for God to accomplish [His will](god-will.md).
- Ask for wisdom for decisions and success in them.
- Ask for strength to endure any upcoming challenges, and that it comes through love.

Feelings, desires, and thoughts:

- Give each [concern](purpose.md) to Him, one by one.
- Ask for Him to remove all your [anxiety](mind-feelings-fear.md) and give you faith, hope, and love.
- Ask and submit every problem to His will.
- Pray for peace from the Holy Spirit.
- Pray for a more Christ-like heart and a stronger passion for people He wants you to love.
- If you have any recurring desires, request that He take away everything that maintains your selfishness.

Others' thoughts, ideas, and feelings:

- Ask for God to work on their hearts and minds.
- Ask for God to give them strength and guidance.

Relationships and social dynamics:

## Pray sincerely

We pray through our hearts, not through speaking.

- Speaking, however, can help prayer [feel](mind-feelings.md) more real to us.
- While the Bible doesn't *specifically* say to pray before food, gratitude should provoke the routine.

We must also have good motives for our prayers.

- God doesn't honor prayers for selfish desires ([James 4:2-4](https://biblehub.com/james/4.htm)).

If you have the right attitude and want what He desires, God will *always* answer your prayers ([Mark 11:24](https://biblehub.com/mark/11-24.htm)).

- God loves heartfelt devotion, so He answers specific prayers for [good](morality.md) things much more frequently than vague ones.
- God doesn't usually give what we don't ask for, so ask persistently and intentionally ([Luke 18:1-8](https://biblehub.com/luke/18.htm)).

Jesus gives Christians the best way to pray while maintaining a healthy perspective ([Matthew 6:9-13](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm)):

1. Use one of God's names and remember He's your heavenly father.
2. Ask for His will to be done on earth in the same way He has it in heaven.
3. Ask Him to provide today's physical needs.
4. Ask Him to forgive any sins in the same way that you've [forgiven others' sins](hardship-forgiveness.md) against you.
5. Ask for [protection and safety](safety.md) from [evil](morality-evil.md) and destruction.
6. Thank him and acknowledge His complete [power and authority](power.md).

## Routines worth considering

There's some [controversy](people-conflicts-christian-why.md) over Jesus' admonition against repetition ([Matthew 6:7](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm)).

- Your actual *conversation* with God is where you'll experience any spirituality, with the rest of it taking up more time.
- However, everyone has a different [personality](personality.md), so you may need more [ritual](habits.md) if you're lower on the Openness spectrum.

Place yourself in a familiar position such as kneeling or laying face-down.

Add nonverbal mantra-less [meditation](awareness.md) to your prayer (i.e., contemplative prayer).

- The extra time can help you to calm yourself to stay more focused on Him.

You can intensify your prayer with fasting ([Mark 9:29](https://biblehub.com/mark/9-29.htm), [Acts 14:23](https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm)).

- Fasting is critical for growing in Christ, but only for the right reasons ([Matthew 6:16-18](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm)).
- Even fasting for a few hours or a day can have an effect on your spirituality.
- On an even farther level, you can take a *major* step in faith by dry fasting (i.e., not taking in *any* food or drink).

The Jesus Prayer is popular among Catholics:

- "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."
- Eastern Orthodox takes the ritual *very* far, to the point of making it the cornerstone of a form of asceticism called "hesychasm".
