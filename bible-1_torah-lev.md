# Leviticus commentary

the Law is not as heartless as Christian culture implies.

- The laying hands on the head is a direct transmission, and means a *personal* connection of sin with others.
- Tt is a bonding together through a type of shared [shame](mind-feelings-shame.md).

For the priest:

- flawless young bull
- lay hand on head
- slaughter
- some blood on the Meeting Tent
- dip finger, sprinkle 7 times toward front of sanctuary veil-canopy
- some blood on the horns of the incense altar
- pour the rest of the blood out at base of the burnt offering altar
- take the fat, kidneys, and lobe of liver, and offer in smoke on the burnt offering altar
- take everything else to a ceremonially clean place and burn on a fatty ash pile

For the whole congregation:

- only for unintentional sins
- everything is the same, except:
  - no blood on the altar of incense
  - only fat on the burnt offering altar

For the leader:

- same as the congregation, but a goat and not a bull

For the common person:

- same as the leader, but a female goat
- can bring a flawless female sheep instead

Conclusion:

1. God sees the priest (and any spiritual leadership) as 2 extra things compared to everyone else:
   1. the "aroma" of the organization that sets the "gist" of the group
   2. the moral "filter" of the entire Body
   - He also judges them harshly on the Law, irrespective of intention, since they're responsible to morally lead (e.g., Luke 17:2 about the millstone around the neck and jumping in a lake)
2. God sees the congregation as a collective entity, *not* just each individual.
   - He gives grace to all of us over our unintentional sins relative to the intentional ones, even under the Law.
3. God makes a clear demarcation between leaders and spiritual leaders.
   - This is demonstrated by a goat sacrifice versus a bull.
   - This is often missed in modern Christian culture.
4. A common person is given more grace.
   - The aspect of a female indicates the "feminine" qualities represented by those who follow (i.e., dominance hierarchy mindset of this world with respect to [gender associations](gender.md)).
   - The accommodation of a sheep instead of a goat indicates His willingness to work with us when we're really not able to meet a stringent demand (e.g., [financial difficulty](hardship-poverty.md)).

## 25:8-13

the Year of Jubilee means things "snap back" to the original owner.

- In many ways, this is how God uses the elect: the elect may suffer or lose, but then their inheritance "snaps back" after a season of severity.
- The only difference in God's work is that it comes through when *God* redeems, not simply a fixed calendar period.
  - This doesn't, however, incapacitate His ability to use numerology. Many patterns in the Bible show this, and I imagine believers likely have similar numerology patterns in their daily life.
    - At the same time, hunting down that numerology isn't worth doing. That's best reserved for the others watching us, as well as our possible review of the story in the future.
