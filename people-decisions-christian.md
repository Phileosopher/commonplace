# How to decide wisely as a Christian

Most Christians tend to use spiritual jargon to hide their [anxiety](mind-feelings-fear.md).

- One of the most common forms is through asking "what is [God's will](god-will.md) for my life".

In general, however, they miss the point.

## God's will is relatively simple to understand

A. Have an eternal relationship with Jesus Christ:

- He wants everyone to [come to repentance](https://theologos.site/gospel/) for their [sins](morality-sins.md) ([2 Peter 3:9](https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm), [John 3:16](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm)).
- Deeply understand Jesus and who we are with him.
- Purse Christ above everything else instead of as a religion or mystical experience.

B. Let God sanctify us:

- Sanctification is setting something aside for a holy purpose ([1 Thessalonians 4](https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4.htm)).
- Remove any [sins](morality-sins.md) that could get in between ourselves and God.
  - This comes through daily doing the good works God planned for us to do ([Ephesians 2:10](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm))
- Be holy like Jesus ([1 Peter 1:15-16](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1.htm)).

C. Let God fill us with the Holy Spirit:

- Live by the power of the Holy Spirit, not [feelings](mind-feelings.md) or [knowledge](understanding.md)
  - [Galatians 5:16-25](https://biblehub.com/galatians/5.htm)
  - [1 Corinthians 10:31](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm)
  - [Ephesians 5:17](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-17.htm)
- He will guide us along straight paths ([Proverbs 4:11](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-11.htm))
- We *must* act in the Spirit's power, since our own [decision-making capacity](people-decisions-calculus.md) will drift from God's plans.

D. Stay humble with everyone:

- Practice [spiritual exercises](spiritual-exercises.md) and [change bad habits](https://adequate.life/habits/) as we discover them ([1 Peter 2](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2.htm)).

E. Suffer righteously:

1. God permits difficulty and [hardship](hardship.md) to [educate](education.md) us ([1 Peter 4:19](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-19.htm)).
2. We endure the trials long enough to learn the lesson, with progressively worse situations, until we've experienced what we needed to endure.
3. Once we've completed a trial, He gives us rest to recover from the struggle, then gives us another trial.

F. Act when He calls us to special projects:

- There is a time and place for everything under the sun ([Ecclesiastes 3:1-8](https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm)).
- Most of the Bible involves people who were performing a relatively uninteresting life until God called them to a (typically unexpected) interesting role.

G. Thank Him for His availability and our situation:

- One of the most significant signs of a healthy Christian walk is gratitude ([Ephesians 5](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5.htm)).
- In general, Christians should have nothing to [be afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md) of, not even *death* ([1 Corinthians 15:54-58](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15.htm)).

## It requires submission

All Christians must learn to submit to God.

- Full submission isn't the same as being completely [sin](morality-sins.md)-free (1 John 1:8).

God gives us distance for us to grow through submission:

- This journey is a spiritual [rite of passage](maturity.md) ([Exodus](https://biblehub.com/exodus/1.htm), [Matthew 4:1-10](https://biblehub.com/matthew/4.htm)).
- God designed that hardship to provoke us to better [spiritual exercises](spiritual-exercises.md) ([2 Corinthians 4:7-10](https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4.htm)).
- Some believers presume *all* life with Christ is this wilderness, while others imagine that it simply never happens.

An entirely submissive Christian wants to do anything God wants:

- Authentic expression of faith through worship and devotion to God
- Very little concern for circumstances they can't control
- Willing to sacrifice anything for others' benefit
- A strong focus on God's desires over personal goals or others' desires

We should only want to know God's will because we sincerely desire to please Him (i.e., "The Lord is leading" instead of "God told me to").

In general, we should want wisdom more than specific guidance:

- Wisdom is both fear and knowledge of God.
- Biblical wisdom is a disciplined and prudent life with a fear of the Lord ([Proverbs 9:10](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm)).
- Wisdom is more important than silver or gold ([Proverbs 8:11](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm)).
- We should longingly seek for wisdom.
- Wisdom gives freedom and life through understanding it ([Proverbs 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4.htm)).

## God doesn't usually provide details about His will

The Bible gives *plenty* of large-scale information, but doesn't clarify day-by-day decisions beyond [moral](morality.md) boundaries.

God directs people for several reasons at once:

- To build our character and holiness.
- To help us submit and adapt to God's kingdom.
- To help us make wise decisions.

God won't reveal information for His will if He knows we won't use it.

- He gives us what we need, but never more than that.
- We must do His will, step by step, and He will reveal it as we need it.
- He makes it *very* clear that we aren't supposed to worry about tomorrow ([Matthew 6:25-34](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm)).

He typically chastises sins quickly ([Psalm 23:4](https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm)), but we are free to explore within the boundaries.

The Bible does *not* guarantee external benefits:

- Health, physical wellness or a long life on earth
- Success in any form
- Physical restoration from past sins
- A leisurely or effortless life
- Financial prosperity
- Literal, direct messages or words from Him or angels
- Reasonable and low-stress challenges
  - God *frequently* gives us more than we can handle to force us to rely on Him!
- A stable lifestyle
  - Christians usually transition through cycles of hardship and prosperity ([Philippians 4:11-13](https://biblehub.com/philippians/4.htm))
- Any of the above for someone we care about

While there are promises of God's blessing, we have no place to expect it, and He prefers to give it in ways we can't anticipate.

## We really don't like to submit to God

In our attempts to [dialectically](logic.md) merge our will with God's we tend to complicate things.

Clear signs we haven't submitted:

- Using past and current events to define the future, in any capacity
- Failing to take [personal responsibility](meaning.md)
- Desiring an easier or more enjoyable life
- Excessive complaining or negativity
- Compulsions for instant gratification
- Self-pity, self-loathing, or strong sense of worthlessness
- Enviousness and jealousy
- Unwilling to try alternative or [unconventional](habits.md) methods

When we aren't at peace, we seek God's will for a few key reasons:

1. Anxiety or fear of perceived [consequences](results.md) ([Philippians 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/philippians/4.htm)).
2. [Fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) that we'll be held [responsible](meaning.md) for our [choices](people-decisions.md) ([Galatians 6:7-8](https://biblehub.com/galatians/6.htm)).
3. Our [desires](purpose.md) are split between personal fulfillment and following God ([Revelation 3:16](https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-16.htm)).

## Our techniques are often defective

We often defer responsibility for decisions to other people:

- By trusting others' judgments, we can abdicate responsibility.

Sometimes, we use raw [logic](logic.md) by deduction.

- This operates on a presumption that we have all the information.
- It's a huge reason why God tends to invalidate our approach ([Isaiah 55:8-9](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55.htm)).

We may use some form of divination, then say God gave us the answer.

- This can come through a variety of sources:
  1. [Feelings](mind-feelings.md) toward certain decisions.
  2. Randomly selected Bible verses that confirm a belief or choice.
- The only way to know for certain is to [test the spirits](spiritual-test.md).

## In our anxiety, we tend to over-assume

God *never* permits sinful lifestyles:

- He despises [sin](morality-sins.md) with a fierce passion ([Isaiah 59:2](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm))
- Many people will blame God or others for the [consequences](results.md) of their actions.
- Each Christian must take control of their own [decisions](people-decisions.md) before God gives them anything else.
- God's will doesn't give complete license to do whatever we want.

We tend to add aspects of what God wants to things we ourselves want:

- We often want to know God's long-term will, but aren't willing to do His short-term commands.
- God doesn't have a perfect target we must constantly hit every time.
- God's will isn't a complicated maze with special [rules](people-rules.md) and guidelines for success.
- A cynical attitude can easily complicate God's desires.
- God is consistent enough that [He'll provide](god-capabilities.md), but He's [creative](mind-creativity.md) enough that He never does the same thing twice.
- We don't know His motivations, but we must simply obey Him.

We often assume *our* will can't be changed, even by God.

- However, He can bend it to accomplish His purposes, and often with plenty of forethought to it ([Proverbs 21:1](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-1.htm))

## While in His will, we can do whatever we want

For most of our journeys, God tends to bring us through 3 phases:

1. Deliverance: He pulls us out of an unpleasant situation.
2. Transition: He changes us inwardly through experiences He places in that intermediate state.
3. Destiny: At the end, He places us in somewhere we would have never been prepared for if we hadn't gone through the transition.

The consequence of this is that we must stop acting and wait on Him.

- Typically, He moves slower than we'd prefer.
- On a practical level, we fulfill His will through patiently building [daily rituals](spiritual-exercises.md) that [ultimately serve others](church-serve.md).

When we have the right attitude with Him, *anything* we do is His will:

- God cares *far* more about our relationship with Him than [doctrines](theology.md), [churches](church.md), [living situation](homes-buysell.md), [career decisions](jobs-1_why.md), [friendships](people-friends.md), [relationships](relationships-marriage.md), and [family decisions](parenting-babies.md) ([Matthew 10:37](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm)).
- Eat and drink what we want, assuming it doesn't harm others' conscience ([1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm)).
- Travel or live anywhere we want, assuming He didn't call us to go somewhere ([Acts 8:26-27](https://biblehub.com/acts/8.htm)).
- [Associate](people-friends.md) with anyone we want, assuming we weren't called to a specific ministry.
- In general, adopt any lifestyle we want that's [loving](people-love.md).

## Ideal techniques for guidance

Practice discipline in finding wisdom:

- [Pray](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md) consistently.
- Ask advice from wise people in the [Church](church.md).
- Read the Bible frequently.
- Take time to consider decisions.
- Research and learn anything we need to know.
- Focus strictly on things we can change and trust God for the rest.

We can make a few tests for specific [decisions](people-decisions.md):

1. Bible: Has [the Bible](bible.md) already spoken about it?
2. Secrecy: Does it have the appearance of [deviousness](legal-crimes.md)? ([Proverbs 11:3](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm)).
3. Example: Does it demonstrate good moral conduct for others who see it? ([1 Timothy 4:12](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm)).
4. Allegiance: Does the decision focus on honoring God first? ([Galatians 1:10](https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm)).
5. Group integrity: Can the action cause someone else to morally backslide? ([Romans 14:21](https://biblehub.com/romans/14-21.htm)).
6. Peace: Have you [prayed](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md) on the decision and found peace with it? ([Philippians 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/philippians/4.htm))
7. Covenant: Will it violate a standard or promise you personally made with God?
8. Glory: Will it give God the reputation He deserves? ([1 Corinthians 10:31](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm))

And, if we have any unease about it, it deduces into several non-exclusive reasons:

- Our will isn't surrendered to Him
  - Impure motives
  - Unwillingness to suffer
- Impulsiveness
  - Making decisions too quickly
  - Analyzing before seeking God's will
  - Seeking others' opinions over God's will
  - Impatience in God's timing
- Self-deception about our moral state
  - Not repenting of known sin
  - Unwilling to admit sins we weren't aware of
  - Ignoring or minimizing the impact of our decision
  - Lying about failure, even when small
- Insufficient spiritual exercises
  - Not praying continually and earnestly
  - Not reading our Bible enough
- Expecting God won't answer
- [Anxiety](mind-feelings-fear.md)
  - Over what people may say or think
  - Over God rejecting us
