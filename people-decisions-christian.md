# How to decide wisely as a Christian

Most Christians tend to use spiritual jargon to hide their [anxiety](mind-feelings-fear.md).

- One of the most common forms is through asking "what is [God's will](god-will.md) for my life".

In general, however, they miss the point.

## God's will is relatively simple to understand

A. Have an eternal relationship with Jesus Christ:

- He wants everyone to [come to repentance](https://theologos.site/gospel/) for their [sins](morality-sins.md) ([2 Peter 3:9](https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm), [John 3:16](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm)).
- Deeply understand Jesus and who you are with him.
- Purse Christ above everything else instead of as a religion or mystical experience.

B. Let God sanctify you:

- Sanctification is setting something aside for a holy purpose ([1 Thessalonians 4](https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4.htm)).
- Remove any [sins](morality-sins.md) that could get in between you and God.
  - This comes through daily doing the good works God planned for us to do ([Ephesians 2:10](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm))
- Be holy like Jesus ([1 Peter 1:15-16](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1.htm)).

C. Let God fill you with the Holy Spirit:

- Live by the power of the Holy Spirit, not [feelings](mind-feelings.md) or [knowledge](understanding.md)
  - [Galatians 5:16-25](https://biblehub.com/galatians/5.htm)
  - [1 Corinthians 10:31](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm)
  - [Ephesians 5:17](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-17.htm)
- He will guide us along straight paths ([Proverbs 4:11](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-11.htm))
- We *must* act in the Spirit's power, since our own [decision-making capacity](people-decisions-calculus.md) will drift from God's plans.

D. Stay humble with everyone:

- Practice [spiritual exercises](spiritual-exercises.md) and [change bad habits](https://adequate.life/habits/) as you discover them ([1 Peter 2](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2.htm)).

E. Suffer righteously:

1. God permits difficulty and [hardship](hardship.md) to [educate](education.md) us ([1 Peter 4:19](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-19.htm)).
2. We endure the trials long enough to learn the lesson, with progressively worse situations, until we've experienced what we needed to endure.
3. Once we've completed a trial, He gives us rest to recover from the struggle, then gives us another trial.

F. Act when He calls us to special projects:

- There is a time and place for everything under the sun ([Ecclesiastes 3:1-8](https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm)).
- Most of the Bible involves people who were performing a relatively uninteresting life until God called them to a (typically unexpected) interesting role.

G. Thank Him for His availability and your situation:

- One of the most significant signs of a healthy Christian walk is gratitude ([Ephesians 5](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5.htm)).
- In general, Christians should have nothing to [be afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md) of, not even *death* ([1 Corinthians 15:54-58](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15.htm)).

## It requires submission

All Christians must learn to submit to God.

- Full submission isn't the same as being completely [sin](morality-sins.md)-free (1 John 1:8).

God gives us distance for us to grow through submission:

- This journey is a spiritual [rite of passage](maturity.md) ([Exodus](https://biblehub.com/exodus/1.htm), [Matthew 4:1-10](https://biblehub.com/matthew/4.htm)).
- God designed that hardship to provoke us to better [spiritual exercises](spiritual-exercises.md) ([2 Corinthians 4:7-10](https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4.htm)).
- Some believers presume *all* life with Christ is this wilderness, while others imagine that it simply never happens.

An entirely submissive Christian wants to do anything God wants:

- Authentic expression of faith through worship and devotion to God
- Very little concern for circumstances they can't control
- Willing to sacrifice anything for others' benefit
- A strong focus on God's desires over personal goals or others' desires

We should only want to know God's will because we sincerely desire to please Him (i.e., "The Lord is leading" instead of "God told me to").

In general, we should want wisdom more than specific guidance:

- Wisdom is both fear and knowledge of God.
- Biblical wisdom is a disciplined and prudent life with a fear of the Lord ([Proverbs 9:10](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm)).
- Wisdom is more important than silver or gold ([Proverbs 8:11](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm)).
- We should longingly seek for wisdom.
- Wisdom gives freedom and life through understanding it ([Proverbs 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4.htm)).

## God doesn't usually provide details about His will

The Bible gives *plenty* of large-scale information, but doesn't clarify day-by-day decisions beyond [moral](morality.md) boundaries.

God directs people for several reasons at once:

- To build our character and holiness.
- To help us submit and adapt to God's kingdom.
- To help us make wise decisions.

He gives us what we need, but never more than that.

- We get enough information to know the right decision, and that's it.
- He makes it *very* clear that we aren't supposed to worry about tomorrow ([Matthew 6:25-34](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm)).

He typically chastises sins quickly ([Psalm 23:4](https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm)), but we are free to explore within the boundaries.

The Bible does *not* guarantee external benefits:

- Health, physical wellness or a long life on earth
- Success in any form
- Physical restoration from past sins
- A leisurely or effortless life
- Financial prosperity
- Literal, direct messages or words from Him or angels
- Reasonable and low-stress challenges
  - God *frequently* gives you more than you can handle to force you to rely on Him!
- A stable lifestyle
  - Christians usually transition through cycles of hardship and prosperity ([Philippians 4:11-13](https://biblehub.com/philippians/4.htm))
- Any of the above for someone you care about

While there are promises of God's blessing, we have no place to expect it, and He prefers to give it in ways we can't anticipate.

## We really don't like to submit to God

In our attempts to [dialectically](logic.md) merge our will with God's we tend to complicate things.

Clear signs we haven't submitted:

- Using past and current events to define the future, in any capacity
- Failing to take [personal responsibility](meaning.md)
- Desiring an easier or more enjoyable life
- Excessive complaining or negativity
- Compulsions for instant gratification
- Self-pity, self-loathing, or strong sense of worthlessness
- Enviousness and jealousy
- Unwilling to try alternative or [unconventional](habits.md) methods

When we aren't at peace, we seek God's will for a few key reasons:

1. Anxiety or fear of perceived [consequences](results.md) ([Philippians 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/philippians/4.htm)).
2. [Fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) that we'll be held [responsible](meaning.md) for our [choices](people-decisions.md) ([Galatians 6:7-8](https://biblehub.com/galatians/6.htm)).
3. Our [desires](purpose.md) are split between personal fulfillment and following God ([Revelation 3:16](https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-16.htm)).

## In our anxiety, we tend to over-assume

God *never* permits sinful lifestyles:

- He despises [sin](morality-sins.md) with a fierce passion ([Isaiah 59:2](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm))
- Many people will blame God or others for the [consequences](results.md) of their actions.
- Each Christian must take control of their own [decisions](people-decisions.md) before God gives them anything else.
- God's will doesn't give complete license to do whatever we want.

We tend to add aspects of what God wants to things we ourselves want:

- We often want to know God's long-term will, but aren't willing to do His short-term commands.
- God doesn't have a perfect target we must constantly hit every time.
- God's will isn't a complicated maze with special [rules](people-rules.md) and guidelines for success.
- A cynical attitude can easily complicate God's desires.
- God is consistent enough that [He'll provide](god-capabilities.md), but He's [creative](mind-creativity.md) enough that He never does the same thing twice.
- We don't know His motivations, but we must simply obey Him.

## Our techniques are often defective

We often defer responsibility for decisions to other people:

- By trusting others' judgments, we can abdicate responsibility.

We may use some form of divination, then say God gave us the answer.

- This can come through a variety of sources:
  1. [Feelings](mind-feelings.md) toward certain decisions.
  2. Randomly selected Bible verses that confirm a belief or choice.
- The only way to know for certain is to [test the spirits](spiritual-test.md).

## Ideal techniques for guidance

Practice discipline in finding wisdom:

- [Pray](spiritual-exercises-prayer.md) consistently.
- Ask advice from wise people in the [Church](church.md).
- Read the Bible frequently.
- Take time to consider decisions.
- Research and learn anything you need to know.
- Focus strictly on things you can change and trust God for the rest.

## While in His will, you can do whatever you want

If you have the right attitude with Him, *anything* you do is His will:

- God cares *far* more about your relationship with Him than [doctrines](theology.md), [churches](church.md), [living situation](homes-buysell.md), [career decisions](jobs-1_why.md), [friendships](people-friends.md), [relationships](relationships-marriage.md), and [family decisions](parenting-babies.md) ([Matthew 10:37](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm)).
- Eat and drink what you want, assuming it doesn't harm others' conscience ([1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm)).
- Travel or live anywhere you want, assuming He didn't call you to go somewhere ([Acts 8:26-27](https://biblehub.com/acts/8.htm)).
- [Associate](people-friends.md) with anyone you want, assuming you weren't called to a specific ministry.
- In general, adopt any lifestyle you want that's [loving](people-love.md).

Of course, God knows what you'll do anyway, so you can never botch the plans He has already.

On a more practical level, the most sufficient fulfillment of His will comes through [daily rituals in Christ](spiritual-exercises.md) and [serving others](church-serve.md).

## Even when we fail, God still uses it

Anecdotally, many believers have sinned spectacularly (e.g., the apostle Paul) and God has been able to use them for an even greater work.

- This doesn't come without its own [hardships](hardship.md).
  - However, God gives us [meaning](meaning.md) through that hardship.
  - This meaning-via-hardship mechanism is a huge aspect for how Christians hold to their faith, since their perseverance proves the efficacy of the God who supports them.
