If you see any of their quirks that *really* annoy you, they'll get *much* worse as you get to know them.

None of these signs are necessarily unsolvable, but don't intensify the relationship without [awareness](awareness.md) of how to fix or avoid them.

However, nobody is entirely "perfect" for you because everyone is somewhat broken, so your [personality](personality.md) may work well against some of them.

They're psychologically or physically abusive:

- Abusive people usually [disrespect boundaries](people-3_respect.md) without realizing it.
- If they disrespect you, it'll only get worse as you grow closer.
- Never rationalize abusive behavior.
- Physically abusive people can't control their anger once it boils over.
- Living with an abusive person is a minefield of avoiding outbursts.

- They feel the need to help others but impose that need into the relationship.
- They're afraid of loneliness and use someone's physical presence to prevent it.
- They're bringing deep psychological issues from their childhood into the relationship and are desperately needy with unclear expectations.
- If you carry on with it, you'll become the other half of a destructive and overly codependent lifestyle.

Overly controlling:

  - At its most extreme, jealous people will envy strong family ties and completely platonic friends.
- Controlling people have crippling insecurities.
- If you find manipulative behavior attractive, imagine it for the rest of your life.
- Even when you pity their lack of self-control, you're letting them hurt you and others without consequences.
- If they sever ties with someone else without discussing it with you, they've started over-controlling your life.

- Hypersensitive about themselves or their image.
- Over-identifies with their sexuality or expects that everyone else identifies strictly as sexual beings.
- Insecure male identities hold to rigid roles without discussion, are extremely jealous, and try to control others.

Self-absorbed:

- Self-absorbed people care way too much about themselves to care about you.
- They're usually overly concerned about image, only talk about themselves, or assert superiority needlessly.

- If someone is meeting their needs through you without considering your feelings, they're being psychologically abusive.

They're perpetually miserable:

- [Working through personal issues](awareness.md) is good, but not when everyone else is having fun!
- Everyone has a baseline [happiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md) they revert to when there's no outside pressure, and you can't change that.

- Living in excess with [money](money-1_why.md) or resources, neglecting [self-maintenance](people-2_image.md), and taking unnecessary risks is disrespecting their own boundaries.

- They're usually [lying](people-lying.md) about many seemingly unimportant things or constantly breaking promises.
