# How to handle conflicts

Conflict requires high-stress communication:

- Every conflict requires [speaking well](language-speaking.md) and [maintaining your composure](awareness.md), which requires [managing stress](mind-feelings-happiness-stress.md) to avoid saying something you'll regret.
- Your [internalized subconscious trauma](hardship.md) will very often add more problems to the conflict, so [self-awareness](awareness.md) is *absolutely* critical to understand what you're feeling moment-to-moment.
- When conflicts go poorly, we suffer [tremendous misery](mind-feelings-happiness-stress.md) from prolonged thinking about it, as well as [anticipatory pain](hardship.md) later.

When used correctly, conflict benefits everyone involved:

- If you ask for what you want correctly, you can usually get it.
- When driven by [love](people-love.md), conflicts drive each person to understand each other more, and relationships become stronger from it (especially [marriage](relationships-marriage.md)).
- Open-minded participants of conflicts often become more [aware](awareness.md) of themselves and [how they may appear](people-image-why.md).
- After healthy conflicts, people are less afraid to open up further discussions about future conflicts, which strengthens [relationships](people-friends.md) and harmonizes their [culture](people-culture.md).
- Critical conflicts, handled correctly, can make or break entire [organizations](groups-large.md).

However, you need [the correct attitude](people-conflicts-attitudes.md) for approaching conflicts correctly.

Deferring conflict magnifies it:

- All conflicts are risky, but the earliest possible moment to address it is typically the lowest-risk time to approach it.
- Stalling a conflict, even a small one, makes it worse.
  - Many conflicts require [lying](people-lying.md) to stall it.
  - Even without lying, the conflict sits as an [unresolved problem](purpose.md) interfering with [the perfect harmony we all desire](goodlife.md).
- [Close relationships](people-friends.md) require trust, which requires talking out conflicts.

Most [casual conflicts](people-conflicts-casual.md) can be easily managed without much effort.

[Disagreements](people-conflicts-disagreements.md) can be difficult, but are often necessary when casual conflicts escalate.

- While disagreeing may generally be avoidable, it may become a [crucial conflict](people-conflicts-crucial.md) and must be addressed correctly.

## Sneaky tactics

Some people are completely impossible to please, and should always be a low priority compared to everyone and everything else.

Note subversive tactics:

- Most people who use subversive tactics know how to provoke others' [feelings](mind-feelings.md) on command.
- Your only resistance to those tactics is with [awareness](awareness.md) of your feelings and self-discipline against your impulses.
- If you're caught unaware, that person can usually reveal your weaknesses and [break you down](people-image-distortion.md).
- Avoid spending much time around these tactics, since they destroy your [happiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md) across the rest of your life and [influence](power-influence.md) you to perform those actions on others.
- If you choose to be around people who use devious tactics, [spend time with better friends](people-friends.md) to offset how much they'll influence you.
- While you *can* use subversive tactics with others, maintain your moral standards.

If you expect underhanded tactics:

1. Recognize what they're doing.
   - Only observe it to ignore it.
   - Never let it affect the conversation unless you *want* to address it.
2. At *any* time you feel uncomfortable or see the conflict going nowhere, step away from the conflict.
3. Sidestep their tactics.
   - Treat your statements as if someone is *constantly* recording what you say.
   - Never give a simple answer to a complicated question unless you fully accept its implied statement.
     - e.g., "Do you or don't you have the money you stole?"
     - Saying "Yes" or "No" is also implying, "I stole the money."
   - If you ever make a misstatement, own it immediately to prevent them from using it later.
     - If you justify it, do it on the basis of why you said it in the first place.
4. If they won't stop, draw attention to their tactic.
   - Negotiate your terms for continuing the discussion.
   - If they don't want to change their behavior in any way, step away from the conflict and promise to come back later when everyone is calmer.
5. Clarify new rules about how you'll respond to their behavior.
   - Do *not* give any new information that's unnecessary, since it can easily overwhelm.
   - Note that an underhanded tactic that worked in the past sets a precedent for future conflicts.

If you're in a new community that thrives on frequent conflict, find the highest-ranking member of the organization you expect to win against and antagonize them into a fight:

- If you're [perceptive](awareness.md), you'll likely win and become the most respected person in the room.
- However, don't take on more than you can handle: you're likely facing someone more experienced than you and probably has the favor of everyone else there.
- If you're publicly humiliated, graciously accept defeat and find a new community as soon as possible.

Watch for people who try to overpower the conversation:

- Some people try to subdue others through the force of their [personality](personality.md).

  - Their most defining characteristic is that they constantly keep interrupting you to say something that isn't clearly responding to what you stated.
  - They're not listening to you, but are simply trying to win an argument.

- There are several steps to stopping their behavior:
  1. Stop the interruption graciously and firmly.
     - Slow down your words to dramatically enhance what you're trying to say.
     - Gently put your hand up to express a boundary.
     - Politely express you want adequate time to make your point.
     - You *must* get a response from them.
     - This approach will work 90% of the time.
  2. Shame them when they don't honor your boundary:
     - Ask very specific questions that draw attention to their behavior.
     - You would like an answer from me, right?
     - Is it okay for me to finish my point?
     - Do you want an answer, or would you like to talk?
     - Resume the conversation where you left off, and avoid any smugness or rudeness.
     - This works 8 out of 10 times you need it (i.e., 8% of the time).
  3. If they don't respond to your boundary or shaming, leave them:
     - This is for the 2% of the people who can't respect your boundaries.
     - Make sure they receive the satisfaction of having the last word.

## Only create conflicts with a purpose in mind

When you become effective at conflicts, it's easy to engage with them whenever you want.

The only noble and worthwhile conflicts are driven by [love](people-love.md) for others:

- You *must* go easy on others, since we are all fragile, hurt people, irrespective of what we've done.
- Even if we don't love our opponents, we must [respect them](people-3_respect.md) in their position.

However, in unhealthy conflicts, exploiting something for others' gain may not be [wrong](morality-evil.md), but it's *never* [right](morality.md).

Don't worry about "winning", since getting an okay (but not great) deal very frequently [builds relationships](people-friends.md) in the process, and you can always revisit the situation after enough time passes.
