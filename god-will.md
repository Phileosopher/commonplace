# How to find God's will

Depending on the use of the word "will", God technically has three of them:

1. The unchanging [reality](reality.md) He built before time began.
   - This is the Father's viewpoint, and can't change.
2. His [desired](purpose.md) wish of what humanity's choices will be.
   - This is Jesus' viewpoint, and is concerned with salvation.
3. His directions, which aren't technically "wrong" or "right" in a [moral](morality.md) sense.
   - This is the Holy Spirit's viewpoint, and is subject to daily shifts and changes.
   - We usually mention His directions when we talk about God's will, and the primary cause of most Christians' anxiety.

All Christians must learn to submit to God

- Full submission isn't the same as being completely [sin](morality-sins.md)-free (1 John 1:8).

God gives us a season of distance to make us grow through submission:

- This journey is a spiritual [rite of passage](maturity.md) ([Exodus](https://biblehub.com/bsb/exodus/1.htm), [Matthew 4:1-10](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/4.htm)).
- God designed that hardship to provoke us to better [spiritual exercises](spiritual-exercises.md) ([2 Corinthians 4:7-10](https://biblehub.com/bsb/2_corinthians/4.htm)).
- Some believers presume *all* life with Christ is this wilderness, while others imagine that it simply never happens.

There are some clear signs we haven't submitted:

- Using past and current events to define the future, in any capacity
- Failing to take [personal responsibility](meaning.md)
- Desiring an easier or more enjoyable life
- Excessive complaining or negativity
- Compulsions for instant gratification
- Self-pity, self-loathing, or strong sense of worthlessness
- Enviousness and jealousy
- Unwilling to try alternative or [unconventional](habits.md) methods

An entirely submissive Christian wants to do anything God wants:

- Authentic expression of faith through worship and devotion to God
- Very little concern for circumstances they can't control
- Willing to sacrifice anything for others' benefit
- A strong focus on God's desires over personal goals or others' desires

## God doesn't usually provide details about His will

God directs people for several reasons at once:

- To build our character and holiness.
- To help us submit and adapt to God's kingdom.
- To help us make wise decisions.

He gives us what we need, but never more than that.

- We are given enough information to go through our day, and that's it.
- He makes it *very* clear that we aren't supposed to worry about tomorrow ([Matthew 6:25-34](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/6.htm)).

When we aren't at peace, we seek God's will for a few key reasons:

1. Anxiety or fear of perceived [consequences](results.md) ([Philippians 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/bsb/philippians/4.htm)).
2. [Fear](mind-feelings-fear.md) that we'll be held [responsible](meaning.md) for our [choices](people-decisions.md) ([Galatians 6:7-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/galatians/6.htm)).
3. Our [desires](purpose.md) are split between personal fulfillment and following God ([Revelation 3:16](https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-16.htm)).

We should only want to know God's will because we sincerely desire to please Him (i.e., "The Lord is leading" instead of "God told me to").

He typically chastises sins quickly ([Psalm 23:4](https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm)), but gives us the freedom to explore if we're living life wisely.

We do *not* find God's will with vague premonitions or divining:

1. [Feelings](mind-feelings.md) toward certain decisions.
2. Randomly selected Bible verses that confirm a belief or choice.
3. Anything that contradicts a passage in the Bible.

We should want wisdom more than specific guidance:

- Wisdom is both fear and knowledge of God.
- Biblical wisdom is a disciplined and prudent life with a fear of the Lord ([Proverbs 9:10](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm)).
- Wisdom is more important than silver or gold ([Proverbs 8:11](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm)).
- We should longingly seek for wisdom.
- Wisdom gives freedom and life through understanding it ([Proverbs 4:6-7](https://biblehub.com/bsb/proverbs/4.htm)).

Discipline yourself to wisdom:

- Pray consistently.
- Ask advice from wise people in the [Church](church.md).
- Read the Bible frequently.
- Take time to consider decisions.
- Research and learn anything you need to know.
- Focus strictly on things you can change and trust God for the rest.

## God's will is relatively simple to understand

A. Have an eternal relationship with Jesus Christ:

- He wants everyone to [come to repentance](jesus-gospel.md) for their [sins](morality-sins.md) ([2 Peter 3:9](https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm), [John 3:16](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm)).
- Deeply understand Jesus and who you are with him.
- Purse Christ above everything else instead of as a religion or mystical experience.

B. Let God sanctify you:

- Sanctification is setting something aside for a holy purpose ([1 Thessalonians 4](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_thessalonians/4.htm)).
- Remove any [sins](morality-sins.md) that could get in between you and God.
- Be holy like Jesus ([1 Peter 1:15-16](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_peter/1.htm)).

C. Let God fill you with the Holy Spirit:

- Live by the power of the Holy Spirit, not [feelings](mind-feelings.md) or [knowledge](understanding.md) ([Galatians 5:16-25](https://biblehub.com/bsb/galatians/5.htm), [1 Corinthians 10:31](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm), [Ephesians 5:17](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-17.htm)).

D. Stay humble with everyone:

- Practice [spiritual exercises](spiritual-exercises.md) and [change bad habits](https://adequate.life/habits/) as you discover them ([1 Peter 2](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_peter/2.htm)).

E. Suffer righteously:

1. God permits difficulty and [hardship](hardship.md) to [educate](education.md) us ([1 Peter 4:19](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-19.htm)).
2. We endure the trials long enough to learn the lesson, with progressively worse situations, until we've experienced what we needed to endure.
3. Once we've completed a trial, He gives us rest to recover from the struggle, then gives us another trial.

F. Act when He calls us to special projects:

- There is a time and place for everything under the sun ([Ecclesiastes 3:1-8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ecclesiastes/3.htm)).
- Most of the Bible involves people who were performing a relatively uninteresting life until God called them to a (typically unexpected) interesting role.

G. Thank Him for His availability and your situation:

- One of the most significant signs of a healthy Christian walk is gratitude ([Ephesians 5](https://biblehub.com/bsb/ephesians/5.htm)).
- In general, Christians should have nothing to [be afraid](mind-feelings-fear.md) of, not even *death* ([1 Corinthians 15:54-58](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/15.htm)).

## We complicate His will

God *never* permits sinful lifestyles:

- He despises [sin](morality-sins.md) with a fierce passion ([Isaiah 59:2](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-2.htm))
- Many people will blame God or others for the [consequences](results.md) of their actions.
- Each Christian must take control of their own [decisions](people-decisions.md) before God gives them anything else.
- God's will doesn't give complete license to do whatever we want.

We also tend to add aspects of what God wants:

- We often want to know God's long-term will, but aren't willing to do His short-term commands.
- God doesn't have a perfect target we must constantly hit every time.
- God's will isn't a complicated maze with special [rules](people-rules.md) and guidelines for success.
- A cynical attitude can easily complicate God's desires.
- God is consistent enough that [He'll provide](god-capabilities.md), but He's [creative](mind-creativity.md) enough that He never does the same thing twice.
- We don't know His motivations, but we must simply obey Him.

The Bible does *not* guarantee external benefits:

- Health, physical wellness or a long life on earth
- Success in any form
- Physical redemption from past sins
- A leisurely or effortless life
- Financial prosperity
- Literal, direct messages or words from Him or angels
- Reasonable and low-stress challenges
  - God *frequently* gives you more than you can handle to force you to rely on Him!
- A stable lifestyle
  - Christians usually transition through cycles of hardship and prosperity ([Philippians 4:11-13](https://biblehub.com/bsb/philippians/4.htm))
- Any of the above for someone you care about

## While in His will, you can do whatever you want

If you have the right attitude with Him, *anything* you do is His will:

If you have the right attitude with Him, *anything* you do is His will:

- God cares *far* more about your relationship with Him than [doctrines](theology.md), [churches](church.md), [living situation](homes-buysell.md), [career decisions](jobs-1_why.md), [friendships](people-4_friends.md), [relationships](relationships-marriage.md), and [family decisions](parenting-babies.md) ([Matthew 10:37](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm)).
- Eat and drink what you want, assuming it doesn't harm others' conscience ([1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_corinthians/8.htm)).
- Travel or live anywhere you want, assuming He didn't call you to go somewhere ([Acts 8:26-27](https://biblehub.com/bsb/acts/8.htm)).
- [Associate](people-4_friends.md) with anyone you want, assuming you weren't called to a specific ministry.
- In general, adopt any lifestyle you want that's [loving](people-love.md).

On a more practical level, the most sufficient fulfillment of His will comes through [daily rituals in Christ](spiritual-exercises.md) and [serving others](church-serve.md).
