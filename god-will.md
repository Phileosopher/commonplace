# God's will

God's "will" can be defined by the three main perspectives of the Trinity:

1. The unchanging [reality](reality.md) He built before time began.
   - This is the Father's viewpoint, and can't change.
2. His [desired](purpose.md) wish of what humanity's choices will be.
   - This is Jesus' viewpoint, and is concerned with [salvation](https://theologos.site/gospel/;) more than anything else.
3. His directions, which aren't technically "wrong" or "right" in a [moral](morality.md) sense.
   - This is the Holy Spirit's viewpoint, and is subject to daily shifts and changes.
   - We usually mention His directions when we talk about God's will, and the primary cause of most Christians' anxiety.

Therefore, the question of "Is it God's will that...?" can always be answered with *both* yes and no.

However, none of this is sufficient for most people.

- The *real* question they're asking is [how God's will applies to *their* decision-making](people-decisions-christian.md).
