# God's will

God's "will" can be defined by the three main perspectives of the Trinity:

1. The unchanging [reality](reality.md) He built before time began.
   - This is the Father's viewpoint, and can't change.
2. His [desired](purpose.md) wish of what humanity's choices will be.
   - This is Jesus' viewpoint, and is concerned with [salvation](https://theologos.site/gospel/;) more than anything else.
3. His directions, which aren't technically "wrong" or "right" in a [moral](morality.md) sense.
   - This is the Holy Spirit's viewpoint, and is subject to daily shifts and changes.
   - We usually mention His directions when we talk about God's will, and the primary cause of most Christians' anxiety.

Therefore, the question of "Is it God's will that...?" can always be answered with *both* yes and no.

To trust God is to trust God's character.

- If we knew what God knows and wanted what God wants, we'd completely agree He's making the best decision.

The events that unfold really have nothing to do with Whether we are in God's will or not.

- God knows what we'll do anyway, so we can never botch the plans He has already.

Anecdotally, many believers have sinned spectacularly (e.g., the apostle Paul) and God has been able to use them for an even greater work.

- This doesn't come without its own [hardships](hardship.md).
  - However, God gives us [meaning](meaning.md) through that hardship.
  - This meaning-via-hardship mechanism is a huge aspect for how Christians hold to their faith, since their perseverance proves the efficacy of the God who supports them.

However, this is usually insufficient for most people.

- The *real* question they're asking is [how God's will applies to *their* decision-making](people-decisions-christian.md).
