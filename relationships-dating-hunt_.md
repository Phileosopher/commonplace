## Hunt everywhere

Even if you're attractive and [successful](success-1_why.md), the most likely candidates for a relationship haven't met you yet, so keep meeting new people.

When dating, you're essentially "[selling](marketing.md)" yourself:

- Successful dating is a bit of both sales and marketing:
  - A complete slob won't get a date after 1,000 tries.
  - An attractive, successful person who doesn't meet new people will probably never find a mate.
- Sales requires increasing the chances of an unlikely thing happening.
  - The most obvious way to improve chances is to increase your events:
    1. If you go to one new venue every week, you've visited about 50 places in a year.
    2. At each venue, it's likely you'll find 5 new people you find attractive, which is 250 people a year.
    3. 100 people will already be in a relationship.
    4. 100 of them won't find you attractive.
    5. Of the remaining 50, 20-40 won't meet your standards, and you'll find 10 possible candidates you can get to know more.
- [Marketing](marketing.md) is conveying your value at each event by improving how you appear:
  - Learn better [social](people-4_friends.md) and [speaking](language-speaking.md) skills.
  - Find way to at least *appear* [successful](success-1_why.md) and [happy](mind-feelings-happiness.md).
  - [Lose weight](body-2_diet.md) and learn to [have fun](fun.md).

Search *everywhere* for a date:

- Ask family and friends.
- Pursue group events for the things you enjoy and [find new friends](people-4_friends.md).
- Invite people to your home.
- Visit an official dating event or a dating website.

Dating website tips:

- In general, most dating websites are a worthless [social media](networks-social.md), so focus more of your effort on in-person encounters.
- Use a good photo that captures your personality.
  - Since they're dating you and not your friends, don't use group photos.
  - Unless you're looking for a one-night stand, don't show anything sexually suggestive.
  - Pay a professional photographer to capture your best physical qualities.
- Avoid standard greetings like "hey, how are you?"
  - Bring up a shared interest right away.
  - Tell them a funny observation about their profile.
  - Generally, the more attractive they are the more people are contacting them, so stay [tactful](people-3_respect.md).
- Try to fill your profile and bio with keywords that match the things you value.

The more you think about asking someone out, the less likely you'll actually do it, so take the risk quickly and often.

## Set realistic expectations

After a few dates, you should have a prioritized list of everything you want in a partner:

- While feelings will waver, guidelines don't.
- Write out your list, and keep consulting it to keep yourself accountable.
- As you date, it's not uncommon for your standards to change when you gain increased [awareness](awareness.md) of who you are and what you want.

If you let past experiences unrelated to them affect your judgment, you're being irrational and unfair to them.

Nobody is perfect, so don't expect it:

- Instead, prioritize your desires to see how many of the things you want, and how important they are to you.
- No human, no matter how beautiful, attractive, or loving, [can give someone satisfaction in life](mind-feelings-happiness.md).
  - You can only love anyone as much as you love yourself.
- Respect people for who they *are*, not what they could be or what you want them to be.

To succeed through all the effort and unlikely circumstances, you *must* [find a way to persevere](success-4_routine.md) irrespective of what happens.

## If you're not finding anyone

Deeply ask yourself why you can't seem to find anyone:

- Ask friends for their sincere input.
- Maybe *you're* the one with the above-stated warning signs!
- If you feel helpless without a partner, you're in a better place than feeling helpless *with* a partner.

Are you exposing yourself to enough people?

- Learn to connect with more people and [make more friends](people-4_friends.md).

Are you doing something unattractive?

- Focus on first impressions.
  - For example, 80% of a woman's first impression comes from whether a man is slouching.
- [Clean and groom yourself more](people-2_image.md).
  - Depending on the context, either smelling nice or body odor is extremely attractive.
  - If you're male, grow facial hair.
- Learn to be more charming and [gracious](people-3_respect.md).
  - Make more direct eye contact.
  - Smile more often.
  - Find more similarities with others.
  - Sharing walking pace with others.
- Try to appear more attractive.
  - Stand tall or try to look tall.
  - [Get a pet](fun-pets.md) or play a musical instrument.
  - The most attractive color to wear is black for men and bright red for women.
  - People are often *very* attracted to someone who looks like their opposite-gender parent.

Watch for people who "friend-zone" you:

- A friend-zone is someone who doesn't share interest in you, but they still wants you around.
- Women friend-zone more often than men.
- You shouldn't need to earn someone's affection, and are worth more than that.
- Avoid spending much time with them, since they're effectively using you.
  - Ask them about connecting you with one of their friends.
    - If they don't like you, they'll oblige.
    - If they like you, they'll change their mind out of jealousy.
- Sometimes you'll feel like a person is cycling between interested and disinterested.
  - They are either playing mind games or don't know what they want.
