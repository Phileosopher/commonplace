# Success defined

The how-to industry often defines *how* to succeed, but rarely *what* success is.

Most "success porn" presumes succeeding is a universal constant.

In reality, success is as variable as [human purpose](purpose.md).

## Success is a matter of perspective

In some ways, success is difficult to define:

- [Earl Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Nightingale) called success "a progressive realization of a worthy ideal".
- [Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/) defined it as "having a ton of pleasure and very little pain".
- [Zig Ziglar](https://www.ziglar.com/) called it "the greatest usage of your ability".
- [John Wooden](http://www.coachwooden.com/) described success as "peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your very best".
- [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://fooledbyrandomness.com/) defined success as simply "leading an honorable life".
- No matter how, success always involves achieving, overcoming a problem, and finding [meaning](meaning.md) and [purpose](purpose.md) that [affects others](power-influence.md).

However, each culture values different things:

- The USA values a fulfilling [career](jobs-1_why.md) and [family](people-family.md).
- Europe values health and [satisfaction with life](mind-feelings-happiness.md).
- Latin America values [education](understanding.md).
- Saudi Arabia, Nepal, Ukraine, and some African countries measure success with [money](money-1_why.md).
- Wealthy nations often find it in safety and [housing](home-buysell.md).
- A handful of countries, like Australia, value work-life balance.
- Bhutan and Zimbabwe determine success through [community involvement](groups-member.md).
- Medieval Italians believed success was [calmly hiding the severity of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura).

We have various ways to measure success:

- Defined by how we feel about our accomplishments.
- Defined by others' interpretations of what we've done.
- We frequently measure others' success by how effortless something appears to be to them.
- Successful people typically define their success by adhering to predetermined values.

To start defining success for *yourself*, start with something simple:

- Failing slightly less disastrously
- Mastering something simple
- Becoming familiar with something
- Trying something that makes you a little uncomfortable

## Don't measure success by status

Success is more of a daily grind of good decisions than any specific, measurable thing.

Ignore the number of friends you have:

- Each person can only logistically maintain 150--300 [relationships](people-4_friends.md) in a year.
- Maintaining a crowd of friends is expensive and time-consuming.
- We find [meaning](meaning.md) in the *depth* of individual friendships, not in many of them.

Beyond your plans, ignore how much money you have:

- [Money is a store and measurement of power](money-1_why.md), not competence or personal value.
- Many of the most innovative and successful people in the world make very little money.

Don't obsess about your fame, recognition, and reputation:

- Living the way others expect will make you very miserable long-term.
- Fame and reputation are fickle and depend heavily on how people feel about your publicly shared values.
- Famous people often suffer from a *complete* lack of privacy, which makes it very difficult for them to find [happiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md).
- A reputation *is* a very useful [insurance policy](insurance.md) against public defamation, but it requires *lots* of maintenance and doesn't have intrinsic value.

Your intelligence and knowledge aren't that important:

- Stupid mistakes come more from conceit than unintelligence.
- Possessing knowledge isn't as useful as having wisdom or skill.
- [Understanding](understanding.md) comes through so many ranges that you're not guaranteed to easily articulate it to others.

You have no clear picture of "balance":

- Balance is always relative to two extremes, and varies widely between your culture and personal experience.
- It's impossible to attain something you can't easily define.
- [Unresolved trauma](hardship-ptsd.md) usually inspires people to misinterpret the center of the extremes.

Happiness is a terrible measurement of success:

- We find [happiness](mind-feelings-happiness.md) in the absence of desire, which has no bearing on our environment.
- Depending on its scope, dissatisfaction is often a *requirement* to pursue success.

Don't compare yourself to others:

- Each person has a different [personality](personality.md), so one person's success may simply be competence for someone else.
- More specifically, a person is a success proportionally to how much they employ their conscientiousness: a low-conscientiousness person is doing well if they can hold down a [career](jobs-1_why.md) and [children](parenting-1_babies.md), while a hyper-conscientious person is only a success if they positively [change their community](mgmt-1_why.md).
- Most of the successful people are a unique kind of stubborn, where they disregard at least some of [society's trends](trends.md) while pursuing a noble goal.

## The best success is internal

Everything in the physical world changes, decays, and [becomes obsolete](trends.md).

Most things that feel immovable are dangerously fragile (e.g., [our bodies](body-1_why.md), [relationships](relationships-1_why.md), [large organizations](groups-large.md)).

The most long-lasting success involves self-discipline:

- Self-discipline gives us competence for future successes, and doesn't fade much over time.
- Self-discipline comes through [habits](habits.md) directed toward virtues.
- Over time, successful people also learn to respect information they can only learn from experience.
- As we grow, we expand ourselves to create [traditions](people-culture.md) and [legacies](legacy.md).

Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman defined an array of universal character strengths and virtues:

- Creativity: creates things from observations
- Curiosity: desires to see beyond the conventional
- Open-mindedness: willing to see things from a different angle
- Love of learning: interested in finding new truths
- Perspective and wisdom: applies knowledge and experience into daily life
- Bravery: stands against opposition
- Persistence: maintains a purpose with no outside support
- Integrity: doesn't compromise values
- Vitality: approaches life with excitement and energy
- Love: connects intimately with others
- Kindness: tends to do favors and good deeds
- Social intelligence: aware of motives and feelings in oneself and others
- Teamwork: works well alongside others
- Fairness: treats others without bias
- Leadership: encourages peers and subordinates to perform well
- Forgiveness: reconciles and releases
- Humility & Modesty: lets accomplishments speak for themselves
- Prudence: makes choices carefully
- Self-Regulation: restraint from excess
- Appreciates Beauty & Excellence: regards the innate glory of nature
- Gratitude: aware and grateful for good things
- Hope: expects the best and works toward it
- Humor: sees how things have a less serious perspective
- Spirituality: possesses a higher purpose beyond this life

For most of us, our success will start with smaller goals:

- Plan for the future
  - Get a [retirement fund](money-investing.md)
  - Become [healthy](body-4_health.md)
  - Get a [career plan](jobs-1_why.md)

  - Enjoy uncomfortable things
  - Read every day
  - Routinely turn off electronic devices
  - Finish projects you started

## Success is a cycle

In another way, success is the constant continuation of a very specific cycle:

1. Inspiration: find either an unsolved problem or an idea that could solve a problem
2. Brainstorm: learn [how to solve that problem](mind-creativity.md) and [mentally prepare](success-2_attitude.md)
3. Plan: make [long- and short-term goals](success-3_goals.md) to get there
4. Setup: get in position to start the plan
5. Attempt: do the best you think you can based on your [attitude](addiction-centers.md)
6. Failure: natural setbacks from unpreparedness, naïveté, and nature
7. Recovery: accepting reality and reconciling discouragement
8. Repetition: repeating steps 2-7, often while [optimizing](success-4_routine.md) each time
9. Success: the fruit of repeating steps 2-8 persistently

Before we can start looking at changes, though, we need [the correct attitude](success-2_attitude.md).
