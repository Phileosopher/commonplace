Contradictions

	Our modern society has a hard time wrapping our minds around certain “perspective issues” with the Bible. We have so much recorded video, audio recordings, transcriptions, sensor readings, computer logs, phone records, and insurance documentation that we subconsciously presume its presence when we examine the lens of history. It can be discreditable or infuriating when we move back in time to an era where the most reliable measure of the seasons were temple priests and the most accurate source of tax documentation came from the individual organizational skills of the modern-day equivalent of a repo man. Add in the fact that literacy was a niche skill for the political and geekier part of the population, and we don’t have much to go on.

	With that said, the Gospels do have some so-called  “contradictions” that do need clearing up. While they’re relatively benign, I can see it creating a crisis of faith in a newer believer if not properly addressed. Very often, they have mundane explanations:

    • Many times, Jesus will tell a parable or story, and it might have different details or placed differently in the story’s narrative. It’s only natural that he said these things dozens of times (like all teachers do). Like all human beings, they would have iterated in different forms. For the sake of simplicity, I grouped them together where they correspond to events that happened, since some of the accounts give Jesus’ stories without the context for why they arose, but they are often likely not the same event.
    • When there’s a differing chronology of events, it really depends on the writer’s narrative ordering. Luke and John were designed to be chronological, while Matthew expressed his story based on themes, and Mark was somewhere in between Matthew and Luke. John also makes things complicated by covering details that nobody else did, probably because he was a kid at the time and had a more personal experience with Jesus (“the disciple whom Jesus loved”). I preserved the chronology in the general order of Luke > John > Mark > Matthew, but I don’t know if the narrative order is as necessarily important as the legitimacy of the events themselves. I did make one concession for Pilate’s trial with John, since that event would have hard-coded it onto his memory as PTSD from him being a boy at the time.
    • When accounts differ while Jesus is in a crowd (which is rather frequent), there is a lot of chaos that no single account would be able to capture. This makes sense if someone is creating controversy by doing miracles while his religion’s leaders are trying to discredit him through public debate. When Jesus’ exact words differ, it makes complete sense that a gently-speaking person in a crowd, even with authority, will be misheard.
    • Another thematic pattern of error involves multiple events being concatenated into one simply by their similarity. There were actually two women who broke an alabaster jar open and anointed Jesus, both with people standing by wondering about it, and both with Jesus giving a veiled rebuke. Jesus cursed a barren fig tree twice as well, both ways between Bethany and Jerusalem.
    • Jesus was absurdly busy for a man in his time. For example, 
    • Were there 2 demon-possessed men at the Gadarenes or 1? I’m fairly certain that if you’re in the middle of a crowd and there’s an echo in a valley, a crazy demon-possessed man will sound like 2 people and you won’t be able to see.
    • Were there 2 blind men healed or 1? Mark and Luke didn’t see it, but only heard it, while Matthew did see it.
    • Was Jesus’ robe purple or red? That depends if you have tritanopia color-blindness.
    • Were there 2 angels or 1 at the empty tomb? There were 2, but only John heard about the second one. Plus, as an added bonus, there was a misunderstanding from how the believers the angels’ message, and they first thought it was a corpse theft before they were corrected.
    • There are others, but most of the debate at this point comes from which way your bias leans while walking into reading it. If you’re trying to find a way that it didn’t happen, you’ll find one.

	For many of the above, most of the fallibility of these eyewitness accounts do prove (at least to me) that later collusion by these relatively uneducated Roman peasant citizens is very unlikely. It’s more likely that these events happened as the people recorded them.

	It’s also much more impressive that this ancient set of documents was so reliably and accurately reproduced across the entire known world. With the exception of the Greek majority and minority text differences (which are all relatively minor differences), these accounts are more reliable than what actually happened a few short centuries later to unseat the entirety of the Roman Empire.
Spirit vs. Letter
	While I may wax theological here, I do want to dispel a certain myth that comes with being relatively new to Christianity.


## HINDUISM

DHARMA – Living according to our inner purpose
ARTHA – Establishing goals and values that promote it
KAMA – Finding happiness in what we do based upon our Dharma
MOKSHA – Gaining the freedom of consciousness

the basis starts with dharma, when it should be moksha
- however, moksha can't be self-determined, and must be instilled
- then, kama is derived from the moksha from God
- THEN, and only then, comes dharma and artha
