#### modern culture - old TLS essay

We have had near-unlimited freedoms as Christians for a few hundred years now in the West. It hasn't gotten us as far into our exploration of a Christian society as some of the USA's Founders would have hoped for if they weren't discovering life after this one firsthand.

To date, the Protestants have replaced the formal political power structure with a pastor/shepherd role and kept the relatively rigid hierarchy inspired from Judaism. This doesn't represent the relative egalitarianism that defined the early Christian Church.

They also never acknowledged that all believers are technically priests of the Lord, probably because of their [PTSD](https://gainedin.site/ptsd/) of what the Catholics did with the concept. This idea has never been amended.

I'm convinced Protestants haven't gone far enough. The system is still far more bloated than the pure simplicity of Christ-centered leadership. We are called to love one another, irrespective of social status, and reputational status inside the Church has turned it into a game of politics. While the Reformation stripped much of the power from the fully-central authority (i.e., Vatican City), they never decentralized the authority inside each church.

Ironically, this isn't _entirely_ a bankrupt system. Even in a church with very few traditions, the public Assembly service is often renamed the "church service", while the Thanksgiving service is an informal fellowship of Christians following that service at a local lunch place or coffee shop. It's missing the Eucharist, but is still loving believers spending spiritually-minded time together, and it's hard to imagine that [God wouldn't be okay with it](https://icould.fail/trend/).

The knee-jerk reaction I've heard countless times, though, is "Well, that's not _my_ church. Ours is…
- Spirit-filled
- Doing good works in the community
- Has the right theology
- Is practicing social justice

It may, and I'm not saying that it's not, though I expect [in-group bias](https://gainedin.site/groups-member/) over it. I'd be more inclined to believe it if you spoke well of _other_ churches outside your denomination:

- While I find Third-Wave Pentecostalism theologically shallow, they're often capturing the sentiment of Christian love and [narrativizing](https://gainedin.site/stories/) the power of God very well.
- Southern Baptists have very accurate theological foundations, often with very little works to show for it.
- Calvary Chapel has some of the best [evangelism](https://icould.fail/evangelism/) I've ever seen, even if their discipleship is weak.
- Roman Catholics often understand the importance of spiritual [disciplines](https://gainedin.site/habits/) more than many Protestants, even if they're bogged down by unnecessary tradition.
- Eastern Orthodox are more apt than most denominations to understand the interconnectedness of the universe and God, even while many elements of their value systems are bound without [understanding](https://gainedin.site/understanding/) and solely through [tradition](https://gainedin.site/culture/).

I'm simply saying there's something wrong with the organizational structure, which bleeds down into the rest of the Church's culture. When the business world's management hierarchy is becoming more horizontal than the Church's, or the homosexual community has more solidarity than the Church, this is a sign of horrific sickness, since Christians are supposed to lead the way on [how to run society correctly](https://icould.fail/millennium/).

The Catholic church Latinized the Bible, then made the mistake of not translating it as the language changed, meaning that an accessibility-improving measure became a constraint centuries later. Isn't this the same issue with the culture of Protestantism five centuries later?

I'm not saying to abolish all traditions. I've been around churches that completely abolish _all_ ritual or precept after seeing issues in the Church. While they often capture the intimacy and closeness of being part of the family of God, they easily and quickly devolve into more emotionalist and romanticized elements that veer into heresy, such as accepting prophetic visions or other historical documents on the level of Scripture.

I'm simply making an appeal to taking the long-standing traditions more seriously, and adapt them or remove them. In that sense, the Catholics have been doing remarkable work changing, even if I don't agree with _where_ they're going with their ways. Like any other [creation](https://gainedin.site/creations/) or [habit](https://gainedin.site/habits/), every Protestant tradition is a commentary on Catholicism, which is a commentary on either early Christianity or post-exile Judaism, and both are commentaries on pre-exile Judaism.

In this story of the past, we must find where the thread started unraveling. My personal belief is that we've entered a Dark Age of Christianity that started 1700 years ago when Christians gained political power. The most evident portion of this, in my opinion, is that the beauty and variety that comes through the wide spectrum of every nation, tribe, people, and language is funneled into a rigid set of dull, dead social mores, destined to reproduce through a leadership that fears minor unapproved changes.

All I want to see is that variety make its way into the Church, since those are the building blocks that the Holy Spirit will productively build Christianity.

Thus, I propose the following precepts that the Church should probably do to be less wrong, since churches won't get it right until [Jesus comes back](https://icould.fail/jesus-returns/):

1. Get rid of the clergy/laity dichotomy. All Christians are the New Priesthood of Christ, with Him being High Priest of everyone. All you have are different levels of experience/wisdom, which eventually go away as new believers grow.
2. Lower the requirements for laity to serve. If they can do the job, and are morally upright, you don't have to like them. We're called to love the unlovable for _our_ spiritual benefit, and not simply for their emotional/physical advantage.
3. Don't let arguments among believers persist. This is the number one cause for denominations, which is _literally_ anti-Christ in motivation, since [the Lord hates rebellion as much as witchcraft](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1sa.15.23).
4. Bring back a demarcation between "believer" and "outsider" service, based strictly on baptism. You don't need to be formalized about it or keep records, since a "Christian" who lies about whether they were baptized will show their fruits later.
5. Get rid of "membership", which is a bureaucratic system that echoes of Catholicism. Just have that new attender give their testimony that day, have everyone vote on whether they're legit, and be done with it.
6. Have a proper ejection process for heretics and [conflicts](https://adequate.life/conflicts/). [Matthew 18](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.18) has a good one: confront them privately, then drag a few mutual friends along, then bring it in front of a spiritual leader, then treat them as an outsider.
7. Get rid of the architectural associations to the clergy/laity. Jewish synagogues didn't have anything so heavily defined or lavishly decorated.
8. Get off the political bandwagon. If you live in a republic/democratic State, you get one stupid vote unless you administrate something. Go vote, tell people what you voted for or what they should vote for, and shut up about anything that divides the Body on that matter. A society in Christ is motivated with [the zeal of capitalism mixed with the intentions of communism](https://icould.fail/millennium/), so we worship a God with an unprecedented, absolutely alien polity that won't emerge until [He does](https://icould.fail/jesus-returns/).
