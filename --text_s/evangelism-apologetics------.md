Bible Defenses
--------------

There are quite a few "contradictions" stated in the Bible, though many of them are simply contradictions at face value.

-   Often, there is *tremendous* wisdom in finding how those two verses are *not* contradictions.
-   Emphasis added below to easily indicate the allegations.

The Sabbath Day

-   **Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy**. - [Exodus 20:8](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm)
-   One person considers one day more sacred than another; **another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind**. - [Romans 14:5](https://biblehub.com/romans/14-5.htm)
-   Within context, "every day alike" means that *every* day is being regarded as holy, not *just* the Sabbath day.

The Earth's Permanence

-   Generations come and generations go, but **the earth remains forever.** - [Ecclesiastes 1:4](https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm)
-   But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. **The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire**, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare. - [2 Peter 3:10](https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm)
-   There's a specific perspective to be addressed here: Ecclesiastes is part of the group called "wisdom books", which are intentionally poetic.
    -   It's very easy to see the imagery, and the earth *absolutely* outlives each of us and even [our legacies](https://gainedin.site/legacy/).
    -   By contrast, Peter's letter to the Church is very explicitly describing what *will* happen, without any uncertainty.
    -   In fact, the concept goes farther to refute the ideas of the time of the New Testament, specifically Greek atomism (that the universe's atoms were effectively immortal).

Seeing God

-   So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because **I saw God face to face**, and yet my life was spared." - [Genesis 32:30](https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-30.htm)
-   **No one has ever seen God**, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known. - [John 1:18](https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm)
-   We have to clearly define the word "seen", [more on the idea at GotQuestions here](https://www.gotquestions.org/seen-God.html).

Human Sacrifice

-   **Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed** to Molek, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD. - [Leviticus 18:21](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm)
-   Jephthah made this vow to the LORD: "If indeed You will deliver the Ammonites into my hand, then **whatever comes out the door of my house to greet me on my triumphant return** from the Ammonites will belong to the LORD, and **I will offer it up as a burnt offering**." - [Judges 11:30-31](https://biblehub.com/judges/11.htm)
-   This is a clear distinction between what God *wants* versus what man *gives*.
    -   Jephthah made a severe mistake by offering up "whatever" comes from his house to greet him, not really thinking through the consequence.
    -   This is more an example of the kinds of foolishness we can fall into when we get excited than anything else.
    -   Reading further, he followed through on his word against all convention, and he was regarded as *faithful* for that second decision in [Hebrews 11:32](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-32.htm), which holds a separate standard than the first decision he made through giving a promise.
