Talent on demand rather than having to pay for employees all the time, whether you need them or not.

You are hiring an independent contractor who is an expert at what they do (rather than a jack of all trades).

Make sure you hire specialists and avoid those that offer many different types of services.

List several projects that, if completed, would make a big impact on your business.

Legal resources who specialize in filing trademarks.

Virtual Support Organizations (VSO) provide ongoing support like an employee, but from a distance.

Financial management : use online accounting systems (quickbooks.com) so a virtual CFO can remotely manage and keep me up-to-date on every aspect of my company's financial health.

Do not make the mistake of dumping more and broader scope of work on them, as time goes on.

DO
- value the relationship
- see your VA as an equal partner
- articulate your needs and wants well
- maintain a trusting relationship
- stay centered, focused, and organized so as not to distract your VA

DON'T
- fail to communicate when they request something from you
- attempt to micromanage
- treat your VA like a low-level employee
- live in the urgent, where everything is last-minute

Important to have a written business process for each support function a VA does for you. This discipline will quickly disappear into a mist of good intentions as soon as you try to broaden the scope of your VAs.

COO : Must have extensive experience assisting businesses from the strategic, operational, and HR perspectives.

Start with the small steps of hiring VAs for specific, measurable tasks. After you have two or more working with you and everything is going smoothly, consider hiring an executive level VA to grow your virtual team beyond that point.

If your VA team interacts with your prospects, customers, or suppliers, have them use your email signature (with their name not yours).

## a scouting - sivers - Hiring Smart - by Pierre Mornell - 1 before

Before the initial interview, pick up the phone and call the candidate.

How hard or easy is it to reach the candidate? Does the candidate return your call at the specific times that you suggest?

I review time, place, and dress for the initial interview by phone.

Five to 10 percent of interviewees will screw up this first test.

Regardless of the material already in your file, ask the candidate to send a resume with a one-page cover letter that briefly highlights his or her life and background.

Is the response slow or prompt? How long before the letter and resume arrive by mail or fax? Is the candidate literate or illiterate? Sloppy or neat?

65 percent of executive candidates lie about their academic credentials. Forty-three percent lie about their job responsibilities. Forty-two percent lie about previous compensation.

A resume must always be verified.

It is a red light if a person behaves deceptively on something as basic as a resume.

Ask the candidate to visit one of your stores, plants, campuses, offices, or Web page before the interview. Then ask for the candidate's observations.

Most candidates wait for the beginning of the "official" interview like a runner waits for the starter's gun to fire. These few minutes are a terrific opportunity to take a brief stroll about the office and make small talk, while lowering anxieties. "How was your drive? Any trouble finding the office? Would you like some coffee?" Look for curiosity - does the candidate ask questions? What other behavior does the candidate exhibit?

Curiosity is a valuable asset in an employee. It demonstrates a desire to gratify the mind with new discoveries, to learn about novel and extraordinary things.

Read the top candidates' resumes in teams of three to five people. Watch for one of your team members to emerge, often unpredictably, as your in-house resume expert.

Let a wide range of people know that you're looking.

What Dave observed at the dinner party and hotel were the potential candidates' behaviors. Casting the widest net possible, he is always on the lookout for the best candidates available,

Microsoft assumes that the best candidates are not looking for new jobs. In fact, candidates who approach Microsoft are actually less attractive to the company.

Hiring people from big companies to little companies, top-down to bottom-up organizations, or structured to entrepreneurial settings, can be a dangerous route.

Before interviewing new candidates for old jobs, it's an excellent time to rethink the job itself.

Keep your initial interview short.

## avoiding group think

Team dysfunction often derives from group-think
- Group-think is the tendency to not think individually and personally on apparent issues and challenges which face the group
1. Members misjudge their standards as higher than reality and that they can't fail
2. They rationalize everything to discredit legitimate warnings or negative feedback
3. Everyone pressures each other to stay quiet about any complaints or negative consequences

Group-think creates many negative results
• Higher peer pressure against positive changes
• State of complacency about group tasks
• Highly censored opinions everyone publicly conforms to
• Illusions about unanimous agreement on a decision
