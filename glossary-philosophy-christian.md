# Christianity's compatibility with philosophy

This is a breakdown of [my philosophy glossary](glossary-philosophy.md), focused on indicating what is possible to be true in light of Christianity. It would be helpful to place that one next to this one as you read.

The angle here is to assume that all things are possible, unless there's a materially significant conflict with Christian doctrine.

- If God's desire is to draw people from all walks of life, then that will encompass all forms of philosophy, so it would be close-minded to assume more specific values than what is legitimately possible.
- It is reasonable to assume, however, that any population of mature Christians will invariably develop a narrower scope of belief over time.

This is, therefore, less of a clear picture of what *is* correct, and more of a clear image of what *can* be believed within the legitimate body of Christ.

- Anything "True" is literally essential to being a Christian.
- Absolutely *anything* "Possible" can coexist with the Christian faith (especially when they're [new believers](christian-new.md)), though some of them can legitimately damage a person's relationship with God (even if it doesn't outright destroy it).
- Anything "False" is literally impossible to harmonize with the Christian faith.

## Metaphysics: How many parts is reality made of?

Since we are distinctly *not* God, but God has distinctly made the universe and everything in it, then all Christian metaphysics must necessarily be **dualism** across reality (except moral dualism, since Christians define [immorality](morality.md) as the *absence* of good).

- **Cartesianism/Substance dualism** can't exist strictly, since there are enough Bible verses to indicate that the [a person](humanity.md) is composed of the collective whole that incorporates *both* their mind and body (e.g., flesh/spirit battle expressed in [Romans 7:15](https://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm)).
- **Epiphenomenalism** isn't possible, since the very universe itself was corrupted by our severed ties between us and God (which is arguably a mental experience more than a physical one).
- **Mentalism** is, by Christian theology, necessarily true, since at least some part of our minds are part of our souls, which live on past this life while our brains will decay with the rest of our bodies.
- **Realism** is also necessarily true, at least regarding *our* perspective. However, if we argue that God's perspective is what holds the universe together, then **acosmism** is true according to God's perspective, and realism would therefore be incorrect.
  - Given that our hearts are thoroughly deceitful, and that we shouldn't lean on our understanding, **Na√Øve/Direct/Perceptual/Common-sense realism** (*and* its polar opposite **sensualism**) can't be true.

However, **monism** and **pluralism** could certainly exist *within* the universe as a subset of dualism.

- Monism evokes many [feelings](mind-feelings.md) to associate everything with everything else.
  - **Dynamism** is certainly possible if the connections between matter are inseparable from matter itself (e.g., quantum superstates).
  - **Idealism** is entirely possible, especially if we define the universe as something created for a relationship with God.
    - **German idealism** is possible to believe if we assume our minds develop a type of "commentary" on what we perceive.
    - **Objective idealism** is possible, but only if we assert that the perception of God defines what exists. Some theologies of hell, however, make this impossible (since it'd be God's non-perception).
    - **Subjective idealism** can't be true, since our minds and God's mind are intrinsically separate things that certainly both exist.
  - **Materialism** (and its derivatives in **dialectical materialism**, **historical materialism**, **naturalism**, and **physicalism**) isn't possible in Christian doctrine, since there is a *lot* of Scripture revolving around the concept of a "spirit" state that transcends a physical one.
    - In particular, **Christian materialism**, despite its name, requires indicating that only Jesus exists, and we are illusions, which takes away from any meaningful relationship God would have with us.
    - Physicalism's variants (**eliminative materialism**, **emergent materialism**, **French materialism**, **reductionism**, and **revisionary mateirialism**) are abiding by [science's](science.md) latest [trends](trends.md), but don't hold up if we assume that God is a spirit being of any form.
- Pluralism is also entirely possible if we believe that some things are designed to transcend [human understanding](understanding.md).
  - **Holism** and **organicism** has plenty of use. An example would be how the Church with all its members together is more value than each individual within the Church.
  - At the same time, **reductionism** (and **ontological reductionism**) is also significant in its place. After all, as a [thought experiment](paradoxes.md), Jesus would still have died for one single human being.

### The verdict on reality's parts

True

- Dualism
  - Mentalism

Possible (and useful)

- Pluralism (if some things are designed to transcend human understanding)
  - Holism
  - Organicism
  - Reductionism
    - Ontological reductionism

Possible (somewhat)

- Acosmism (if God's perspective holds the universe together)
- Realism (likely)
- Monism (as a subset)
  - Dynamism (if matter and its connections are inseparable)
  - Idealism (if we conclude the universe was created for a relationship with God)
    - German idealism (since our perceptions are a "commentary" on what exists)
    - Objective idealism (if we assert that God defines what exists)

False

- Some forms of dualism
  - Substance dualism
  - Epiphenomenalism
  - Common-sense realism
  - Sensualism
- Monism (as a superset)
  - Subjective idealism
  - Materialism (and *all* subsets)

## Metaphysics: Does reality exist?

There is no way that God's standard of justice is relative, so **absolutism** is undeniably true and **relativism** is undeniably false.

- Further, our beliefs about [God's omniscience](god.md) almost mandate a further belief in **necessitarianism** (since God doesn't technically perceive "possibility", even though we do).

The very real nature of [sin](morality-sins.md) and our implicit need for a Savior makes severe constraints on reality:

- **Accidentalism** isn't possible, since cause-and-effect is a very real thing.
- **Nominalism** can't be true because the truth of sin requires there to be an objective reality associated with a moral failing.
  - However, **conceptualism** is still possible, especially if we lean into idealism.
- **Illusionism** can't be true, since God creates actual, tangible things.
- **Immaterialism** can't be true either, since there are material, real consequences that we face as a consequence of material, real [decisions](people-decisions.md) we have made.

**Eternalism** is certainly *partly* true, at least with reference to God. Our beliefs about what God knows and how long He has known it will affect how far it goes.

**Philosophical presentism** also has a tremendous amount of possibility, since the past is simply [memories](understanding.md) and the future is simply [imagination](imagination.md).

### The Verdict

True

- Absolutism

Possible (and useful)

- Eternalism (with respect to God)
- Philosophical presentism

Possible (somewhat)

- Conceptualism

False

- Accidentalism
- Nominalism
- Illusionism
- Immaterialism

## Metaphysics: What is reality made of?

**Anti-realism** is necessarily true in some part, since God knows what we don't, and we can't fully know God's plans.

- **Modal realism** is also at least somewhat true, given how much value God gives regarding keeping our minds and hearts pure.

**Atomism** is hard to *not* be true, since God has a cumulative design structure that uses many small things to make bigger things (e.g., protons/neutrons/electrons for all matter, neurons for all brains).

- The extremes, though, of **Buddhist atomism** and **Greek atomism** can't be true, since there's a clearly sustaining nature to atoms, but they were certainly created by God at some time in the past and will some time in the future cease to exist.

**Constructivism** certainly has merit, since our minds have constraints on what we can perceive.

**Determinism** is necessarily true in some way, since God has designed everything and knows what will happen.

- **Hereditarianism** is very possible, and likely true, especially when we consider that Scripture indicates aspects such as curses passing across generations ([Exodus 34:7](https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm)).
- **Finalism** is, in some ways, a vastly [meaningful](meaning.md) perspective within Christianity, since [Jesus will eventually create a right solution](jesus-returns.md) to all failings within society.
- However, subsets of determinism like **biologism**, **historical determinism**, and **historicism** can't be true, since our decisions are inalienably our responsibility and God is always capable of intervening to change the course of events.
- On a smaller scale, though, **indeterminism** is also possible, since misfortune happens evenly to both righteous and sinners ([Matthew 5:45](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm)).

**Emanationism** is a necessary Christian principle, since God literally made *everything* in the first place.

- While **occasionalism** can exist, it can't be complete because we would then have to conclude that God caused us to sin, which is *not* true ([James 1:13](https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm)).
- **Ontologism** is also entirely possible within Christian theology, and there is Scripture to back it ([Romans 1:20](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm)).

**Essentialism** is entirely possible, but only if we believe beyond a certain amount of [order](values.md).

**Hylozoism** is *potentially* possible, but it's a stretch. It would require defining souls as physical things (and not merely spiritual).

- However, **vitalism** has a high likelihood to be true, since our souls aren't a [scientifically measurable](science.md) thing.
- **Panpsychism** may have truth, depending how it's defined and what we qualify as having a "mind".

**Physicalism** and **mechanism** can't be true, since God is spirit ([John 4:24](https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm)).

**Intrinsicism** can sit alongside Christian theology, especially since we were thoughts of God before we became physical beings ([Psalm 139:13-16](https://biblehub.com/psalms/139.htm)).

- Even **Platonism** is possible if we assume that the forms of the universe are contained within God's mind, though there can't be any "goodness" inherent to the forms relative to their physical expressions.

**Optimism** is the only reliable Christian way to see this universe (e.g., [Liebniz' "best of all possible worlds"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds)), and necessitates that **pessimism** can't be true in any grand scope.

**Voluntarism** is profoundly true if we believe God literally *designed* the universe for our relationship with Him (which places our wills into a higher value than we'd otherwise imagine).

### The verdict on reality's composition

True

- Determinism
  - Hereditarianism
  - Finalism
- Emanationism

Possible (and useful)

- Atomism (since God designed everything from smaller components)
- Anti-realism (since God has hidden plans)
  - Modal realism (since God cares so much about how we see things in our minds)
- Constructivism (since our minds have constraints on what we can perceive)
- Essentialism
- Indeterminism (at a small scale)
- Intrinsicism (since we were God's "thoughts" first)
- Ontologism
- Optimism (in general)

Possible (somewhat)

- Platonism (if the "form" isn't inherently superior to the form's reflection)
- Vitalism (since our souls aren't scientifically measurable)
- Voluntarism (if our wills are the reason for the universe's existence)

Possible (but difficult)

- Hylozoism
- Panpsychism
- Pessimism (on a small scale)

False

- Atomism (at its extremes)
  - Buddhist atomism
  - Greek atomism
- Determinism (in some forms)
  - Biologism
  - Historical determinism
  - Historicism
- Occasionalism
- Physicalism
  - Mechanism

## Metaphysics: Who runs reality?

**Animism** can be entirely true, but any spiritual authority will be subordinate to God's authority.

While anti-theism is somewhat true, **nontheism** simply can't be true if Christianity holds truth.

- **Agnosticism** (and its subsets, and the hybrid of **transtheism**) are untrue, since the God of the Bible is *certainly* knowable with distinctive qualities.
- **Atheism** (and its subsets) are untrue, since there obviously *is* a God.
- Further, hybrids and derivatives like **Agnostic atheism** and **Ignosticism** can't be true either.
- While it isn't direct, **Darwinism** is very difficult to harmonize with Christianity and requires plenty of [symbolic associations](symbols.md) to come to that conclusion.

Christianity is essentially and indisputably a subset of **theism**.

- In particular, it's vastly and non-negotiably **monotheism**.
  - **Augustinianism** is definitely true, since the dichotomy of spiritual and physical does *not* have an implicit goodness or badness (i.e., there are spiritual [demons](spiritual-warfare.md) and angels, there are physical sinners and physical Jesus Christ as sinless).
  - **Classical theism** is at least *somewhat* true, but the essence of Jesus makes it impossible to go all the way with the idea (since He wants a [friendship](people-friends.md) with us and is therefore affected by our lives and [decisions](people-decisions.md) by extension).
  - **Deism** can't be true, since God has a clearly vested interest in humanity's decisions and development.
  - Since God is *clearly* distinct from the universe, **pantheism**, **panentheism**, **pandeism**, **monistic theism** can't be true.
  - **Substance monotheism** is necessary in some form as a necessary basis of understanding the Trinity.
- Christianity also necessitates **creationism**, with the universe being a clear product of God's design.
  - **Young Earth creationism** is the only logical conclusion without incorporating [modern scientific trends](science.md).
    - It's even possible to believe the more radical **Omphalos creationism**.
  - **Theistic evolution** (and its neighbors **Old Earth creationism** and **gap creationism**) requires merging with Darwinism, and is difficult to logically validate.
- While **philosophical theism** is *possible* for a Christian, it's a very shaky ground because it implies that one can find salvation without God's divine revelation (which [simply can't happen by merely observing nature](jesus-gospel.md)).
- **Polytheism** is not true, at least with respect to the universe's creation.
  - However, it *is* possible to fully believe **monolatry** as a Christian, though **henotheism** (and its subset **kathenotheism**) go too far with the idea.
- **Substantialism** is also possible, since God made everything.

### The verdict on reality's manager

True

- Theism (generally)
  - Augustinian theism
  - Substance monotheism
- Creationism

Possible (and useful)

- Creationism (in a few forms)
  - Young Earth creationism (driven by either [scientific beliefs](science.md) or [the Bible](bible.md) directly)
  - Omphalos creationism (which effectively throws out scientific beliefs)

Possible (somewhat)

- Animism (as long as it's subordinate to God's authority)
- Theism (in some forms)
  - Classical theism
- Substantialism (since God made everything)
- Polytheism (by defining "gods" outside of worthiness of worship)
  - Monolatry

Possible (but difficult)

- Darwinism
- Theistic evolution
  - Old Earth creationism
  - Gap creationism
- Philosophical theism

False

- Nontheism
  - Agnosticism
  - Atheism
  - Agnostic atheism
  - Ignosticism
- Deism
- Polytheism (almost entirely)
  - Henotheism
  - Kathenotheism

## Epistemology: What is knowledge?

Since materialism can't be true, **behaviorism** and its subsets are false (with only a few exceptions).

- The implication that God can grant divine revelation means **psychological behaviorism** has some grains of truth.
- **Methodological behaviorism** has truths contained within it, specifically in how we can't [control](power-types.md) what others think and only what they do.
  - Further, there is a *soft* proven reality about **post-Skinnerism** (e.g., the domains of [economics](economics.md) and [political science](politics-systems.md)).

**Rationalism** is a logical consequence of believing a human soul exists, which also means **empiricism** (with **associationism** and **verificationism**) are effectively wrong.

- As a side effect, **positivism** can't be correct either.
- Further, **innatism** is necessary to believe God instills morality into us from the beginning ([Romans 1:20](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm)).

**Presuppositionalism** is necessary to believe God interacts with us through revelation and not simply logic.

Many domains of understanding can work well without any conflict:

- **Conventionalism** can exist, but only to describe *some* human universals.
- **Dialetheism** is entirely possible, since our understanding of the truth may be in error.
- **Ethnocentrism** is at least partly true (including **methodological relativism** and **polylogism**), but there must be a carve-out for divine revelation and the work of the Holy Spirit.
- Both **internalism** and **externalism** are connected to Christian doctrine:
  - There is Scripture that warns against associating with the wrong types of people (i.e., externalism).
  - We are held individually and uncompromisingly responsible for our innermost desires and beliefs, not just our actions (i.e., internalism).
- **Linguistic determinism**, as well as **descriptivism**, can have a Christian basis.
  - However, **linguistic relativism** can't be complete, since that would make the Bible partly irrelevant.
- **Logical atomism** can help us to [understand the primitives](https://trendless.tech/primitives/) that hold up what we believe.
- **Phenomenalism** gives some relativistic view on how we perceive, which can work up to a point.

Both **externism** and **solipsism** (as well as **transcendental idealism** and **Hegelianism**) are possible, but difficult because we're not supposed to lean on our own understanding ([Proverbs 3:5](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-5.htm)).

### The verdict on the essence of knowledge

True

- Rationalism
- Innatism
- Presuppositionalism

Possible (and useful)

- Conventionalism (as long as we don't go all the way with it)
- Dialetheism (since ideas can be complicated)
- Externalism (because our environment defines our thoughts)
- Internalism (because we are morally responsible for our thoughts)
- Logical atomism

Possible (somewhat)

- Ethnocentrism (except for what God can do)
  - Methodological relativism
  - Polylogism
- Linguistic determinism (but not completely)
  - Descriptivism
- Phenomenalism (as long as there is absolute behind it)

Possible (but difficult)

- Behaviorism (on a few points)
  - Psychological behaviorism (since God can grant divine revelation)
  - Methodological behaviorism (since we can't control others' thoughts)
  - Post-Skinnerism (since people are *kindasorta* predictable in large groups)
- Externism
- Solipsism
  - Transcendental idealism
  - Hegelianism

False

- Behaviorism (almost entirely)
- Empiricism
- Linguistic relativism (at least in its entirety)
- Positivism

## Epistemology: How much can we know?

Christian worldviews have a wide scope to describe our understanding:

- Both **critical realism** and **representationalism** works fine because they get into details about *how* we understand more than whether understanding is *possible*.
- **Disjunctivism** works, simply because we obviously can perceive things wrongly.
- **Infinitism** can work, but only if we recurse or loop the reasons on themselves (since God's thoughts create an original reason).
- **Intuitionism** and **logicism** work well (as well as the opposite in **preintuitionism**), since Christian doctrine doesn't concern itself much about the details of [math](math.md).
- **Operationalism** works because our observations can create values.
- Both **relationalism** and **substantivalism** go *far* deeper into the weeds about how [language](language.md) and [understanding](understanding.md) work than anything *remotely* in Christian doctrine.

**Deconstructionism** (along with **existentialism**, **interpretivism**, and **perspectivism**) *can* be true, but must stop with *most* of our understanding.

- The trouble with **Christian existentialism** and **Christian existential humanism**, though, is that it implies the universe is conceived of endless deceptions and uncertainties, which goes against the idea that the universe has inherent design characteristics formed for mankind to have a relationship with God.

**Fallibilism** presumes our minds are stable enough that we can keep things logically consistent and well-maintained.

**Reliablism** *can* work, but is difficult because knowledge could just as easily come through the soul's innate grasp of a thing, *without* a reliable method (e.g., God giving direct understanding).

The existence of **tautology** must necessarily exist for the Bible to exist, whether in spirit or in implementation.

### The verdict on how much we can know

True

- Tautology

Possible (or partial)

- Critical realism
- Disjunctivism
- Infinitism (if the reasons recurse)
- Intuitionism
  - Logicism
- Operationalism
- Preintuitionism
- Relationalism
- Representationalism
- Substantivalism

Possible (but difficult)

- Deconstructionism (as long as it's our understanding isn't *completely* unknowable)
  - Existentialism
    - Christian existentialism
    - Christian existential humanism
  - Interpretivism
  - Perspectivism
- Fallibilism
- Reliablism
