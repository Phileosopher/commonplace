# Christianity's compatibility with philosophy

This is a breakdown of [my philosophy glossary](glossary-philosophy.md), focused on indicating what is possible to be true in light of Christianity. It would be helpful to place that one next to this one as you read.

The angle here is to assume that all things are possible, unless there's a materially significant conflict with Christian doctrine.

- If God's desire is to draw people from all walks of life, then that will encompass all forms of philosophy, so it would be close-minded to assume more specific values than what is legitimately possible.
- It is reasonable to assume, however, that any population of mature Christians will invariably develop a narrower scope of belief over time.

This is, therefore, less of a clear picture of what *is* correct, and more of a clear image of what *can* be believed within the legitimate body of Christ.

- Anything "True" is literally essential to being a Christian.
- Absolutely *anything* "Possible" can coexist with the Christian faith (especially when they're [new believers](christian-new.md)), though some of them can legitimately damage a person's relationship with God (even if it doesn't outright destroy it).
- Anything "False" is literally impossible to harmonize with the Christian faith.

## Metaphysics: How many parts is reality made of?

Since we are distinctly *not* God, but God has distinctly made the universe and everything in it, then all Christian metaphysics must necessarily be **dualism** across reality (except moral dualism, since Christians define [immorality](morality.md) as the *absence* of good).

- **Cartesianism/Substance dualism** can't exist strictly, since there are enough Bible verses to indicate that the [a person](humanity.md) is composed of the collective whole that incorporates *both* their mind and body (e.g., flesh/spirit battle expressed in [Romans 7:15](https://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm)).
- **Epiphenomenalism** isn't possible, since the very universe itself was corrupted by our severed ties between us and God (which is arguably a mental experience more than a physical one).
- **Mentalism** is, by Christian theology, necessarily true, since at least some part of our minds are part of our souls, which live on past this life while our brains will decay with the rest of our bodies.
- **Realism** is also necessarily true, at least regarding *our* perspective. However, if we argue that God's perspective is what holds the universe together, then **acosmism** is true according to God's perspective, and realism would therefore be incorrect.
  - Given that our hearts are thoroughly deceitful, and that we shouldn't lean on our understanding, **Na√Øve/Direct/Perceptual/Common-sense realism** (*and* its polar opposite **sensualism**) can't be true.

However, **monism** and **pluralism** could certainly exist *within* the universe as a subset of dualism.

- Monism evokes many [feelings](mind-feelings.md) to associate everything with everything else.
  - **Dynamism** is certainly possible if the connections between matter are inseparable from matter itself (e.g., quantum superstates).
  - **Idealism** is entirely possible, especially if we define the universe as something created for a relationship with God.
    - **German idealism** is possible to believe if we assume our minds develop a type of "commentary" on what we perceive.
    - **Objective idealism** is possible, but only if we assert that the perception of God defines what exists. Some theologies of hell, however, make this impossible (since it'd be God's non-perception).
    - **Subjective idealism** can't be true, since our minds and God's mind are intrinsically separate things that certainly both exist.
  - **Materialism** (and its derivatives in **dialectical materialism**, **historical materialism**, **naturalism**, and **physicalism**) isn't possible in Christian doctrine, since there is a *lot* of Scripture revolving around the concept of a "spirit" state that transcends a physical one.
    - In particular, **Christian materialism**, despite its name, requires indicating that only Jesus exists, and we are illusions, which takes away from any meaningful relationship God would have with us.
    - Physicalism's variants (**eliminative materialism**, **emergent materialism**, **French materialism**, **reductionism**, and **revisionary mateirialism**) are abiding by [science's](science.md) latest [trends](trends.md), but don't hold up if we assume that God is a spirit being of any form.
- Pluralism is also entirely possible if we believe that some things are designed to transcend [human understanding](understanding.md).
  - **Holism** and **organicism** has plenty of use. An example would be how the Church with all its members together is more value than each individual within the Church.
  - At the same time, **reductionism** (and **ontological reductionism**) is also significant in its place. After all, as a [thought experiment](paradoxes.md), Jesus would still have died for one single human being.

### The verdict on reality's parts

True

- Dualism
  - Mentalism

Possible (and useful)

- Pluralism (if some things are designed to transcend human understanding)
  - Holism
  - Organicism
  - Reductionism
    - Ontological reductionism

Possible (somewhat)

- Acosmism (if God's perspective holds the universe together)
- Realism (likely)
- Monism (as a subset)
  - Dynamism (if matter and its connections are inseparable)
  - Idealism (if we conclude the universe was created for a relationship with God)
    - German idealism (since our perceptions are a "commentary" on what exists)
    - Objective idealism (if we assert that God defines what exists)

False

- Some forms of dualism
  - Substance dualism
  - Epiphenomenalism
  - Common-sense realism
  - Sensualism
- Monism (as a superset)
  - Subjective idealism
  - Materialism (and *all* subsets)

## Metaphysics: Does reality exist?

There is no way that God's standard of justice is relative, so **absolutism** is undeniably true and **relativism** is undeniably false.

- Further, our beliefs about [God's omniscience](god.md) almost mandate a further belief in **necessitarianism** (since God doesn't technically perceive "possibility", even though we do).

The very real nature of [sin](morality-sins.md) and our implicit need for a Savior makes severe constraints on reality:

- **Accidentalism** isn't possible, since cause-and-effect is a very real thing.
- **Nominalism** can't be true because the truth of sin requires there to be an objective reality associated with a moral failing.
  - However, **conceptualism** is still possible, especially if we lean into idealism.
- **Illusionism** can't be true, since God creates actual, tangible things.
- **Immaterialism** can't be true either, since there are material, real consequences that we face as a consequence of material, real [decisions](decisions.md) we have made.

**Eternalism** is certainly *partly* true, at least with reference to God. Our beliefs about what God knows and how long He has known it will affect how far it goes.

**Philosophical presentism** also has a tremendous amount of possibility, since the past is simply [memories](understanding.md) and the future is simply [imagination](imagination.md).

### The Verdict

True

- Absolutism

Possible (and useful)

- Eternalism (with respect to God)
- Philosophical presentism

Possible (somewhat)

- Conceptualism

False

- Accidentalism
- Nominalism
- Illusionism
- Immaterialism

## Metaphysics: What is reality made of?

**Anti-realism** is necessarily true in some part, since God knows what we don't, and we can't fully know God's plans.

- **Modal realism** is also at least somewhat true, given how much value God gives regarding keeping our minds and hearts pure.

**Atomism** is hard to *not* be true, since God has a cumulative design structure that uses many small things to make bigger things (e.g., protons/neutrons/electrons for all matter, neurons for all brains).

- The extremes, though, of **Buddhist atomism** and **Greek atomism** can't be true, since there's a clearly sustaining nature to atoms, but they were certainly created by God at some time in the past and will some time in the future cease to exist.

**Constructivism** certainly has merit, since our minds have constraints on what we can perceive.

**Determinism** is necessarily true in some way, since God has designed everything and knows what will happen.

- **Hereditarianism** is very possible, and likely true, especially when we consider that Scripture indicates aspects such as curses passing across generations ([Exodus 34:7](https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-7.htm)).
- **Finalism** is, in some ways, a vastly [meaningful](meaning.md) perspective within Christianity, since [Jesus will eventually create a right solution](jesus-returns.md) to all failings within society.
- However, subsets of determinism like **biologism**, **historical determinism**, and **historicism** can't be true, since our decisions are inalienably our responsibility and God is always capable of intervening to change the course of events.
- On a smaller scale, though, **indeterminism** is also possible, since misfortune happens evenly to both righteous and sinners ([Matthew 5:45](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm)).

**Emanationism** is a necessary Christian principle, since God literally made *everything* in the first place.

- While **occasionalism** can exist, it can't be complete because we would then have to conclude that God caused us to sin, which is *not* true ([James 1:13](https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm)).
- **Ontologism** is also entirely possible within Christian theology, and there is Scripture to back it ([Romans 1:20](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm)).

**Essentialism** is entirely possible, but only if we believe beyond a certain amount of [order](values.md).

**Hylozoism** is *potentially* possible, but it's a stretch. It would require defining souls as physical things (and not merely spiritual).

- However, **vitalism** has a high likelihood to be true, since our souls aren't a [scientifically measurable](science.md) thing.
- **Panpsychism** may have truth, depending how it's defined and what we qualify as having a "mind".

**Physicalism** and **mechanism** can't be true, since God is spirit ([John 4:24](https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm)).

**Intrinsicism** can sit alongside Christian theology, especially since we were thoughts of God before we became physical beings ([Psalm 139:13-16](https://biblehub.com/psalms/139.htm)).

- Even **Platonism** is possible if we assume that the forms of the universe are contained within God's mind, though there can't be any "goodness" inherent to the forms relative to their physical expressions.

**Optimism** is the only reliable Christian way to see this universe (e.g., [Liebniz' "best of all possible worlds"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds)), and necessitates that **pessimism** can't be true in any grand scope.

**Voluntarism** is profoundly true if we believe God literally *designed* the universe for our relationship with Him (which places our wills into a higher value than we'd otherwise imagine).

### The verdict on reality's composition

True

- Determinism
  - Hereditarianism
  - Finalism
- Emanationism

Possible (and useful)

- Atomism (since God designed everything from smaller components)
- Anti-realism (since God has hidden plans)
  - Modal realism (since God cares so much about how we see things in our minds)
- Constructivism (since our minds have constraints on what we can perceive)
- Essentialism
- Indeterminism (at a small scale)
- Intrinsicism (since we were God's "thoughts" first)
- Ontologism
- Optimism (in general)

Possible (somewhat)

- Platonism (if the "form" isn't inherently superior to the form's reflection)
- Vitalism (since our souls aren't scientifically measurable)
- Voluntarism (if our wills are the reason for the universe's existence)

Possible (but difficult)

- Hylozoism
- Panpsychism
- Pessimism (on a small scale)

False

- Atomism (at its extremes)
  - Buddhist atomism
  - Greek atomism
- Determinism (in some forms)
  - Biologism
  - Historical determinism
  - Historicism
- Occasionalism
- Physicalism
  - Mechanism

## Metaphysics: Who runs reality?

**Animism** can be entirely true, but any spiritual authority will be subordinate to God's authority.

While anti-theism is somewhat true, **nontheism** simply can't be true if Christianity holds truth.

- **Agnosticism** (and its subsets, and the hybrid of **transtheism**) are untrue, since the God of the Bible is *certainly* knowable with distinctive qualities.
- **Atheism** (and its subsets) are untrue, since there obviously *is* a God.
- Further, hybrids and derivatives like **Agnostic atheism** and **Ignosticism** can't be true either.
- While it isn't direct, **Darwinism** is very difficult to harmonize with Christianity and requires plenty of [symbolic associations](symbols.md) to come to that conclusion.

Christianity is essentially and indisputably a subset of **theism**.

- In particular, it's vastly and non-negotiably **monotheism**.
  - **Augustinianism** is definitely true, since the dichotomy of spiritual and physical does *not* have an implicit goodness or badness (i.e., there are spiritual [demons](spiritual-warfare.md) and angels, there are physical sinners and physical Jesus Christ as sinless).
  - **Classical theism** is at least *somewhat* true, but the essence of Jesus makes it impossible to go all the way with the idea (since He wants a [friendship](people-4_friends.md) with us and is therefore affected by our lives and [decisions](decisions.md) by extension).
  - **Deism** can't be true, since God has a clearly vested interest in humanity's decisions and development.
  - Since God is *clearly* distinct from the universe, **pantheism**, **panentheism**, **pandeism**, **monistic theism** can't be true.
  - **Substance monotheism** is necessary in some form as a necessary basis of understanding the Trinity.
- Christianity also necessitates **creationism**, with the universe being a clear product of God's design.
  - **Young Earth creationism** is the only logical conclusion without incorporating [modern scientific trends](science.md).
    - It's even possible to believe the more radical **Omphalos creationism**.
  - **Theistic evolution** (and its neighbors **Old Earth creationism** and **gap creationism**) requires merging with Darwinism, and is difficult to logically validate.
- While **philosophical theism** is *possible* for a Christian, it's a very shaky ground because it implies that one can find salvation without God's divine revelation (which [simply can't happen by merely observing nature](jesus-gospel.md)).
- **Polytheism** is not true, at least with respect to the universe's creation.
  - However, it *is* possible to fully believe **monolatry** as a Christian, though **henotheism** (and its subset **kathenotheism**) go too far with the idea.
- **Substantialism** is also possible, since God made everything.

### The verdict on reality's manager

True

- Theism (generally)
  - Augustinian theism
  - Substance monotheism
- Creationism

Possible (and useful)

- Creationism (in a few forms)
  - Young Earth creationism (driven by either [scientific beliefs](science.md) or [the Bible](bible.md) directly)
  - Omphalos creationism (which effectively throws out scientific beliefs)

Possible (somewhat)

- Animism (as long as it's subordinate to God's authority)
- Theism (in some forms)
  - Classical theism
- Substantialism (since God made everything)
- Polytheism (by defining "gods" outside of worthiness of worship)
  - Monolatry

Possible (but difficult)

- Darwinism
- Theistic evolution
  - Old Earth creationism
  - Gap creationism
- Philosophical theism

False

- Nontheism
  - Agnosticism
  - Atheism
  - Agnostic atheism
  - Ignosticism
- Deism
- Polytheism (almost entirely)
  - Henotheism
  - Kathenotheism

## Epistemology: What is knowledge?

Since materialism can't be true, **behaviorism** and its subsets are false (with only a few exceptions).

- The implication that God can grant divine revelation means **psychological behaviorism** has some grains of truth.
- **Methodological behaviorism** has truths contained within it, specifically in how we can't [control](power-types.md) what others think and only what they do.
  - Further, there is a *soft* proven reality about **post-Skinnerism** (e.g., the domains of [economics](economics.md) and [political science](politics-systems.md)).

**Rationalism** is a logical consequence of believing a human soul exists, which also means **empiricism** (with **associationism** and **verificationism**) are effectively wrong.

- As a side effect, **positivism** can't be correct either.
- Further, **innatism** is necessary to believe God instills morality into us from the beginning ([Romans 1:20](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm)).

**Presuppositionalism** is necessary to believe God interacts with us through revelation and not simply logic.

Many domains of understanding can work well without any conflict:

- **Conventionalism** can exist, but only to describe *some* human universals.
- **Dialetheism** is entirely possible, since our understanding of the truth may be in error.
- **Ethnocentrism** is at least partly true (including **methodological relativism** and **polylogism**), but there must be a carve-out for divine revelation and the work of the Holy Spirit.
- Both **internalism** and **externalism** are connected to Christian doctrine:
  - There is Scripture that warns against associating with the wrong types of people (i.e., externalism).
  - We are held individually and uncompromisingly responsible for our innermost desires and beliefs, not just our actions (i.e., internalism).
- **Linguistic determinism**, as well as **descriptivism**, can have a Christian basis.
  - However, **linguistic relativism** can't be complete, since that would make the Bible partly irrelevant.
- **Logical atomism** can help us to [understand the primitives](https://trendless.tech/primitives/) that hold up what we believe.
- **Phenomenalism** gives some relativistic view on how we perceive, which can work up to a point.

Both **externism** and **solipsism** (as well as **transcendental idealism** and **Hegelianism**) are possible, but difficult because we're not supposed to lean on our own understanding ([Proverbs 3:5](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-5.htm)).

### The verdict on the essence of knowledge

True

- Rationalism
- Innatism
- Presuppositionalism

Possible (and useful)

- Conventionalism (as long as we don't go all the way with it)
- Dialetheism (since ideas can be complicated)
- Externalism (because our environment defines our thoughts)
- Internalism (because we are morally responsible for our thoughts)
- Logical atomism

Possible (somewhat)

- Ethnocentrism (except for what God can do)
  - Methodological relativism
  - Polylogism
- Linguistic determinism (but not completely)
  - Descriptivism
- Phenomenalism (as long as there is absolute behind it)

Possible (but difficult)

- Behaviorism (on a few points)
  - Psychological behaviorism (since God can grant divine revelation)
  - Methodological behaviorism (since we can't control others' thoughts)
  - Post-Skinnerism (since people are *kindasorta* predictable in large groups)
- Externism
- Solipsism
  - Transcendental idealism
  - Hegelianism

False

- Behaviorism (almost entirely)
- Empiricism
- Linguistic relativism (at least in its entirety)
- Positivism

## Epistemology: How much can we know?

Christian worldviews have a wide scope to describe our understanding:

- Both **critical realism** and **representationalism** works fine because they get into details about *how* we understand more than whether understanding is *possible*.
- **Disjunctivism** works, simply because we obviously can perceive things wrongly.
- **Infinitism** can work, but only if we recurse or loop the reasons on themselves (since God's thoughts create an original reason).
- **Intuitionism** and **logicism** work well (as well as the opposite in **preintuitionism**), since Christian doctrine doesn't concern itself much about the details of [math](math.md).
- **Operationalism** works because our observations can create values.
- Both **relationalism** and **substantivalism** go *far* deeper into the weeds about how [language](language.md) and [understanding](understanding.md) work than anything *remotely* in Christian doctrine.

**Deconstructionism** (along with **existentialism**, **interpretivism**, and **perspectivism**) *can* be true, but must stop with *most* of our understanding.

- The trouble with **Christian existentialism** and **Christian existential humanism**, though, is that it implies the universe is conceived of endless deceptions and uncertainties, which goes against the idea that the universe has inherent design characteristics formed for mankind to have a relationship with God.

**Fallibilism** presumes our minds are stable enough that we can keep things logically consistent and well-maintained.

**Reliablism** *can* work, but is difficult because knowledge could just as easily come through the soul's innate grasp of a thing, *without* a reliable method (e.g., God giving direct understanding).

The existence of **tautology** must necessarily exist for the Bible to exist, whether in spirit or in implementation.

### The verdict on how much we can know

True

- Tautology

Possible (or partial)

- Critical realism
- Disjunctivism
- Infinitism (if the reasons recurse)
- Intuitionism
  - Logicism
- Operationalism
- Preintuitionism
- Relationalism
- Representationalism
- Substantivalism

Possible (but difficult)

- Deconstructionism (as long as it's our understanding isn't *completely* unknowable)
  - Existentialism
    - Christian existentialism
    - Christian existential humanism
  - Interpretivism
  - Perspectivism
- Fallibilism
- Reliablism

## Axiology: How do we find purpose?

It's entirely possible to have a meaningless form of Christianity, though it's not recommended:

- **Absurdism** is difficult to justify, since God designed the universe for us and it is literally *designed* to give us purposes.
- **Nihilism** is also possible, but sabotages the implicit meaning of God's design.
  - **Fatalism**, in particular, is only possible with Christian doctrine if we see God's omniscience as taking away the value of our [agency](decisions.md).

**Anthropomorphism** is acceptable, and in some ways *encouraged* by God (i.e., the Bible refers to God's "hands", God's pronoun is a "him/he").

To an extent, **egoism's descriptive aspects** (and both **cynicism** and **psychological egoism**) is true (i.e., our sin condition), but it can't be all-inclusive or there would be no hope for humanity's moral redemption.

As a derivative of humanism, **Freudianism** is possible, but never directly addresses our moral condition correctly.

**Hedonism** must be fundamentally true as a description of our pleasure-seeking design.

### The verdict on how we find purpose

True

- Hedonism

Possible (or partial)

- Anthropomorphism

Possible (but difficult)

- Absurdism
- Egoism (outside of what God does)
  - Cynicism
  - Psychological egoism
- Freudianism
- Nihilism
  - Fatalism

## Axiology: Where *should* we place our purposes?

In Christianity, **amor fati** is all depending on perspective:

- Knowing that God is ultimately in control should give us some degree of closure.
- However, the value system goes too far when it minimizes the emotional realities of present hardships.

**Anthropocentrism** is a fundamental belief of Christianity, with the idea that the universe is all designed for man's relationship with God.

Christianity conforms to **immortalism**, even including nearly every doctrine of hell (since eternal destruction would mean never actually being destroyed).

While **pragmatism** can exist, it doesn't serve as a greater place than what God wants.

**Teleologism** can affect Christianity profoundly through the understanding that God designs everything *very* cleverly with a purpose.

### The verdict on where we should place our purposes

True

- Immortalism

Possible (or partial)

- Amor fati
- Anthropocentrism (if it's about man's relationship with God, and not just man)
- Pragmatism
- Teleologism

## Axiology: How should we gain knowledge?

Since our [certainty](understanding-certainty.md) can never be complete (given our fallen state and God's commands to trust Him), the approach in Scripture to gaining knowledge is somewhat unimportant by comparison:

- **Coherentism** and **foundationalism** are both fine, though good theology leans toward foundationalism.
  - However, in some ways, **functionalism** may have more merit, simply because it leans against reductive materialism and logical behaviorism.
- **Critical rationalism** (along with **falsificationism**) has merit, since even science [science](science.md) can't fully validate our understanding.
  - However, **pancritical rationalism** goes too far, since it interferes with God's direct authority.
- **Logical positivism** has some use, but could be regarded as a waste of time, and makes **comtism** is a *complete* waste of time.

**Deism** can't work because the basis for knowledge comes *at least* partly through God's inspiration.

**Experientialism** can be validated in some ways (e.g., [Luke 1:3-4](https://biblehub.com/luke/1.htm)).

**Inductionism** has enough Scripture to indicate it's at least partly true (especially in [Proverbs](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1.htm)), but it can't be complete.

- **Inductivism** and **scientism** can't be true due to our fallen state affecting the scientific community.
- **Psychologism** is likely untrue unless we define Scripture as a type of philosophical study.

**Instrumentalism** has some degree of truth to it, simply because love is materially more important than truth.

**Irrealism** doesn't work because it sits on the presumption of physicalism having value.

**Kierkegaardianism** is possible, but takes a *lot* of work and requires being very smart.

**Occamism (Occam's razor)** has a *ton* of use, and is often the role of most [church leadership](mgmt-church.md).

- Further, many [modern churches](history-church.md) have proven **greedy reductionism**, *especially* on critical doctrinal issues.

**Phenomenal conservatism** must necessarily be true regarding God, though it doesn't always extend to society (e.g., being "shrewd as serpents" in [Matthew 10:16](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm)).

**Skepticism** (and the domains of **postmodernism**, **probabiliorism**, **probabilism**, and **pyrrhonism**) is *very* difficult to harmonize with Christianity, since it alienates the general nature of God's design for the universe.

Implicitly, Christians do believe a form of **structuralism** within [God's ultimate plans](https://theologos.site/god-sight/).

Believing in absolute truth defies **subjectivism**, and by implication **post-structuralism**.

**Syncretism** is a *very* common reality within Christianity, in many directions, with the most prevalent one being the base concept of being "[born again](jesus-gospel.md)".

### The verdict on how we should gain knowledge

True

- Structuralism
- Syncretism

Possible (and useful)

- Inductionism
- Occam's razor
  - Greedy reductionism
- Phenomenal conservatism (with respect to God)

Possible (or partial)

- Coherentism
- Critical rationalism
- Experientialism
- Falsificationism
- Foundationalism
- Functionalism
- Instrumentalism
- Logical positivism

Possible (but difficult)

- Comtism
- Kierkegaardianism
- Phenomenal conservatism (with respect to anything *but* God)
- Psychologism
- Skepticism
  - Postmodernism
  - Probabiliorism
  - Probabilism
  - Pyrrhonism

False

- Deism
- Pancritical rationalism
- Inductivism
- Irrealism
- Scientism
- Subjectivism
- Post-structuralism

## Axiology: What is the most moral thing to do (greatest good)?

A relationship with Jesus is portrayed directly as a form of *very* personal **mysticism**.

- *All* Christians convert by accepting a form of **defeatism** about our moral state.
- To even acknowledge that defeatism, they must accept some level of **objectivism** (at least with how God sees it).
- To follow Jesus is to accept a form of **altruism** (and **collectivism**, to some degree) as a directive on how to live.
- The altruism in Christ also happens to be a *very* radical and specific form of **pacifism**.

Some ideas are *possible*, but don't capture the spirit of Scripture:

- **Antinatalism** (particularly with [leftward thinking](politics-leftism.md)) is possible, but difficult to validate in light of God's love for humanity (and desire for more people as a logical product of it).
- **Antinominianism** is possible due to the scope of Jesus' sacrifice, but it misses Jesus' general directive to "go and sin no more" ([John 8:11](https://biblehub.com/john/8-11.htm)).
- **Asceticism** is possible to conclude, though it has been taken too far (e.g., [1 Corinthians 8](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8.htm)).

The call to Christ has an implicit opposition to *all* **ethical egoism**.

- To a lesser extent, it's *very* difficult to uphold **careerism**, **consumerism**, and **emotionalism**.

Christianity *could* be classified as a type of **ethical hedonism**, with the joy derived from a relationship with God being the greatest good.

- However, it can't be the highest end, which makes most implementations of **Epicureanism** far too extreme.
- In a sense conformity to God's standards is a type of **utilitarianism**, though it requires justifying the calculation as being beyond our understanding.
- Further, if the Body of Christ is a [new adoptive family](church-family.md), there is an aspect of **role ethics**.

Since Christianity opposes naturalism, **humanistic naturalism** can't be consistent with it.

The certainty of Scripture and God's commands makes **immoralism** impossible.

Since God's divine inspiration is the best way to gain understanding, **intellectualism** is difficult to maintain without defining divine inspiration as part of our reasoning.

Christianity has a type of **irrationalism** (through the understanding of divine inspiration), but doesn't go far enough that it completely dismisses the value of reasoning.

Strong Christians often adopt a form of **perfectionism** (such as the idea of [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md)).

Following Jesus requires a humble attitude driven toward love for others, so both **Randianism** and **Stoicism** are entirely *possible*, but difficult to harmonize.

### The verdict on the most moral thing to do

True

- Altruism
- Defeatism
- Mysticism
- Objectivism
- Pacifism

Possible (and useful)

- Immoralism

## Axiology: Do we have free will?

*Some* Christians believe in **incompatibilism**, but most Christians believe a form of **compatibilism/soft determinism**.

- Many Christians also advance **open theism**.
- A few Christian sects assert a type of **metaphysical libertarianism**.

**Personalism** is also entirely possible without any issues.

### The verdict on free will

Possible (and useful)

- Compatibilism/soft determinism
- Open theism

Possible (or partial)

- Incompatibilism
- Libertarianism
- Personalism

## Axiology: How can mankind be morally saved by an all-knowing God?

In **soteriology**, multiple doctrines can be at least mostly consistent with Scripture:

- **Arminianism** and **Calvinism** are mostly the same, but hinge heavily on whether people can resist God's calling.
- **Molinism** is possible for Christians, and even *likely* in many doctrines of the Trinity.
- **Fideism** makes a hard distinction between faith and reasoning.

**Pelagianism** can be justified, but needs a bit more criteria to clarify it, but has been regarded as heresy by the Christian church at large.

- **Semipelagianism** is a hybrid, and therefore a little easier to work with, but has many of the same issues.

**Gnosticism** isn't possible for Christianity, since it takes away from the simple directive to believe in Jesus.

### The verdict on how salvation happens with God's omniscience

True

- Soteriology

Possible (and useful)

- Molinism

Possible (or partial)

- Arminianism
- Calvinism
- Fideism

Possible (but difficult)

- Pelagianism
  - Semipelagianism

False

- Gnosticism

## Aesthetics: What should we define as quality?

**Aestheticism** can be very true in Christianity, particularly if a relationship with God is not built inherently on a [purpose](purpose.md) but instead on an essence.

While **aesthetic formalism** has merit, it goes too far if it straddles into someone's ethical issues with a social or historical context.

**Romanticism** has value until it becomes an ethical consideration.

### The verdict on what we should define as quality

Possible (and useful)

- Aestheticism

Possible (or partial)

- Aesthetic formalism (until it defiles another's conscience)
- Romanticism (until it becomes an ethical matter)

## Aesthetics: How should we [create](mind-creativity.md)?

It's hard to *not* argue that God's divinely inspired [creations](creations.md) are performed via **automatism**, and worth considering in light of [spiritual gifts](spiritual-gifts.md).

**Classicism** is a *huge* aspect of Christian tradition, especially with respect to art.

In a sense, creating without a focus on God can be risky, and **modernism** and **primitivism** can create adverse consequences when not merged with other values.

While creating against the essence of order can magnify the human experience, there's a "middle ground" in the domains of **expressionism**, **surrealism**, and **symbolism** that avoids detracting from God's glory.

### The verdict on how we should create

True

- Automatism (for Scripture)

Possible (and useful)

- Automatism (for everything we make)
- Classicism

Possible (or partial)

- Expressionism
- Surrealism
- Symbolism

Possible (but difficult)

- Modernism
- Primitivism

False

## Ethics

Both **cognitivism** and **moral realism** have merit, but can be sidestepped if God *is* morality incarnate (which can remove any reasoning we could make that navigates elements of it).

- On the other hand, **non-cognitivism** can't be true, since Christian doctrine draws a hard connection between ethical statements and truth.
- **Expressivism** may have some truth to it, but it's difficult to conceptualize in a Christian framing.

There's plenty of room for **emotivism** and **universal prescriptivism**.

There is room for **quasi-realism**, but it can't go so far that it defines *all* ethics as being purely emotional.

In many ways, Christian thinking embodies **value pluralism** directly, especially with respect to domains involving the Old vs. New Covenant.

### The verdict on how we should position our ethics

Possible (or partial)

- Cognitivism
  - Moral realism
- Emotivism
  - Universal prescriptivism
- Quasi-realism (as long as it's not complete)
- Value pluralism

Possible (but difficult)

- Expressivism

False

- Non-cognitivism

## Ethics: Why are things good or bad?

**Ascriptivism** is an inherent requirement to accept we are responsible for our sin, which is a requirement to accepting Christ's sacrifice.

**Consequentialism** (along with **eudaimonism** and **situational ethics**) is generally *not* true, except regarding what God can do (i.e., God's consequences are righteous).

- **Non-consequentialism** is *generally* true (i.e., follow God's directives).
  - In some ways it can adopt flavors of **extrinsicism** or **Kantianism**, but easily diverges when the motivation becomes love for God and others.

Most aspects of **humanism** *can* dovetail with Christianity, but will create dangerously dysfunctional theologies.

- **Meliorism** takes away from what God can do, implying people can rise to something beyond themselves.
- **Posthumanism** removes *any* greater [meaning](meaning.md) that God has for humanity.
- **Secular humanism** implies that our development is better without God being involved.
- While **transcendentalism** and **neo-Platonism** sound fine within a Christian context, they imply that mankind can self-promote themselves through some form of understanding or spirituality (which goes against the Christian doctrines of defeatism).
  - **Transhumanism**, along with **extropianism** and **singularitarianism**, imply transcendentalism, but through [science](science.md) and [technology](technology.md).
- **Religious humanism** and **Christian humanism** try to split the strong difference between humanism and Christianity, which severely dilutes anything legitimately Christian about it.

Christianity emphasizes **moral absolutism** (and therefore a type of **moral universalism**) based on God's perspective, which sabotages any hope for **moral relativism**.

### The verdict on why things are good or bad

True

- Ascriptivism
- Moral absolutism

Possible (or partial)

- Moral universalism
- Non-consequentialism
  - Extrinsicism
  - Kantianism

Possible (but difficult)

- Consequentialism (except for God)
  - Eudaimonism
  - Situational ethics
- Humanism (in every one of its forms)

False

- Moral relativism

## Political Science: Can we understand politics and society?

The unpredictable aspects of living in a fallen world with some people being regenerated by the Holy Spirit make **behavioralism** difficult to implement.

- At the same time, **economic formalism** ends up being remarkably consistent about human nature.

**Interactionism** has merit, and is arguably how God works.

**Social atomism** has limited use due to the changing spiritual nature of each individual at any given point in time.

### The verdict on how much we can understand politics and society

Possible (or partial)

- Economic formalism
- Interactionism

Possible (but difficult)

- Behavioralism
- Social atomism

## Political Science: What's wrong with society?

Since the entire *point* of Christianity is that Jesus is a personal and eternal King, **anarchism** (as well as **anarcho-primitivism** and **anarcho-syndicalism**) is difficult to justify.

The issue of sin is more prevalent than any issues created from [technology](technology.md), so environmentalism is difficult to harmonize.

The male/female dichotomy in Christian doctrine leans heavily toward **complementarianism** and away from **feminism**.

Since **Marxism** (and **Communism**, **distributism**, **Neo-Marxism**, and **Socialism**) branches from dialectical materialism, it's inherently against Christianity, and it is *absurdly* difficult to harmonize the two (though its ideals represent a vision that has aspects close to [what Jesus will institute when He comes back](https://theologos.site/millennium/)).

**Mohism** contains some truths, but implies that human nature can self-conform to being more loving, which defies Christian defeatism.

Christians *do* believe in a type of **reconstructivism**, but is asserted on a much more individual level in this life.

### The verdict on what's wrong with society

Possible (and useful)

- Complementarianism
- Reconstructivism

Possible (or partial)

- Mohism

Possible (but difficult)

- Anarchism
  - Anarcho-primitivism
  - Anarcho-syndicalism
- Environmentalism
- Feminism
- Marxism
  - Communism
  - Distributism
  - Neo-Marxism
  - Socialism

## Political Science: Who should have power in society?

Since Christianity leans into honoring *whatever* government is in control, many government policies are acceptable to them.

- **Communalism** and **individualism** are both acceptable (as well as **communitarianism**), though Christianity leans a little bit toward individualism.
- There is a type of **liberalism** present in Christianity, though it doesn't veer into fully permitting evil and leans away from **libertarianism**.
- Christians have a specific type of **contractarianism** that presumes God established national laws for the lawless ([1 Timothy 1:9](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm)).
- While the [modern technology trends](https://gainedin.site/machines/) advance **techno-progressivism**, Christians don't really care (with the specific exception of the "mark of the Beast" from [Revelation 13:16-17](https://biblehub.com/revelation/13.htm)).
- Christians also range wildly on the matter of **youthism**.

While they honor government, Christians *do* lean into some political ideas:

- **Egalitarianism** runs strongly, and works somewhat against **mercantilism** and **fascism**.
- They typically believe a type of **speciesism** since the Bible asserts that God created mankind different from all other creations.

All Christians believe in at least *some* form of **conservatism**, even if it's as simple as preserving Scripture itself.

Christians also must believe a degree of **nativism**, especially regarding many traditions and the Bible itself.

Given its secular background, Christians *can* believe **social Darwinism** and **critical race**, but it is difficult to justify alongside Scripture.

### The verdict on who should have power in society

True

- Conservatism
- Nativism

Possible (and useful)

- Contractarianism
- Egalitarianism
- Speciesism

Possible (or partial)

- Communalism
- Communitarianism
- Individualism
- Liberalism
- Techno-progressivism (except the mark of the Beast)
- Youthism

Possible (but difficult)

- Libertarianism
- Mercantilism
  - Fascism
- Social Darwinism
  - Critical race

## Political Science: How should we pick our leaders?

Since Christianity was formed during a polytheistic **theocracy**, there's very little precedent for more modern [political systems](politics-systems.md) (and even less precedent since the [Reformation](history-church.md)).

- **Capitalism** conforms well with the moral realities of man's sinful nature, but directs it toward a type of non-self-interested ends, though **anarcho-capitalism** takes the idea too far to easily conform it.
- **Democracy** connects well with Christian egalitarianism, though it isn't always a hard connection.
- While **political absolutism** (and **enlightened absolutism**) isn't discussed much among Christians, it's acceptable enough (since God will have the final judgment on political leadership).
- **Associationalism** serves as a hybrid between political absolutism and democracy, meaning there's no issue.

To the extent that Christians can disagree with it, they do *not* like alternate theocratic rule, meaning **Islamism** and **secularism** aren't preferable, though there is theological room to believe one of them is an inevitable reality.

### The verdict on how we should pick our leaders

Possible (and useful)

- Capitalism
- Democracy

Possible (or partial)

- Associationalism
- Political absolutism
  - Enlightened absolutism
- Theocracy

Possible (but difficult)

- Anarcho-capitalism

False

- Islamism (generally)
- Secularism (generally)

## Political Science: How should we enforce laws?

To believe in God's grace and mercy creates a general leaning against raw coercive approaches like **authoritarianism** and **totalitarianism**.

There is Christian precedent on *both* sides of some domains:

- **Legal formalism** (and **legalism** with **originalism**), since the rules represent the order of God, but loving behavior in a courtroom can mean bending the rules.
- **Political individualism**, since the downtrodden and suffering may be an individual, or may be a group.

Christians lean into the belief of **natural law** (and some level of **legal realism**), meaning they lean against **positive law** (as well as **legal interpretivism** and **legal naturalism**).

### The verdict on how we should enforce laws

Possible (and useful)

- Natural law

Possible (or partial)

- Legal formalism
- Political individualism
- Legal realism
- Legalism
  - Originalism

Possible (but difficult)

- Authoritarianism
  - Totalitarianism
- Legal interpretivism
- Positive law
  - Legal naturalism

## Philosophy's Culture

Christian philosophical discourse runs closer to their theological circles and applications toward [biblical interpretation](bible-study.md).

- **Aristotelianism** (as well as **Neo-Aristotelianism** and **contextualism**) is *very* strong within much of Christian culture.
- **Cognitivism** and **truth claims** is frequent in Christian tradition, typically within [apologetic evangelism](evangelism.md).
- **Eclecticism** is also frequent among Bible scholars.
- **Scholasticism** is not only common among Christian dialogue, it's part of the Bible!
- **Thomism** is necessary for any heavily measured Christian exploration, since there is no end to the study ([Ecclesiastes 12:12](https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm)).

**Particularism** isn't as common, but can be used without any issues.

In some ways, the **Platonic school** leans *against* most Christian thinking.

**Ancient sophism** works somewhat against Christianity, since the emphasis is on how to behave and *not* on abstracted virtue alone.

### The verdict on on philosophy's culture

True

- Scholasticism
- Thomism

Possible (and useful)

- Aristotelianism
  - Neo-Aristotelianism
- Contextualism
- Cognitivism
