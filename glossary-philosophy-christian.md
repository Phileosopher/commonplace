# Christianity's compatibility with philosophy

This is a breakdown of [my philosophy glossary](glossary-philosophy.md), focused on indicating what is possible to be true in light of Christianity. It would be helpful to place that one next to this one as you read.

The angle here is to assume that all things are possible, unless there's a materially significant conflict with Christian doctrine.

- If God's desire is to draw people from all walks of life, then that will encompass all forms of philosophy, so it would be close-minded to assume more specific values than what is legitimately possible.
- It is reasonable to assume, however, that any population of mature Christians will invariably develop a narrower scope of belief over time.

This is, therefore, less of a clear picture of what *is* correct, and more of a clear image of what *can* be believed within the legitimate body of Christ.

- Anything "True" is literally essential to being a Christian.
- Absolutely *anything* "Possible" can coexist with the Christian faith (especially when they're [new believers](christian-new.md)), though some of them can legitimately damage a person's relationship with God (even if it doesn't outright destroy it).
- Anything "False" is literally impossible to harmonize with the Christian faith.
