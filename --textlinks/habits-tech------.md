[Yevgeniy Brikman](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/)
(2013) The 10x developer is NOT a myth
> - If you can’t measure it, you can still reason about it
> - 10x programmers are rare
> - Programming is about choices

[Joe Zack](https://www.codingblocks.net/practice/four-reasons-why-10x-developer-controversial/)
(2018) 4 reasons why the “10x Developer” is so controversial
> 0 Productivity is hard to measure
> 1 Tiny sample size
> 2 Well, common sense….
> 3 The study was done over 50 years ago

[Yossi Kreinin aka wetware](https://yosefk.com/blog/evil-tip-avoid-easy-things.html)
(2016) Evil tip: avoid "easy" things
> To a very large extent, [your productivity is a result of what you choose to work on](https://yosefk.com/blog/10x-more-selective.html). Keep things perceived as easy out of that list. When you can't, postponing an "easy" thing can make it both "harder" and smaller.

[Yossi Kreinin aka wetware](https://yosefk.com/blog/10x-more-selective.html)
(2013) 10x more selective
> So I believe, having authored a lot of code that went down the toilet, that you don't get productive by working as much as by not working – not on stuff that is likely to get thrown away.

[Meghan Hebel](https://codeburst.io/why-you-dont-deserve-that-dream-developer-job-60d5e5adb8d7)
Why You Don’t Deserve That Dream Developer Job

[Itamar Turner-Trauring](https://codewithoutrules.com/2016/08/25/the-01x-programmer/)
(2016) From 10x programmer to 0.1x programmer: creating more with less

[Andrew Payne](https://payne.org/blog/the-myth-of-the-myth-of-the-10x-programmer/)
(2020) The Myth of the Myth of the 10x Programmer
> * I think 10x developers, like world-class athletes, musicians, and authors, absolutely do exist. You’re just not going to find them with a coding test.
> * Highly productive developers (10x or otherwise) are problem-solving at a much higher level.

[Itamar Turner-Trauring](https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/08/10/always-more-work-to-do/)
(2018) There’s always more work to do—but you still don’t need to work long hours
> Whenever you feel yourself with too much work to do, go back and apply these principles: underpromise, limit your own time, prioritize ruthlessly. With practice you’ll learn how to deliver the results that really matter—without working long hours.
