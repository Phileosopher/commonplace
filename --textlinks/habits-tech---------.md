(2018) Quality and effort
> * We need to put care into our systems. We need to build checklists and peer review and resilience into the way we express our carefulness.
> * It seems ridiculous that a surgeon needs to write her name (with a Sharpie) on the limb that she’s about to operate on, but this simple system adjustment means that errors involving working on the wrong limb will go to zero.
> * Instead of reacting to an error with, “I need to be more careful,” we can respond with, “I can build a better system.”
> * If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it.
