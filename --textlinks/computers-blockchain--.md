## cryptocurrency

There was a time when people thought that crypto might be a new asset class that was uncorrelated to other assets, but that seems like mostly a mistake. Crypto is a volatile infinite-duration asset; it goes up when risk appetite goes up or when interest rates go down, and down when risk appetite goes down or rates go up.

There is a LOT of [torrent/piracy] and [hacking] connected to cryptocurrency, as well as the [dark web](mayneedrefonwebdev?)
- this doesn't mean it's BAD, but that bad people are more keen on using it

[Just Say No to CBDCs - by N.S. Lyons - The Upheaval](https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/just-say-no-to-cbdcs)
- it's not unreasonable to assume that governments may adopt blockchain for the purpose of currency regulation
