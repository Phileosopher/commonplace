The speed that computers run means that most of the limits in building your own business is mostly based on how well you can [develop software](computers-software.md), along with the ability to [keep computers running](computers-distsys-enterprise.md) for the necessary services that software needs.

Of course, once an organization gets larger, the people running it have to spend more time [managing teams](mgmt-3_teams.md), which takes away from software development. It allows larger-scale work, but the hourly-rate new hires won't have the passion for it like the people who get paid more for doing a good job.

Eventually, the organization will mostly consist of wage slaves. Since the technology will have been established, the organization will keep maintaining and curating a potentially old "codebase". They won't want to change it under the "if it ain't broke don't fix it" mentality, partly from.

Thus, since [all computer code can be improved](computers-software-redesign.md), tech entrepreneurship always has room for freelancers and people who are willing to explore a new way to use computers.
