When people are willing to comply with others' standards, they're engaging in a type of [agreement or contract](people-contracts.md). We trust the parties we agree with because we have either developed a [habit](habits.md) of trusting in the past (i.e., proof of prior performance), or because we have some reason to [imagine](imagination.md) there will be future performance.

*Everything* we do with others that isn't out of [love](people-love.md) is an agreement for one of our [purposes](purpose.md):

- [Expectations](imagination.md) about what someone else is [capable of doing](mind-creativity-results.md), either from [conditioning](habits.md), past [results](mind-creativity-results.md), or [group favoritism](groups-member.md).
- A [fear](mind-feelings-fear.md), driven by self-preservation, from witnessing someone else's [power](power.md) to harm them.
- [Trust](trust.md) without any present basis over what someone had [said](people-conversation.md) in the past.

These agreements exist so we can feel safe about what others will do with us. In the absence of [evil](morality-evil.md), we wouldn't need them.

Each agreement works through a similar [story](stories.md):

1. Initial engagement by at least one person [expressing interest](people-conversation.md) in a [purpose](purpose.md) connected with someone else. In a casual engagement, it's usually a slow transition, with both sides respecting what they [see](image.md) as the others' rights.
2. Discussing a negotiation of terms, both implicit and explicit.
3. The entire duration of the agreement, which can last for minutes to decades. Both sides usually can [feel](mind-feelings.md) how long they [expect](imagination.md) the agreement to last, even without anything formalized.
4. The agreement will terminate if it stops being useful to *both* sides, sometimes prematurely. If the side with more [power](power.md) still wants the agreement, they can often [coerce](influence.md) the other side to stay in that agreement. In this world, nobody usually cares about the side with less power, though there's plenty of [politics](politics-conservativeliberal.md) in discussing it.

The negotiation often involves making promises based on boundaries set in the future (i.e., [expectations](imagination.md)). Even if we don't articulate those boundaries, we still hold them and expect others to respond at a later time.

The value we give to others in exchange for doing something (often represented as money) comes from a few variables:

1. How much we don't [enjoy](mind-feelings-happiness.md) the task.
2. How difficult it would be for us to [learn or do it ourselves](understanding.md).
3. How little we'd [trust](understanding-certainty.md) complete strangers to do the work.
4. The likelihood we [believe](understanding-certainty.md) that person would succeed at the task.
5. The consistency or inconsistency of finding *other* people to do that job.
6. How [dishonorable](image.md) or [disreputable](morality-taboo.md) the job is.

By using [language](language.md), we can make promises to clarify what we agree on. How well we honor those agreements has an *immense* impact on our [reputation](image.md).

Occasionally, these agreements become formal [rules](rules.md) if they outlast a few significantly impactful [trends](trends.md). In the case of long-term partnerships, such as [entrepreneurship](socialrisk.md) or [marriage](gender.md), the relationship will [influence](influence.md) and be part of many [trends](trends.md) across its duration.

The person or group who most wants to leave the engagement will transition through phases of distancing if they've found a better means to their [purpose](purpose.md):

1. Pursuing different [interests](purpose.md) than the other.
2. Performing different [actions](mind-creativity-results.md) than the other's [expectations](imagination.md).
3. Waiting indefinitely for the other party to engage in the inevitable looming [conflict](people-5_conflicts.md), and often intentionally avoiding them to prevent it.
4. Officially confronting the tension and terminating the shared experience.

In the case of a group who wants to keep [power](power.md), they'll try to make *new* agreements that intensify or add to possible [purposes](purpose.md) of the departing party. This is the cause of both harsh [government regulations](rules.md) and [pay increases](power-types.md).
