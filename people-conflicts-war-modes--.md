Opening:  Greetings!  Welcome to my first major production.  What the hell is
this guy babbling about "black books"?  Well, in the 60's a special forces
program was developed at the Frankford arsenal to develop and test improvised
explosives.  What you see here are the results of these tests.  Typed directly
from Army TM 31-210 and Desert Publication's Black Book Vol. III.  


Disclaimer: I take absolutely no responsibility for the use of this material,
whether it be direct or indirect.  What I have done here is simply provide this
information for one purpose only (har har) and that is for informational
purposes only.  All information here, however, should be taken as seriously as
the bible. You can very easily fuck up and get killed.  Please be very, very
careful (shit, i sound like your mother) when dealing with any of the items
presented here.  Note especially the section on improvised pistols.      


                                                thanx. and by god...

Procedure
---------

1.  Spread potassium chlorate crystals thinly on a hard surface.  Roll the
    round stick over crystals to crush into a very fine powder or wheat flower.

2.  Place 9 parts powdered potassium chlorate and 1 part petroleum jelly
    in a wide bowl or similar container.  Mix ingredients with hands 
    until a uniform paste is obtained.

Note: Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.


                                                            
Potassium Nitrate                                           Sec. I, No. 2

Potassium nitrate can be extracted from many natural sources and can be used to
make nitric acid, black powder and many pyrotechnics.  The yield ranges from .1
to 10% by weight, depending on the fertility of the soil.

punching tool

alcohol - 1 gallon (4 l) can be whiskey,
rubbing, etc.

heat source

paper

tape   

Note: Only the ratios of the amounts of ingredients are important.  Thus, for
twice as much, double all quantities.


Procedure
---------

1.  Punch holes in bottom of bucket.  Spread one piece of cloth over holes 
    inside bucket.

2.  Place wood ashes on cloth and spread to make a layer about the thickness of
    the cloth.  Place second piece of cloth on top of ashes.

3.  Place dirt in bucket.

4.  Place bucket over shallow container.  Bucket may be supported on sticks if
    necessary.

5.  Boil water and pour it over earth in bucket a little at a time.  Allow
    water to run through holes in bucket into shallow container.  Be sure water
    goes through all the earth.  Allow drained liquid to cool and settle for 1
    to 2 hours.

Note: Do not pour all the water at once, as this may cause stoppage.

6.  Carefully drain off liquid into heat resistant container.  Discard any 
    sludge remaining in bottom of the shallow container.

7.  Boil mixture over hot fire for at least 2 hours.  Small grains of salt will
    begin to appear in the solution.  Scoop these out as they form, using any 
    type of improvised strainer (paper, etc)

8.  When liquid has boilded down to approx. half its original volume, remove
    from fire and let sit.  After half an hour, add an equal volume of alcohol.
    When mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals will collect on
    top of it.

9.  To purify the potassium nitrate, re-dissolve the dry crystals in the 
    smallest possible amount of boiled water.  Remove any salt crystals that
    appear (step 7); pour through an improvised filter made of several pieces
    of paper and evaporate of gently heat the concentrated solution to dryness.

10. Spread crystals on plat surface and allow to dry.  The crystals are now 
    ready to use.

Wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups (.5 l)

Sulfur, powdered, .5 cup (1/8 l)

Alcohol, 5 pints (2.5 l) whiskey, rubbing, etc.

water 3 cups, (.75 l)

heat source

2 buckets- each 2 gallon (7.5 l) cap., one of
which must be heat resistant (metal, ceramic)

Flat window screen 1 foot square

large wooden stick

cloth, 2 ft. sq.


Procedure
---------

1.  Place alcohol in one of the buckets.

2.  Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant bucket.
    Add 1 cups water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all ingredients
    are dissolved.

3.  Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture.  Place bucket on heat source and 
    stir until small bubbles begin to form.

Note: Do NOT boil mixture.  Be sure all mixture stays wet.  If any is dry, as on sides of pan, it maignite.

4.  Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring 
    vigorously.

5.  Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes.  Strain mixture through cloth to
    obtain black powder.  Discard liquid.  Wrap cloth around black powder and
    squeeze to remove all excess liquid.

6.  Place screening over dry bucket.  Place workable amount of damp powder on
    screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen.

Note: If granulated particles appear to stick together and change shape,
recombine entire batch of powder and repeat steps 5 and 6.  

7.  Spread granulated powder on flat dry surface so that layer about .5" (1.25
    cm) is formed.  Allow to dry.  Use radiator, or direct sunlight.  This 
    should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in one hour.  The longer 
    the drying period, the less effective the black powder. 

Note: Remove from here as soon as granules are dry.  Black powder is now ready
for use.



                                                            
Nitric Acid                                                 Sec. I, No. 4

Nitric acid is used in the preparation of many explosives, incendiary mixtures
and acid delay timers.  It may be prepared by distilling a mixture of potassium
nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.

Materials                                       Sources
---------                                       -------

Potassium nitrate (2 parts by volume)           Drug store, improvised, (Sec. I
                                                No. 2)                   

Concentrated sulfuric acid (1 part by vol)      motor vehicle batteries,
                                                industrial plants

2 bottles or ceramic jugs (narrow necks
preferable)

pot or frying pan

Heat source

Tape (paper, electrical, not cellophane)

Paper or rags 

Note: If sulfuric acid is obtained from motor vehicles, it must be concentrated
by boiling until white fumes appear.  Do NOT inhale fumes.  Also, the amount of
nitric acid produced is the same as the amount of potassium nitrate used, so 
for 2 tablespoons of nitric acid, use 2 tablespoons potassium nitrate and 1
tablespoon sulfuric acid.

Procedure
---------

1.  Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug.  Add sulfuric acid.  Do not 
    fill more than 1/4 full  Mix until a paste is formed.

Note: Treat sulfuric acid like any other acid, wash affected skin with water,  
and dont inhale the fucking fumes.

2.  Wrap paper or rags around necks of 2 bottles.  Securly tape necks of 
    bottles together.  Be sure bottles are flush against each other and that 
    there are no air spaces.

3.  Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is slightly lower 
    than bottle sontaining paste so that nitric acid is formed in receiving 
    bottle will not run into other bottle.

4.  Build fire in pot or frying pan.

5.  Gently heat bottle containing mixture by moving fire in and out.  As
    red fumes begin to appear periodically pour cold water over empty receiving
    bottle.  Nitric acid will begin to form in the receiving bottle.

Note: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter.  As
an added protection, place bottle to be hated in a heat resistant container
filled with sand or gravel.  Hear this outer container to produce nitric acid.

6.  Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed.  If the
    nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it
    into cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.

Note:  Do not inhale fumes, and nitric acid should be stored in a sealed glass 
or ceramic container.




Initiator for dust explosions                               Sec I, No. 5

An initiator which will initiate common material to produce dust explosions can
be rapidly and easily constructed.  This type of charge is ideal for the
destruction of enclosed areas such as rooms or buildings.

Materials                                       Sources     
---------                                       -------

a flat can, 3 in. (8 cm) in diameter and
1-1.5 in. (3-3.75 cm) in height.  A 6.5 oz.
Tuna can serves the purpose quite well

blasting cap

explosive

aluminum (may be wire, cust sheet, flat can,
or powder)

large nail, 4 in. (10 cm) long

wooden rod, .25 in. (6 mm) in diameter

flour, gasoline, and powder or chipped aluminum

Note: Plastic explosives (comp. C4, etc.) produce larger explosions that cast
explosives (comp. B, etc).


Procedure
---------

1.  Using the nail, press a hole through the side of the Tuna can 3/8 to 1/2 
    in. (1-1.5 cm) from the bottom.  Using a rotating a lever action, enlarge 
    the hole until it will accomodate the blasting cap.

2.  Place the wodden rod in the hole and position the end of the rod at the 
    center of the can.

3.  Press explosive into the can, being sure to surround the rod, until it is
    3/4 in. (2 cm) from top of the can.  Carefully remove the wooden rod.

4.  Place the aliminum metal on top of the explosive.

5.  Just before use, insert the blasting cap into the cavity made by the
    rod.  The initiator is now ready for use.

Note: If it is desired to carry the initiator some distance, cardboard may be
pressed on top of the aluminum to insure against loss of material.


How to Use
----------

This particular unit works quite well to initiate charges of five pounds of
flour, 1/2 gallon (1 2/3 l) of gasoline or two pounds of flake painters
aluminum.  The solid materials may merely be contained in sacks or cardboard
cartons.  The gasoline may be placed in plastic coated paper milk cartons,
plastic or glass bottles.  The charges are placed directly on top of the
initiator and the blasting cap is actuated electrically or by fuse depending on
the type of cap used.  This will destroy a 2,000 cubic feet enclosure (building
10x20x10 feet)

Note: For larger enclosures, use proportionally larger initiators ad charges.

Fuel oil or gasoline and motor oil (1:1)        cars, trucks

Two flat boards, One which can be 
comfortably held in the hand, i.e., 2"x4",
and 36"x36" 
    
Bucket or other container for mixing items

Iron or steel pipe or bottle, tin can or heavy
walled cardboard tube

blasting cap

wooden rod, 1/4" in. diameter

spoon or similar measuring container


Procedure
---------

1.  Spread a hadful of the ammonium nitrate (an) on the large flat board and
    rub vigorously with the other board until the large particles are crushed
    into a very fine powder that looks like flour (approx. 10 min. per handful)

Note: Continue with step 2 as soon as possible, since the powder may take
moisture from the air and become spoiled.

2.  Mix on measure (cup, tablespoon, etc) of fuel oil with 16 measures of the 
    finely ground AN in a dry bucket or other suitable container and stir with
    the wooden rod.  If fuel oil is not available, use one half measure of 
    motor oil.  Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.

3.  Spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has and end cap 
    threaded on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin 
    can, a glass jar or a heavy-walled cardboard tube.

Note:  Take care not to tamp or shake the mixture in the pipe.  If mixture
becomes tightly packed, one cap will not be sufficient to initiate the
explosive.

4.  Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the explosive mix.

Note: Confining the open end of the container will add to the effectiveness of
the explosive.


Carbon Tet Explosive                                        Sec. I, No. 7

clear water- 3.5 cups  
        

Procedure
---------

1.  Place the sugar, potassium nitrate (pn), and water in the bucket.  Heat 
    with a low flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar and PN dissolve.

2.  If available, add the ferric oxide (rust) to the solution.  Increase the 
    flame under the mixture until it boils gently.

Note: The mixture will retain the rust coloration.

3.  Stro and scrape the bucket sides occasionally until the mixture is 
    reduced to one quarter its original volume, then stir continuously.

4.  As the water evaporates, the mixture will become thicker until it reaches
    the consistency of cooked breakfast cereal (yum!) or homemade fudge.  At
    this stage of thickness, remove the bucket from the hear source and spread
    the mass on the metal sheet.

5.  While the material cools, score it with the spoon or spatula in 
    crisscrossedfurrows about 1 inch apart.

6.  Allow the material to air dry, preferably in the sun.  As it dries, rescore
    it occasionally (about every 20 minutes) to aid drying.

7.  When the material has dried to a point to where it is moist and soft
    but not sticky to the touch, place a small spoonful on the screen.  Rub
    the aterial back and forth against the screen mesh with a spoon or other 
    flat object until the material is granulated into small worm-like 
    particles.

8.  After granulation, return the material to the sun to dry completely.

Procedure
---------

1.  Add 24 teaspoons of sulfuric acid to 16.5 teaspoons of nitric acid in the
    2 qt. jar.

2.  Place the jar in the pan (3-5 gallon) filled with cold water or in a stream
    and allow to cool.

3.  Rapidly swirl the jar to create a whirlpool in the liquid (without 
    splashing) while keeping the bottom portion of the jar in the water.

4.  While continually swirling, add to mixture, .5 teaspoon at a time, 13.5
    teaspoons of methyl alcohol, allowing the mixture to cool at least one
    minute between additions.

DANGER! PELIGRO!- If there is a sudden increase in the amount of fumes produced
of if the solution turns much darker or begins to froth, dump the solution in
the water within 10 seconds!  This will help lengthen your life, and prevent an
accident.

5.  After the final addition of methyl alcohol, swirl for another 35-40 
    seconds.

6.  Carefully pour the solution into one of the narrow glass jars.  Allow jar
    to stand in water for approx. 5 minutes until two layers separate.

7.  With an eyedropper or styringe, remove top layer and CAREFULLY put into 
    another narrow glass jar.  This liquid is the explosve.

Note: Thought I should tell you, this is shock sensitive. (very)

8.  Add an equal quantity of water to the explosive and swirl.  Allow mixture
    to separate again as in step 6.  The explosive is now the bottom layer.

9.  Carefully remove the top layer with the eyedropper or styringe and 
    discard.

10. Place one firmly packed cup of absorbent in the tray. 

11. While stirring with the wooden stick, slowly add explosive until the mass
    is very damp but not wet enough to drip.  Explosive is ready to use.

Note: If it gets too wet, add more absorbent.  If storage is required, store in
a sealed container to prevent evaporation.  Do not allow this to touch the 
skin.  If it does, flush with large quantities of water.  Keep grit, dirt, and
sand out of the mix.


How to Use
----------

1.  Spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap 
    threaded on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin
    can or a glass jar.

2.  Insert blasting cap just beneath the surfacr of the explosive mix.

Note: Confining the other end will add to the effectivenessof the explosive.

Procedure
---------

1.  Dilute 5 teaspoons of nitric acid with 2.5 teaspoons of clean water in a
    glass container by adding the acid to the water.

2.  Dissolve 1/8 teaspoon of mercury in the diluted nitric acid.  This will
    yield dark red fumes.

Note:  It may be necessary to add water, one drop at a time, to the 
mercury-acid solution in order to start reaction.  Also take usual precautions
when handling acid.

3.  Warm 10 teaspoons of the alcohol in a container until the alcohol feels 
    warm to the inside of the wrist.

4.  Pour the metal-acid solution into the warm alcohol.  Reaction should start
    in less than 5 minutes.  Dense white fumes will be given off during
    reaction.  As time lapses, the fumes will become less dense.  Allow 10
    to 15 minutes to complete reaction.  Fulminate will settle to bottom.

Note: This reaction generates large quantities of toxic, flammable fumes.  The
process must be conducted outdoors or in a well ventilated area, away from
sparks or flames.  Do not inhlale fumes unless you like death.

5.  Filter the solution through a paper towel into a container.  Crystals may
    stick to the side of the container.  If so, tilt and squirt water down the 
    sides of the container until all the material collects on the filter paper.

6.  Wash the crystals with 6 teaspoons of ethyl alcohol.

7.  Allow these to dry.

Note: Handle dry explosives with great care.  Do not scrape or handle it
roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flame.  Store in a cool dry place.

2.  Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture by placing its container in a larger one
    containing a mixture of ice, salt and water.

Note: Because of the lighter inner container being buoyant in the larger outer
container, it is necessary to secure it so that it will not fall over into the
ice, salt, and water mixture.  

3.  Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture to 5 degrees C.

4.  Add 2.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the acetone/peroxide mixture 
    slowly. drop by drop, with the use of an eye dropper.  Stir the mixture  
    during the addition of the sulfuric acid with a thermometer, keeping the 
    temperature between 5-10 degrees C., stop adding the sulfuric acid and    
    continue stirring until the temp. drops again to 5 degrees C., then
    continue adding the sulfuric acid.

5.  After all the sulfuric acid has been added, continue stirring the mixture 
    for another five minutes.

6.  Let the acetone/peroxide/sulfuric acid mixture stand in the ice/water/salt
    bath or remove the inner container and place it in an ice box for 12-24
    hours.

7.  After 12 hours, white crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of 
    the once clear solution.  Precipitation should be completed after 24 hrs.

Note: At this point the mixture is a primary explosive.  Keep away from shock,
friction and flame.

8.  Filter the mixture through a paper twoel into a container to collect all
    of the solid particles.

9.  Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel with small amounts 
    of ice cold water poured over them.  Discard the liquid in the container.

10. Place these explosive crystals in a container and allow to dry.

Note: Handle the dry explosive with great care.  Do not scrape or handle it
roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flame.  Store in a cool, dark, dry
place.

How to Use
----------

Acetone peroxide is a powerful initiator and can be used by itself as the main
filler when making homeade detonators.  Using 2.5" lengths of brass or copper
tubing with one end sealed shit with either solder or epoxy resin, begin by
partiallly filling the tube with acetone perroxide and compressing with a
loading press (Sec. VI, No. 13, Vol. 2 and Sec. II, No. 12, Vol 3).  Continue
This process until the explosive is within 1/2" of the top.  Cap the open end
tightly with a cork or wood stopper.  When ready to use, remove stopper and
insert time fuse.  Seal around fuse and tube insert into the main charge to a
depth of 2".  The caps will detonate most of the explosives shown in this
volume.

Note: These detonators should be used withing 7 days of thier manufacture and
should be stored in a cool, dry place.            



                                                            
Bullseye (low-high) Explosive                               Sec. I, No. 27

A highly effective and powerful low - high explosive can be obtained by simply
using a fast burning double-based, smokeless pistol powder called Bullseye. 
This propellant is used to reload pistol and revolver cartridges and contains a
sensitive mixture of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose.

                                                fine National Guard bases

How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a low explosive, simply pour the powder into a pipe with end caps
    and ignite with a time fuse.  When ignited, the pipe will explode into many
    fragments traveling at a velocity of approximately 600 fps.

2.  To use as a high explosive, simply pour the powder into a pipe with end 
    caps, insert a compound detonator with a fuzing mechanism and detonate.
    When detonated, the pipe will fragment into many small fragments traveling
    at a velocity in excess of 20,000 fps.

Note: Because of the unique mixture of nitroglycering with nitrocellulose
(double-base), Bullseye is one of the few propellants that can be detonated 
with a blasting cap.  When detonated, it is a powerful as military TNT and
should be used to defeat hard targets.

Potassium chlorate/Notrobenzene Explosive               Sec. I, No. 32

A moise explosive can be made from solid potassium chlorate and liquid
nitrobenzene.  This explosive has medium to high power and brisance.  It can be
used as a substitute for 50% ditching dynamite or flake TNT.  This exlosive can
be readily detonated by a standard blasting cap (No. 6).

Two flat boards (from No. 31)  

Blasting cap (No. 6)


Procedure
---------

1.  Use step one from No. 31 to pulverize the potassium chlorate.

Note: Nitrobenzene is extremely toxic and should be handled in well ventilated
areas.  Harmful effects may result from swallowing, inhalation of vapors, or
contact with the skin or eyes.  In case of accidental spilling, wash the
addected area immediately with large quantities of water.

2.  To produce the explosive, all that is required is to pour 1 part by volume,
    20% by weight of nitrobenzene into 4 parts by volume, 80% by weight, of 
    powdered potassium chlorate.  Stir until completely mixed, then store
    in a sealed container wintil ready for use.

3.  Another effective method in producing the explosive is to tightly pre-pack
    a selected charge container with powdered potassium chlorate.  When 
    ready for use, simply pour the pre-measured amount of nitrobenzene into the
    potassium chlorate and allow to soak for 3 to 3 minutes before using.

Note: An important factor to observe when pouring the nitrobenzene into the
potassium chlorate is to not allow the potassium chlorate to be disturbed after
it has been soaked with nitrobenzene.  Whenever a liquid is poured into a
powdered substance, a natural "caking action" will result, producing a fairly
uniform density throughout the solid material.  Since uniform density has a
direct overall effect on the explosive performance, it is important to first
pre-pack a rigid container with the potassium chlorate and then pour in the
nitrobenzene and allow it to soak in without stirring.  This will produce a 
high performance explosive.  Mixing in a plastic bag will produce a low
performance exlosive. 
    

How to Use
----------

1.  This mixture forms a very powerful explosive that can be used for general
    purpose blasting and ditching operations.  It is extremely sensitive to
    detonation and can be initiated by simple homemade detonators.

    or 2 parts by weight of nitromethane into 3 parts by volume or 5 parts by
    weight of powdered ammonium nitrate.  Stir until completely mixed, then
    store in a sealed container until ready to use.

3.  Another effective method in producing the explosive is to tightly pre-pack
    a selected charge container with powdered ammonium nitrate.  When ready
    to use, simply pour the pre-measured amount of nitromethane into the
    ammonium nitrate and allow to soak in for 3 to 5 minutes before using.

Note: An important factor to observe when pouring the nitromethane into the
ammonium nitrate is to not allow the ammonium nitrate to be disturbed after it
has been soaked with nitromethane.  Whenever a liquid is poured into a powdered
substance, a natural "caking action" will result, producing a fairly uniform
density throughout the solid material.  Since uniform density has a direct
overall effect of the explosive performance, it is important to first pre-pack 
a rigid container with ammonium nitrate and then pour in the nitromethane and
allow to soak without stirring.  This will produce a high performance 
explosive.  Mixing in a plastic bag will produce a low performance explosive.


How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive is one of the most powerful/brisant two component explosives
    readily available.  Each component is perfectly safe to handle by itself.
    However, when the two are mixed together, they form a sensitive high 
    explosive that can be detonated with a standard blasting cap.

2.  This explosive mixture should be used to defeat hard targets, such as steel
    and reinforced concrete.  It can also be used with special charges that
    require high brisance, i.e., shaped charges, platter charges, and SCIMP
    charges.




Nitromethane Liquid explosive                               Sec. I, No. 35

A liquid explosive, that resembles water in appearance, can be made from
nitromethane and aqueous ammonia (household glass cleaner).  This exposive is 
22 to 24 more powerful that military TNT and can be detonated with a standard
blasting cap.  However, to achieve maximum velocity, a compound detonator 
should be used.

Procedure
---------

Note: Nitromethane is a common chemical reagent, and under normal conditions
cannot be made to detonate even if a strong detonator is used.  However, if
certain ammonia-containing compounds (called sensitizers) are alled in small
percentages (5-6 %), then the sensitized nitromethane can be detonated with a
standard #8 blasting cap.  The most effective sensitizers are aniline and
ethylenediamine.  The most readily available sensitizer is common household
glass cleaner (aqueous ammonia).

1.  To produce the explosive, simply pour the sensitizer into the nitromethane
    and mix thoroughly.  One-half pic sensitizer will sensitize one gallon of
    nitromethane.

2.  The explosive can be premixed, or for safety's sake, it can be mixed just
    prior to use by prefilling a charge container with nitromethane and then 
    adding the sensitizer when ready to detonate.


How to Use
----------

1.  This liquid explosive can be used whenever or wherever a liquid can be 
    used for disguiseability.  It can be poured directly into prefabricated
    special charge containers, i.e., shape charges, platter charges, and SCIMP
    charges, without special measures being taken to maintain uniform densities
    required for solid explosives to be effective.

2.  To obtain the maximum efficiency, a compound detonator should be used for 
    initiation.  Reliability of initiation is increased by positioning and 
    immersing the detonator centrally with respect to the wall of the
    container.  By centrally positioning and immersing the detonator in the
    liquid, the output energy of the detonator is transmitted to the 
    explosive instead of being partially dissipated through the wall of the
    container.

Fertilizer/hydrazine liquid explosive                       Sec. I, No. 36

A liquid explosive can be made from solid ammonium nitrate fertilizer combined
with liquid anhydrous hydrazine.  This liquid explosive is more powerful and
brisant than C4 plastic explosive and can be used as a direct replacement for
C4.  This explosive can be detonated with a blasting cap.  However, to achieve
maximum velocity a compound detonator should be used.

Procedure
---------

Note:  Anhydrous hydrazine is classified as as corrosive and is flammable. 
Keep away from spark or flame.  It is also mildly toxic and should be handled 
in well ventilated areas.  Affected areas of skin should be washed with large
quantities of water.

1.  Pour into the mixing container an amount of anhydrous hydrazine equal to 
    the amount of explosive required.

2.  Ammonium nitrate (prilled or powdered) is then added, a teaspoon at a
    time, to the hydrazine in the mixing container.

Note: The mixing container should be fairly large (5x the volume of the
hydrazine) because the chemical reaction between the ammonium nitrate and the
hydrazine is extremely effervescent and can easily bubble over the top.

3.  Because of the effervescent reaction, the ammonium nitrate should be added
    very slowly so as not to create accidental over-flowing.  With each 
    addition of ammonium nitrate, the person doing the mixing should wait for
    the initial reaction to subside, then stir the solution until all of the
    ammonium nitrate dissolves into it.

Note: The reaction between the ammonium nitrate and hydrazine liberates large
volumes of poisonous gas.  The person doing the mixing should be upwind of the
mixing process so as not to breath the poisonous fumes.

4.  The  mixing process is continued until the ammonium nitrate no longer 
    dissolves into the solution, even after five minutes of stirring, and a 
    small amount reamains undissolved at the bottom of the mixing container.
    This undissolved ammonium nitrate does not affect the performance of the
    explosive.

5.  After the mixing process is complete, what will remain will be a clear
    liquid explosive more powerful and brisant that any military explosive.

Note: The mixed explosive has a lower toxicity of the hydrazine.  However, it 
is recommended that the same handling precautions be observed.

6.  To make an even more powerful explosive, 20% aluminum powder (100 mesh or
    finer) can be added to the ammonium nitrate  before mixing with the 
    hydrazine (it does not react with the other two ingredients), or ir can
    be added after the mixing process is complete. 

How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive is the most powerful/brisant of the two complement explosive
    systems available.  It can be used whenever or wherever a liquid can be 
    used for disguiseability.

2.  It can be poured directly into prefabricated special charge containers,
    i.e., shape, platter and SCIMP charges, without special measures being
    taken to maintain uniform densities required by solid explosives to be
    effective.

3.  It has unique absorption and retention poperties which can be used to
    create a liquid land mine.  The liquid explosive can be poured directly
    into the ground, soaking into and blending with the surrounding earth.
    The pocket of explosive can be initiated by a conventional electrically
    or mechanically actuated detonator.  These pockets of explosives have 
    remained detonable for four days in the ground, even when the soil was
    soaked due to rainy weather.

Explosive paper                                             Sec I, No. 37

An excellent absorption explosive can be made from a solution of PETN (the
center filler of detonator cord), acetone, and mineral oil.  When any non-gloss
paper, i.e., newspaper, paperback books, corrugated cardboard, etc., is dipped
in this explosive solution and then removed and allowed to dry, the paper will
retain its original texture and appearance along with a microcrystaline high
explosive incorporated into the fiber content of the paper.  This produces a
disguised explosive that can be carried into a target area without arousing
suspicion.

Procedure
---------

1.  Using a razor blade, cut detonating cord lengthwise and remove the center
    filler (P.E.T.N.).  Approx. .5 lb. of PETN can be removed per 100 ft. 
    of detonating cord.

2.  Fill a canning jar 2/3 full of acetone and heat until mildly warm by 
    placing the canning jar in a pan or bucket on heat source when it contains 
    the canning jar.

3.  Add PETN to the acetone, a tablespoon a a time, while stirring with a 
    stirring rod.  Stir the solution until the PETN dissolves.  Add more PETN
    until it no longer dissolves into solution, even after five minutes of 
    stirring.  Approx. 1/3 lb. of PETN will dissolve in every lb. of warm
    acetone used.

4.  Approx. 2% mineral should be added to the final solution.  This mineral
    oil will prevent the crystals of PETN from recrystalizing to a noticeable
    size when the acetone evaporates.  The mineral oil will also provide a 
    better texture to the paper when it is dry after the soaking process.

5.  Pout this solution into a large, flat pam, then fill the pan with even
    sheets of a non gloss paper.  It rolled newspaper is used, unroll it and
    lay it out evenly in the an.  Allow the paper to soak for 30 minutes.

6.  After soaking for 30 minutes, remove the paper and allow to dry for at 
    least 24 hours.  DO NOT DRY IN AN OVEN.  After the papr has had time to 
    dry, 50 % of its weight will consist of a microcrystaline high explosive
    intimately incorporated into the fiber content of the paper.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use simply insert a blasting cap ot compound detonator into the paper
    and detonate.

2.  If a rolled newspaper is used, the detonator and fusing mechanism  can
    be concealed in the center of the roll and easily carried into the 
    target area and left where destruction is desired.  An average size 
    newspaper has the explosive equivalent of several sticks of dynamite.

Procedure
---------


1.  Place .5 cup, 120 ml or cc of nitrix acid in a large canning jar and bring
    the temperature to between 20 and 30 degrees C. (68-86 F)  By putting the
    jar in a basin of cold water.  If necessary, swirl the canning jar around
    the basin of cold water to bring the temperature down, while being careful
    not to allow any water to splash into the acid.

Note:  Maintain the thermometer in the acid throughout the reaction while
carefully noting and controlling the temperature by alternating the jar between
the basin of cold water and the basin of hot water.  The thermometer can be 
used as a stirring rod if the solution is gently stirred.

2.  Weigh or measure out 70 grams by weight, 18 teaspoons by volume, of the 
    hexamine and start adding the salt-like hexamine slowly, 1/2 teaspoon
    at a time, during a 15 minute period.  Maintain the temp. between 20 - 30
    degrees C, while stirring gently with the thermometer.  Control the temp.
    by dipping the canning jar in and out of the basin filled with cold water.

3.  When all of the hexamine is dissolved in the acid, heat the solution to
    55 degrees C, by placing the canning jar in a bsin of hot water.  Maintain
    tis temperature for about 10 minutes.

4.  After heating the solution for 10 minutes, remove the canning jar from
    the basin of cold water and place it in the basin of cold water.  Cool the
    canning jar to 20 degrees C. (68 degrees F).

5.  When the temperature has reached 20 degrees C, add 3 cups (750 ml) of
    cold water to the solution and a white salt will appear.

Note:  The white salt is RDX and should be handled with great care from now on.

6.  Filter the acid/water/RDX solution through a paper towel covering the
    mouth of another jar.

7.  Wash the RDX crystals off the paper towel and into a canning jar, using
    an additional 3 cups of fresh, cold water.  Add a teaspoon of sodium 
    carbonate to neutralize the acid and stir rapidly for 2-3 minutes, then
    filter again.

8.  The crude product can be dried out on the paper towel filter.  It is 
    suitable for fairly immediate use, or it can be purified.

9.  To purify RDX, fill a quart canning jar 2/3 full of acetone.  Heat the
    acetone by placing the jar in a basin of hot simmering water, then add
    RDX, a tablespoon at a time, until it completely dissolves in the 
    acetone.

10. After the maximem amount of RDX has been dissolved into the hot acetone,
    allow the solution to cool to room temperature, then let stand for one
    more hour.

11. The RDX will form a salt once again.  Filter the RDX and spread it out on
    a paper towel as before.

12. The purified RDX should be stored in a clean canning jar with a tight
    fitting lid.  It can be stored for months without loss of effectiveness.

Note: RDX is not too sensitive to heat and shock, but is fairly sensitive to
friction.  Care should therefore be taken when the explosive is to be packed or
when the dry explosive is handled.  Using the amounts of chemicals listed in
this article, the yield of RDX should be about 1/5 oz.





Explosive Flour                                             Sec. I, No. 39

An explosive that looks and bakes like ordinary wheat flour can be made from a
mixture flour and RDX.  It can be used in many different forms as an explosive:
in its dry powder form, moistened with water and used as a dough like plastic
explosive, or by using special recipes it can be baked into pancakes or 
bisuits.

large sheet of wood, and a rolling pin
(wood must be flat)


Procedure
---------

1.  Place a tablespoonful of RDX crystals on the large sheet of wood.  Using
    a rolling pic, crush the crystals into a fine powder, the consistency of
    flour.

Note:  Use only a rolling pic, not a block of wood.  It is important to crush
the RDX crystals into a fine powder rather than using friction between to
rubbing surfaces.

2.  Mix 80% by weight of powdered RDX with 20% by weight of flour in a canning
    jar with a tight fitting lid by shaking for five minutes.

3.  The mixed explosive flour can be stored in the sealed mixing conainer for
    long periods of time before using.  It can also be disguised by storing
    it in an original bag of flour.


How to Use
----------

1.  This explosive flour is more powerful and brisant that military TNT and
    is easiest to detonate in its powdered form.  A standard blasting cap 
    provides sufficient shock to set it off.

2.  To use as a plastic explosive, mix 4 parts by weight of flour to 1 part
    by weight of water.  This forms a dough that has very desirable plastic 
    qualities which can be used to mold itself around vertain types of
    targets in the same manner as military C4 plastic explosive.  A compound
    detonator must be use to insure positive detonation.

3.  The following recipes make it possible to bake the powdered explosive into
    pancakes or biscuits:

    A.  For pancakes, use this recipe:

        3 cups explosive flour
        2 teaspoons of baking powder
       .5 teaspoon of salt
        1 cup of milk
        1 egg
        2 tablespoons of melted lard

Note: This pancake mixture can be left of the griddle until it completely chars
with no unusual effects,  thus demonstrating the stability of the mixture to
heat.

    B.  For explosive biscuits, use this recipe:

        3 cups explosive flour
        2 teaspoons of baking powder
      3/8 teaspoon of salt
        2 teaspoons of lard
       88 ml or cc of water

4.  The finished pancakes and biscuits look, feel, and taste like ordinary
    pancakes and biscuits.  However, they are highly toxic, and SHOULD NOT
    BE EATEN.  Before using these baked items as an explosive, they must be 
    moistened and kneaded into a plastic masss to remove the air spaces.  
    They may be exploded in the same manner as the plastic form.                                                                                    
Pipe Hand Grenade                                           Sec. II, No. I

Hand grenades can be made from a piece of iron pipe.  The filler can be plastic
or granular military explosive, improvised explosive, or propellant from
shotgunn or small arms ammunition.

Procedure
---------

1.  Place blasting cap on one end of fuse cord and crimp with pliers. 
    

Note:  To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time it takes 
for a known length of fuse to burn.  If 12 inches burns in 30 seconds, a six
inch cord will ignite the grenade in 15 seconds.

2.  Screw pipe cap to one end of pipe.  Place fuse cord with blasting cap into
    the opposite end so that the blasting cap is near the center of the pipe.

Note:  If plastic explosive is to be used, fill pipe before inserting blasting
cap.  Push a round stick into the center of the exlosive to make a hole and 
then insert blasting cap.

3.  Pour exlposive or propellant into pipe a little at a time.  Tap the base 
    of the pipe frequently to settle filter.

4.  Drill a hole in the center of the unassembled pipe cap large enough
    for the fuse cord to pass through.

5.  Wipe pipe threads to remove any filler material.  Slide the drilled pipe
    cap over the fuse and screw handtight onto pipe.

tap, string, wire or glue


Procedure
---------

1.  If an explosive charge other than a standard TNT block is used, make
    a hole in the center of the charge for inserting the blasting cap.  TNT
    can be drilled with relative safety.  With plastic explosives, a hole can
    be made by pressing a round stick into the center of the charge.  The hole
    should be deep enough that the blasting cap is totally within the
    explosive.

2.  Tape, tie or glue on or two rows of closely packed nails to sides of 
    explosive block.  Nails should completely cover the four surfaces of the 
    block. 

3.  Place blasting cap on one end of the fuse cord and crimp with pliers.

Note: Use same method in Sec. II, No. 1 to determine burning lengths of fuse.

4.  Insert the blasting cap in the hole in the block of explosive.  Tape or tie
    fuse cord securly in place so that it will not fall out when the grenade 
    is thrown.


Alternate Use
-------------

An effective directional anti-personnel mine can be made by placing nails on
only one side of the explosive block.  For this case, an electric blasting cap
should be used.

Procedure
---------

1.  Soak a piece of string in gasoline or kerosene.  Double wrap this
    string around the wine bottle approx. 3 in. above the top of the cone.

Note: Adding a small amount of motor oil to the gasoline or kerosene will
improve results.

2.  Ignite the string and allow to burn for 1 to 2 minutes.  Then plunge the

    and discarded.

3.  If plastic explosive is used:

    A.  Pack explosive into the bottle a little at a time compressing with
        a wooden rod.  Fill the bottle up to the top.

    B.  Press a .25 in. wooden dowel .5 in into the middle of the top of 
        the explosive charge to form a hole for the blasting cap.

4.  If TNT or other castable explosive is used:

    A.  Break explosive into small pieces using a wooden mallet or non-
        sparking metal tools.  Place pieces in a tin can.    
                                               
    B.  Suspend this can in a larger container which is partly filled with
        water.  A stiff wire or stick pushed through the smaller can will
        accomplish this.

Note:  The inner can must not rest on the bottom of the outer container.

    C.  Heat the containr on a electric hot plate or other heat source.  Stir
        the explosive frequently with a wooden stick while it is melting.

Note: Keep area well ventilated while melting explosive.  Fumes may be
poisonous.

    D.  When all the explosive has melted, remove the inner container and 
        stir the molten explosive until it begins to thicken.  Diring this
        time the bottom half of the wine bottle should be placed in the
        container of hot water.  This will pre-heat the bottle so that it
        will not crack whenthe explosive is poured.

    E.  Remove the bottle from how water and dry thoroughly.  Pour molten
        explosive into the bottle and allow to cool.  The crust which
        forms on top of the charge during cooling should be broken with a
        wooden stick and more explosive added.  Do this as often as necessary 
        until the bottle is filled to the top.

    F.  When explosive has completely hardened, bore a hole for the blasting
        cap in the middle of the top of the charge about .5 in. deep.


How to Use
----------

1.  Place blasting cap in the hole in the top of the charge.  If non-electric
    blasting cap is used, be sure cap is crimped around fuze and fuze is 
    long enough to provide safe delay.

2.  Place the charge so that the bottom is 3-4 in. from the target.  This can
    be done by taping legs to the charge or any other convenient means as 
    long as there is nothing between the base of the charge and the target.

3.  If electric blasting cap is used, connect blasting wires to firing
    circuit.

Note: The effectiveness of this charge can be increased by placing it inside a
can, box, or similar container and packing sand or dirt between the charge and
the container.

    A.  Place the pipe in the vise and cut pipe in half lengthwise.  Remove the
        pipe half sections from the vise.

    B.  Discard one of the pipe half sections, or save for another charge.

2.  Place angle or pipe half section with open end face down on a flat surface.

3.  Make container from any material available.  The container must be as wide
    as the angle or pipe half section, twice as high, and as long as the 
    desired cut to be made with the charge.

4.  Place container over the liner (angle or pipe half section) and tape liner
    to container.

5.  If plastic explosive is used, fill the container with the explosive 
    ising small quantities, and tamp with wooden rod or stick.

Note: If castable explosive is used, refer to step 4 of Sec. II, No. 3.

6.  Cut wooden rod to lengths 2 inches longer than the standoff length (see 
    table).  Postition the rods at the corners of the explosive filled 
    container and hold in place with tape.

Note: The position of the rods on the container must conform to standoff and
penetration dimensions given in the table.

7.  Make a hole for blasting cap in the side od the container .5 in. above the
    liner and centered with the wooden rod.

Note: Do not place blasting cap inside Linear Shaped Charge until ready to
detonate.


How to Use
----------

1.  Place blasting cap into hole on the side of the container.  If non-electric
    cap is used, be sure cap is crimped around fuse and fuse is long enough.

2.  Place (tape if necessary) the LSC on the target so that nothing is between 
    base of charge and target.

3.  If electric cap is used, connect cap wires to firing circuit.

Notes:  1.  Block- wood (10" x 10" x 6" or steel (6" x 6" x 6") with 3/8" 
            diameter hole 1" deep.

        2.  1/4"  O.D. hard brass or wood ram 

Note:  The loading press is provided with a protective barrier and a remote
system of rope and pulley operation to provide operator safety during loading. 
Only wood and spark-proof (brass) metals are used near the exlosive.

CAUTION:  Making detonators is hazardous business that can be made safe by
taking certain precautions.  Operations must be performed slowly and with great
care.  Cleanliness is important.  Dirt in the explosive or containers will
greatly increase sensitivity to detonation by impact or shock.  If possible the
air should be moist.  Boil a bucket of water in the room before starting to 
work if the air is dry.  When inserting and removing the ramrod and when
carrying primary explosives, use tongs or pliers.  If possible, uuse only one
hand at a time when handling the primary explosive in the loading process and
wear protective goggles at all times.

2.  With the arrangement shown on the preceeding page, the pressure applied
    to the exlosive inside the shell casing will be about 200x the force 
    applied to the end of the lever.  That is, a 20 pound weight pulling at
    at the handle will compress the explosive with a press of 4,000 lbs. of
    pressure per sq. in.  This pressure is required for the best sensitivity 
    of mercury fulminate.  A 2.5 gallon bucket of water weighs about 20 lbs.

3.  Light a candle and let two drops of wax drop into the bottom of each 
    shell casing before using.

4.  Allow the wax to cool, then insert the shell casing into the loading 
    block.

5.  Fill the shell casing to a depth of 1/4 in. with RDX or PETN secondary
    explosive.  Gently insert the ram.

6.  Compress the explosive slowly and evenly by pulling on the rope until the
    weight leaves the ground.  Remove the ram carefully.

7.  Continue the adding and pressing operation until a column of secondary 
    explosive 5/8 inch high has been pressed into the 1 inch long shell 
    casing.

8.  Add a small quantity of primary explosive on top of the secondary 
    explosive and gently insert the ram.

9.  Continue the adding and pressing operation until an additional 1/4 inch
    column of primary explosive has been pressed on top of the 5/8 inch column
    of secondary explosive.

10. Gently compress the remaining 1/8 inch of empty space with an igniter of
    either black powder or smokeless pistol powder.

11. Seal the top with either tape or wax paper held in place with a small
    rubber band until ready to use.

Note: When inserting the detonator into a selected hand grenade, be careful not
to tilt the detonator and let the igniter charge spill out.  Instead, place the
grenade over the detonator and lower it until the detonator is sealed into
place, then invert the genade and fill with explosive.

   



Cigarette Lighter Hand Grenade                              Sec. II, No. 13
                                                            
An effective and powerful miniature hand grenade can be made from a Zippo brand
cigarette lighter, any homemade explosive and a mini-compound detonator (Sec.
II, No. 12).  This explosive device can be used either as a hand grenade or a
boobytrap.

Materials
---------

Any powerful homemade explosive, i.e., potassium chlorate/nitrobenzene (Sec. I,
No. 32), ammonium nitrate/nitromethane (Sec. I, No. 34), etc.

Mini-Compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12)

Black powder (Sec. I, No. 3)

Zippo cigarette lighter, approx. 2 1/4" length x 1 1/2" Diam., or larger 

Copper and brass tubing 9/32" diameter x 12" long

hacksaw

small mixing bowl

epoxy resin


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a zippo lighter with outer case dimensions of approx. 2 1/4 long x
    1 1/2" wide x 1/2" deep.  Separate the inner lighter mechanism from the 
    outer casing and remove all the cotton wadding.

2.  Remove the cotton ignition wick and convert it into a black powder time
    fuse by the following steps:

    A.  Place a couple of tablespoons of black powder (sec. I, No. 3) into a
        small mixing bowl and add enough water until it looks like a heavy
        oil.

    B.  The cotton wick is placed in the oil-like mixture and stirred
        for 15 minutes so that it becomes saturated with the black 
        powder mix.

    C.  The cotton wick is removed and hung to dry for four hours.

    D.  This mixture fuse was found to have a burning rate of 1.3 seconds
        per inch.

Note: Be sure and test burning time on a similar wick before using.  If a new
Zippo lighter is used, it is necessary to use the lighter approx. 25 times
before disassembling.  This will make the lighter appear used and will blacken
the cotton ignition wick which will help disguise the black powder time fuse
that will be reinserted.

3.  Reinsert the cotton wick fuse through the wick hole and leave enough fuse 
    in the ignition chamber so that it can easily bepulled from the igniter.

Note: Knot the end of the fuse inside the lighter sothat it won't pull free
later when using.

4.  Using a hacksaw, cut a one inch length from a 9/32" diameter piece
    of copper or brass tubing.

5.  Insert this one inch tube over the wick hole and use a 1/8" layer of 
    epoxy resin or other strong glue to seal in place.

6.  Insert a mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12) into the holding
    tube inside the lighter.

Caution:  The mini-compound detonator is a sensitive and extremely powerful
detonator and should be handled carefully at all times.

7.  Fill the remaining space to within 1/8" of the bottom with any homemade 
    explosive this manual.

Note: The explosive can be loaded in first, and when ready to use, simply 
insert the detonator.  When using potassium chlorate or ammonium nitrate for a
base explosive, load the cigarette lighter with either base explosive and 
insert the detonator.  When ready to use, simply pour in the liquid activator 
of either nitromethane or nitrobenzene.

8.  After filling to within 1/8" in. of the bottom with explosive, cut off a 
    1/8" strip from the original cotton wadding and insert in the bottom of 
    the lighter to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a hand grenade, simply pull out a length of fuse and ignite
    with a separate cigarette lighter or match.

2.  To use as a boobytrap, insert the lighter, with a short fuse, into the
    target area.




Shotgun shell impact grenade                                Sec. II, No. 14

An effective and powerful impact grenade can be made from a 12 gauge shotgun
shell, any homemade high explosive and a mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No.
12).  This explosive devise can be used as an impact grenade or as a boobytrap.

Materials
---------

Any homemade explosive, i.e., potassium chlorate/nitrobenzene (Sec. I, No. 32),
ammonium nitrate/nitromethane (Sec. I, No. 34), etc.

Mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, NO. 12)

12 gauge shotgun shell   
         
wood dowel or steel bar 11/16" in diameter and any length beyond 1/2"

hacksaw

drill w/ 1/4" bit

pieces of cloth, 12" x 12"

epoxy resin or strong glue

steel ball bearings 3/8" in diameter

electrical tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Either cut off or open up the forward end of any 12 gauge shotgun shell and
    empty out the shot, wadding, spacer and propellant.  Retain the shell
    casing.

2.  In order for the mini-detonator to be over the center of the primer, a
    detonator guide cylinder has to be made from either a piece of bar
    steel or a wooden dowel in the following manner:

    A.  Using a hacksaw, cut a 1/2" length of 11/16" steel bar or wooden
        dowel.

    B.  Drill a 1/4" diameter hole in the center of the 1/2 long wood or 
        metal cylinder.

Note: It is preferred that a steel cylinder be used in ot to lend more weight 
to the base of the shell case.

3.  After the guide cylinder is prepared, it is glued in place in the bottom
    of the shotshell case.

Note: Do not place any glue on the primer in the base of the shell casing.

4.  The mini-compound detonator (Sec. II, No. 12) is the inserted, open end
    down, into the guide cylinder and glued in place.

Caution: The mini-compound detonator is a sensitive and extremely powerful
detonator and should be handled carefully at all times.

5.  Fill the remaining space in the shotshell case with any homemade high
    explosive in this manual.

Note: When using potassium chlorate or ammonium nitrate for a base explosive,
load the shotshell case with either base explosive.  When ready to use, simply
pour in the liquid activator of either nitromethane/nitrobenzene.

6.  After the top of the shotshell has been resealed, tape a 3/8" steel ball 
    bearing in place over the center of the primer in the base of the shell.

7.  Cloth streamers (12" x 1/2") are then taped in place around the shotshell.
    These streamers lend stability in flight and insure bottom base impact with
    the ground.

8.  As a further refinement, nails can be taped around the shotshell case
    with ntches, spaced 1/4" apart, down the length of the shell.


How to Use
----------

1.  To use as a grenade, simply throw into the target area.

2.  To use as a boobytrap, do not attach streamers or the ball bearing.  
    Simply insert the shotshell case into the target area.

Platter Charge                                              Sec. II, No. 15

An extremely effective directional charge can be made from a steel pipe cap, 
any high explosive, and a tin can.  This charge is effective against such
targets as transformers, generators, fuel storage containers and vehicles.  It
can be fired horizontally or used as an improvised land mine and fired
vertically.

Materials
---------

Steel pipe cap with a diameter between 1" and 24"

Tin can or other similar container with an inside diameter being the same as 
the steel pipe cap

sheet of wood 1" thick

steel pipe cap, (between 1 - 2" in diameter) and a piece of pipe, (approx. 2" 
in length

drill with 1/4" bit

Solid or liquid high explosive, i.e., nitromethane/ammonium nitrate explosive
(Sec. I, No. 34), fertilizer/hydrazine explosive (Sec. I, No. 36), or
nitromethane liquid explosive (Sec. I, No. 35)

blasting cap


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a steel pipe cap.  An ideal diameter would be 6 - 12".  However, 
    pipe caps as small as 1" may be used.

2.  Locate a coffee can or similar container with an inside diameter the same 
    as the outside diameter of the pipe cap.  Remove the lid (do not throw 
    away) and empty the contents of the can and clean it out.

3.  Place the pipe cap in the bottom of the can with the concave side 
    facing the bottom of the can.
        
4.  An exact center priming disk must be made from a 1" thick piece of wood in
    the following manner:

    A.  Using the coffee can lid from step 2 as a template, place it on a 
        sheet of wood 1" thick and mark the outside diameter with a pencil.

    B.  Using a saw, cut the disk out of the sheet of wood.  After cutting
        the disk out, drill a 1/4" hole through the exact center.  If this
        priming disk is to be used as a packing tool for the solid explosive,
        center sink the 1/4" center hole to fit the head of a 1/4" bolt.  
        Set the disk aside for later use.

5.  If a solid explosive is being used. the following constructon technique
    should be used:

    A.  Using the center priming disk prepared from step 4, a uniform packing
        tool can be prepared by the addition of a 1/4" nut and bolt, a steel
        pipe cap and a piece of pipe.

    B.  Carefully pack an amount of solid explosive equal to the weight of
        the pipe cap around and behind the pipe cap using the packing tool.
        For example, if the pipe cap weighs five pounds, use five pounds of
        solid explosive.

Note: For this charge to be effective, it is necessary to uniformly pack the
explosive behind the pipe cap with no air gaps.

    C.  After the explosive has been loaded into the tin can behind the 
        inverted pipe cap, disassemble the packing tool and place the priming
        disk over the ompressed explosive.  Seal the inside edges with glue,
        wax, or tar.  The discarded pipe handle and cap can be used later to 
        form a pipe hand grenade (Sec. II, No. 1)

Note: The wood priming disk prepared in step 4 has three ain uses: as a packing
tool for solid explosive, as a lid to keep the explosve from falling out of the
conainer, and as a template that insures exact rear center priming of the
charge.

    D.  After the priming disk has been sealed in place, insert a blasting cap
        through the center hole and into the solid explosive to a depth of
        3/4".  Seal around the cap with glue, wax or tar.

6.  When using a liquid explosive, an easier construction method may be
    used:

    A.  When ready to use, simply pour in an amount of liquid exlosive equal
        to the weight of the pipe cap and seal in place the wood priming disk
        prepared instep 4.

    B.  Insert a blasting cap through the center hole and into the liquid 
        explosive to a depth of 3/4".  Seal around the blasting cap with 
        glue, wax, or tar.

7.  If a coffee can was used in the construction, there should still be 
    sufficient room inside the can for a fuzing mechanism, i.e., a wrist
    watch delay timer with battery (Sec. VI, No. 4), or a small remote
    control radio reciever.

Note: A second disguise can be achieved by inseting a third disk covering the
fizing mechanism, sealing around the edges of the disk and then pouring coffee
into the can until full.  Place the plastic sealing lid over the top of the can
to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  The unique capability of this charge is that it can be fired through a
    chain link fence and into its target without any loss of effectiveness.
    At close range the platter will penetrate about one inch of mild steel
    plate.  It is effective at ranges up to 100 feet or more, although at
    this distance penetration is reduced to about 1/4" of mild steel at best
    and sighting becomes a problem unless the target is a very large one.

2.  Upon detonation, the platter is projected forward at tremendous velocity.
    The air in front of the platter is compressed and becomes superheated.  It
    is this mass of air, moving at extremely high velovity, that first 
    penetrates the target.  The platter follows and may indeed strike the
    target, but research has shown that the primary destruction effect is
    created by the compacted high velocity air column.





SCIMP (Special Charge Improvised Projectile) charge         Sec. II, No. 16

Using materials that are readily available in its construction, this mine will
defeat almost any target that is mad-made, i.e., tanks, armored cars, 
buildings, etc.  This charge is four times for effective than any other
directional charge, to include shaped and platter charges.  This directional
charge utilizes two special techniques to achieve its effectiveness; one is
sandwiching an explosive charge between two steel plates, and the other 
involves detonating this charge from all sides at the same time (periphreal
detonation).

Materials
---------

oil filter cap or other similar steel dish

No. 6 sheet metal screws, 1" long

steel plate, 1/8" thick

Solid or liquid high explosive, i.e., fertilizer/nitromethane,
fertilizer/hydrazine liquid explosive, and nitromethane liquid explosive

wood or styrofoam sheets, 1" thick

blasting cap

coffee can or other similar container

drill with 1/4" bit


Procedure
---------

1.  Obtain a concave steel dish, 3" to 12" in diameter: for example, by 
    removing the center retaining bolt from any two piece oil filter assy.
    and using the oil filter cap (an oil filter from a 1951-53 chevy, with
    a diameter of 5 1/4" is ideal).

2.  Plug the bolt hole in the center of the cap with wood, rubber, or cork
    stopper.

3.  Using the oil filter cap as a template, place it on a sheet of steel 
    1/8" thick and mark the outside diameter with a pencil.

4.  Using a hacksaw, cut the disk out of the plate.

5.  Repear steps 3 and 4, cutting out two disks from a 1" thick sheet of wood
    or styrofoam.

6.  Take the three disks (one steel and the other two wood or styrofoam) and
    glue them together with the steel disk on one side.  Set aside for later 
    use.

7.  Locate a coddee can or similar container with an inside diameter 1/4" to 
    1/2" larger that the outside diameter of the filter ca.  Remove the lid 
    (do not throw away) and empty and clean the can.

8.  Using the coffee can lid as a template, repeat steps 3 and 4 on a 1"
    thick sheet of wood, and after cutting the disk out, drill a 1/4" hole
    in the exact center and set aside for later use.

9.  Place the oil can filter cap in the bottom center of the coffee can
    and glue in place with the concave cap facing towards the bottom of the
    cap.

                 |-------------------------------|   


10. If a solid explosive is being used, the following construction
    technique should be used:

    A.  Mark two rings around the inside of the coffee can; one 3" from the
        bottom of the can, and the second 5 5/8" from the bottom of the can.

    B.  Carefully pack the explosive uniformly around the filter cap until
        it reaches the 3" mark inside the can.

Note: The 1" thick wood disk prepared from step 8 can be used as a uniform
packing tool by attaching an improvised handle using a piece of pipe, two pipe
caps and a 1/4" nut and bolt.

    C.  After reaching the 3" mark inside the can, place the three later disk
        assy. (prepared in step 6) on top of the compressed explosive.  
        Center it with the steel disk on the explosive. 
    
    D.  Carefully pack the explosive between the inside edge of the can and
        the edge of the three layer disk assy. until the explosive level is
        even with the top of the disk.

    E.  Carefully pack an additional 1/2" layer of explosive on top of the 
        last styrofoam or wood disk.  This layer should reach the second ring 
        marked inside the can.

Note: Again the wood disk/pipe packing tool can be used to compress the
remaining explosive on top of the charge.

    F.  Disassemble the wood disk/pipe packing tool by removing the center nut
        and bolt that holds the two together.  Save and use the pipe for a 
        future pipe hand grenade (Sec. II, No. 1).

    G.  Place the 1" thick wood packing disk on top of the explosive contained
        inside the can and seal with glue, wax or tar.

    H.  When ready to use, insert a 1/4" blasting cap through the center hole
        in the wood disk and into the 1/2" layer of explosive.

Note: The wood disk prepared from step 8 has three main uses; a packing tool, a
lid to prevent the explosive from falling out of the container, and a template
that insures rear center priming of the charge.

11. When using a liquid explosive, a slightly different and easier 
    construction method is used:  

    A.  Mark two rings around the inside of the can; one 5 1/8" from the
        bottom of the can and the second 6 5/8 from the bottom of the can.

    B.  Place the top of the three layer disk assy. at the level of the first
        ring marked inside the can and secure in place with four No. 6 sheet
        metal screws spaced wvery 90 degrees around the outside of the coffee
        can and screwed into the center of the center disk assy.  Since the
        disk assy. is smaller than the inside diameter of the coffee can, it 
        can be held in place by inserting 1/4" wood dowels between the can and
        the assy.  When the four supporting screws have been screwed into
        place, the wooden dowels can be removed.

    C.  Place the remaining 1" thick wood disk, prepared from step 8, at
        the level of the second ring marked inside the can and secure
        in place with four more No. 6 sheet metal screws spaced every 90
        degrees around the outside of the can.  Seal the inside edges with
        wax, glue or tar.

    D.  When ready to use, simply pour the liquid explosive through the
        center hole until fill.  Insert a blasting cap through the hole and
        into the 1/2" layer of liquid explosive.  Seal around the hole and
        blasting cap with glue, wax, or tar.

12. If a coffee can was used in the construction, there should still be
    sufficient room inside the can for a fuzing mechanism, i.e., a watch
    delay timer with batteries (Sec. IV, No. 4), or a small remote control
    radio reciever.

13. After the fuzing mechanism has been inserted, the original metal lid
    that was removed and set aside ealier is now glued inside the plastic
    sealing lid that comes with most coffee cans and snapped back in place 
    on top of the can.  The whole charge then resembles an ordinary coffee can.

Note: A second disguise can be achieved by inserting a third disk covering the
fuzing mechanism, sealing around the edges of the disk and the pouring coffee
back into the can until full.  Place the plastic sealing lid over the top of 
the can to complete the disguise.


How to Use
----------

1.  The SCIMP charge should be used when direct access to the target it not
    possible, i.e., under or beside a roadway or hanging on a fence looking
    into the target area.

2.  The applications are very similar to a platter charge with the exception
    that the SCIMP charge has far greater penetration ability of hard targets 
    at long distances than does the platter charge.  The SCIMP charge 
    described here can penetrate 1" thick steel at 50 years.

Note: The SCIMP charge relies on a super-heated, rod-like projectile traveling
at ultra high velocity to destroy its target.

Typist Note: I, the Mad Cracker, am not going to type every damn picture in the
book.  If you would like to build a "pipe pistol" I suggest you buy the books.
Unless you totally understand the instructions, I would not consider to attempt
these without pictures, as they are dangerous enough when done with the
pictures.

Two (2) wood screws #8

wood 8" x5" x 1"                                

drill

1/4" wood or metal rod, approx. 8" long


Procedure
---------

1.  Carefully inspect pipe and fittings.

    A.  Make sure that there are NO cracks or other flaws in the pipe or
        fittings.

    B.  Check inside diameter of pipe using a 9mm cartridge as a gauge.  The
        bullet should closely fit into the pipe without forcing but the 
        cartridge case SHOULD NOT fit into pipe.

    C.  Outside diameter of pipe MUST NOT be less that 1 1/2 times bullet
        diameter (.536 in; 1.37 cm)

2.  Drill a 9/16" diameter hole 3/8" into one coupling to remove the thread.

Note: Drilled section should fit tightly over smooth section of the pipe.

3.  Drill a 25/64" diameter hole 3/4" into pipe.  Use cartridge as a gauge;
    when cartridge is inserted into the pipe, the base of the case should 
    be even with the end of the pipe.  Thread coupling tightly onto pipe, 
    drilled end first.

4.  Drill a hole in the center of the pipe plug just large enough for the
    nail to fit through.

Note: THE HOLE MUST BE CENTERED IN PLUG.

5.  Push nail through plug until head of nail is flush with square end.  Cut
    nail off at other end 1/16" away from plug.  Round off end of nail wih
    file.

6.  Bend metal strap to "U" shape and drill holes for wood screws.  File two
    small notches at top.     
        
7.  Saw or otherwise shape 1" thick hardwood into stock.

8.  Drll a 9/16" diameter hole through the stock.  The center of the hole
    should be approx. 1/2" from the top.

9.  Slide the pipe through this hole and attach front coupling.

Note: If 9/16" drill is not available, cut a "V" groove in the top of the stock
and tape pipe securely in place.

10. Position metal strap on stock so that top will hit the head of the nail.  
    Attach to stock with wood screws on each side.

11. String elastic bands from front coupling to notch on each side of the 
    strap.

SAFETY CHECK- TEST FIRE PISTOL BEFORE HAND FIRING

1.  Locate a barrier such as a stone wall or large tree which you can stand 
    behid in case the pistol ruptures when fired.

2.  Mount pistol solidly to a table or other rigid support at least ten feet
    in front of the barrier.

3.  Attach a cord to the firing strap on the pistol.

4.  Holing the other end of the cord, go behind the barrier.

5.  Pull cord so that the firing strap is held back.

Cherry Bomb Flechette gun                                   Sec. III, No. 14

Typist note: In the Black book III, the .22 pistol is done again.  Since the 
two are almost identical and therefore, the second one has not be typed and
presented here.  That is the reason for this section being No. 14, instead of
No. 13.

A highly effective, hand held shotgun can be made from 3/4 in. water pipe and
the projectiles are homemade flechettes (steel darts) made from box nails.  
This shotgun uses cherry bombs as a source of propellant and can achieve muzzle
velocities as high as 1300 feet per second.  The effective range is appox. 50
yards.

Materials
---------

3/4 in. diameter water pipe, 12 inches long

3/4 in. pipe coupler and pipe plug

box nails between 1 in. and 1 1/2 in. long

short piece of 3/4 in. water pipe, approx 2 in. long

rubber from inner tube

cork from wine bottle

plaster of paris

hammer and drill with 1/8 in. bit

cherry bombs or homemade flash powder


Procedure
---------

1.  Flechette rounds can be made in the following manner:
    
    A.  Flatten the heads of box nails with a hammer.

    B.  Pour plaster of paris into a mold made from a short section of 3/4 in.
        water pipe, to a depth of 3/8 in.

    C.  Insert the nails, fins down, into this mold and allow the plaster of
        paris to harden. (approx. 20 minutes)

    D.  Push the flechette round out of the mold and set aside for later use.

2.  For every flechette round that is prepared, a gas seal spacer has to also
    be prepared in the following manner:

    A.  Using the short section of 3/4 in. water pipe as a die, sharpen the 
        edges with a file and hammer out circular pieces from a rubber inner
        tube.

    B.  Using a razor blade, cut a 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cord into 
        1/2 in. sections.

    C.  Attach the rubber gas seal to the cork spacer with a thumb tack.

3.  The shotgun may be prepared in the following manner:

    A.  Drill a 1/8 in. diameter hole through the center of a 3/4 in. pipe
        plug, then screw the pipe plug into a 3/4 in. pipe coupler.

    B.  Screw this pipe coupler assy. onto one end of a 12 inch long piece
        of 3/4 in. water pipe.


How To Use
----------

1.  Unscrew the pipe coupler assy. from the end of the pipe.

2.  Insert the flechette round into the pipe.

3.  Insert the gas seal spacer assy. behind the flechette round.

4.  Insert a cherry bomb into the pipe coupler assy. with the fuse protruding
    from the rear of the pipe plug.

5.  Screw the coupling assy. onto the pipe and ignite the fuse.

Note: Gloves should be worn if this weapon is to be hand fired.  With 
sufficient practice, it can be fired, broken down, reloaded and fired again in 
a reasonably short period of time.

A second application is to fire it electrically.

By using an electric bulb initiator (Sec. IV, No. 1) and filling the bulb with
the contents of a cherry bomb, this weapon can be used as an effective booby
trap to cover a trail or other type of passageway.  It can still be hand fired
by means of a hand held battery pack and switch arrangment.

If cherry bombs are not available, the following flash powders can be
substituted:

1.  4 parts by weight of potassium perchlorate
    1 part by weight of antimony sulfide
    1 part by weight aluminum powder

2.  3 parts by weight of potassium permanganate
    2 parts by weight of aluminum powder

3.  4 parts by weight of potassium chlorate
    1 part by weight of sulfur
    1 part by weight of aluminum powder

The fist mixture is standard cherry bomb powder and should be used whenever
possible.

The second mixture is an excellent substitute for the first and is relatively
safe to handle.

The third mixture is extremely shock sensitive and should only be used as a 
last resort.

To use these mixtures, separately pulverize each ingredient into a fine powder.
 Add these powder ingredients to a canning jar or other similar container with 
a tight fitting lid.  Mix thoroughly by gently tumbling the container between
the hands of a period of five minutes.  Add one gram (approx. 1 teaspoon) to an

        =|+|  |+|-------------------------
         |+|::|+|-------------------------
             

where:
        "=" is screw head
        ":" (space between) is rebber disk
        "|+|" is a washer
        "|-|" is a wooden stick

Note: Gun barrel is slightly less than 3/4 in. in diameter.  If rubber disk 
does not fit in barrel, file or trim it very slightly.  It should fit tightly.

3.  Drill a hole through the center of one wooden block of such size that the
    push rod will fit tightly.  Whittle a depression around the hole on one 
    side approx. 1/8 in. and large enough for the grenade to rest in.

4.  Place the base of the grenade in the wooden block.  Securely fasten grenade
    to block by wrapping tape (or wire) around entire grenade and block.

Note: Be sure that the tape or wire does not cover hole in block or interfere
with the operation of the grenade or safety lever.

5.  Drill hole through the center of the second wooden block, so that it
    will just slide over the outside of the gun barrel.

6.  Drill a hole in the center of the bottom of the tin can the same size as 
    the hole in the block.

This diamgram (hmpf!) represents the can, a wood block at the bottom, and nails
holding the block on (they are to be bent over).

8.  Slide the can and block onto the barrel until muzzle passes the can's open
    end.  Wrap a small piece of tape around the barrel an inch or two from the
    end.  Tightly wrapped string may be used instead of tape.  Force the can
    and wooden block forward against the tape so that they are securely held in
    place.  Wrap tape around the barrel behind the can.

Caution: Be sure that the can is securely fastened to the gun barrel.  If the
can should become looses and slip down the barrel after the launcher is
assembled, the grenade will explode aftr the egular delay time.

9.  Remove crimp from a 12 gauge shotgun shell with pen knife.  Open cartridge.
    Pour shot from shell.  Remove wads and plastic liner, if present.

10. Empty the propellant onto a piece of paper.  Using a knife, divide the
    propellant in half.  Replace half of the propellant into the cartridge
    case.

11. Replace the 12 gauge cardboard wads into cartridge case.

Note: If wads are not available, stuff tissue paper or cotton into the 
cartridge case.  Pack tighly.


How to Use
----------

Silent grenade launcher                                     Sec. IV, No. 7
                                                            
A completely silent grenade launcher can be made from a 12 gauge shotgun shell,
pieces of pipe, pipe resucer, wooden dowels and a wine bottle cork.  This
produces a launcher that can propel a fire bottle in excess of 100 yards and a
grenade in excess of 300 yards.  After firing, all of the expanding gas in
contained within the barrel.  This principle of gas containment produces a
completely silent weapon.

    wooden dowel will be mounted

    nuts and bolts, or nails, at least 2 1/2 in. long


Procedure
---------

1.  Carefully inspect pipe and fittings:

    A.  Make sure there are no cracks or other flaws.

    B.  Check inside diameter of pipe.  A 12 gauge shotgun shell should fit
        into the pipe but the brass rim of the shell should not.

    C.  Outside diameter of the pipe must be at least 1 in.

    D.  Screw the 3/4 in. - 1/2 in. pipe resucer onto the front end of the 
        pipe.  Sighting through the rear end of the pipe, ensure that the 
        reduced 1/2 in. center hole is centered with respect to the side 
        walls of the 3/4 in. pipe.  Remove the pipe reducer and set aside
        for later use.

CAUTION: Do not use a pipe reducer that causes an offset center hole when it is
tightened down on the end of the pipe.

2.  Cut stock from wood using a saw:

    | <-                approx. 32 in.                   -> |
    | <-    13 1/2 in.    -> |

n|_ |_____________________________-----------
        

3.  Cut 3/8 in. deep "V" groove int he top of the stock.

4.  Turn the 3/4 in. pipe coupling onto the rear of the pipe.

5.  Coat pipe and "V" groove of stock with shellac or lacquer and while still
    wet, place pipe in "V" groove and wrap pipe and stock together using two
    heavy layers of twine.  Coat twine with shellac or lacquer after each 
    layer.

6.  Using a metal file, file the threaded end of the pipe plug flat.  This
    allows a firm seat between the rear of the shotshell case and the end of
    the pipe plug.  However, because of tapered screw threads on the pipe and
    pipe plug, the pipe coupler my prevent firm seating between the shotshell 
    case and the pipe plug.  If this is the case, fill the space between the
    pipe plug and the shotshell case with 1 in. steel washers with holes in
    the center of the firing pin to pass through.

7.  Drill a hole through the center of the pipe plug large enough for a 8D
    nail to pass through.

8.  Using the same size drill, drill a hole through  the rear side of the
    pipe plug, perpendicular to and intersecting witht he central firing pin
    hole.  This is going to be used as a safety for the firing pin.

9.  Push an 8D nail through the central firing pin hole and cut off flat
    1/32 in. past the end of the pipe plug or the end of the last 1 in. steel
    washer.

10. Using a file, notch the firing pin nail where the side hole intersects
    with the central firing pin hole and file the end round.

11. Using a serparate 8D nail, push it through the side hole.  Note where
    it intersents the firing pin hole and file it flat, to half its normal
    thickness, from that point until it passes through the other side.

12. Insert the firing pin into the central firing pin hole, aligning the slot
    in the firing pin with he safety hole in the side of the pipe plug.

13. Insert the safety nail through the side hole so that it interlocks with
    the central firing pin.  Bend the protruding end of the safety nail 
    around the end pipe plug to ensure that the firing pin is locked into
    place.

14. Insert steel washers, if necessary, and screw end plug tightly into pipe
    coupler.

15. Bend a 4 in. metal strap into an "L" shape and drill a hole for the side
    pivot screw to pass through.  Notch the metal strap on the long side, 1/2
    in. from the bend.

16. Position the metal strap on the stock sp that the top will hit the head of
    the nail.  Attach to the stock using a wood pivot screw.

17. Place a screw on each side of the stock about 4 in. in front of the metal 
    strap.  Pass rubber bands through the notch in the metal strap and attach
    to screw on each side of the stock.

18. Two gas containment pistons should be made in the following manner:

    A.  Cut a 3/4 in. diameter wood dowel to a length of 1 1/2 in.  Round the
        forward edges of the dowel off with file.

    B.  Attach a 3/4 in. diameter, 1/4 in. thick rubber or leather washer
        to the rearend of the wooden dowel with a thumb tack.  If rubber
        or leather of the proper thickness is not available, the washer
        can be built up to 1/4 in. thick with successive layers of thin
        rubber or leather.

    C.  Cut a 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cork to a length of 1 1/2 in.
    
    D.  Set both pistons aside for later use.

19. A launching platform should be made in the following manner:

    A.  Drill a 1/2 in. hole approx. 1 in. deep in the center of the wood
        block.  The 1/2 in. diameter, 30 in. long hard wooden dowel is to
        fir into this hole.

    B.  Drill two 1/4 in. holes on opposite sides of the wooden support
        block.  These holes should be drilled clear through the block for
        bolts to pass through.

    C.  Using the supporting block as a template, mark the bolt holes on the 
        bottom of a tin can which is large enought to hold either a fire
        bottle or hand grenade, then drill the two holes in the bottom of the
        can.  Secure the can to the supporting block by placing 1/4 in. bolts
        through the bottom of the can and the block, securing with nuts.

    D.  Push the 30 in. long, 1/2 in. diameter wooden dowel into the 1 in.
        deep hole in the bottom of the supporting block.  Secure in place
        by driving a nail through the supporting block and into the center
        of the wooden dowel.

20. Prepare a 12 gauge shotgun shell in the following manner:

    A.  Remove crimp from the shell with a pen knife.  Pour shot from shell
        and remove the wads and plastic liner if present.

    B.  Empty the propellant onto a folded piece of paper.  Divide the 
        propellant into thirds.  Replace 2/3 of the propellant back into
        the shell case.

    C.  Replace the 12 gauge cardboard wads back into the shell casing.  If
        wads are not available, stuff tissue paper or cotton into the shell 
        case and pack tightly.


How to Use
----------

1.  To load:

    A.  Remoove the firing pin plug from the rear of the pipe coupler.

    B.  Insert the specially loaded 12 gauge shotgun into the rear end of
        the pipe.

    C.  Insert steel washers if necessary and screw the pipe plug back into
        the rear pipe coupler until it seats against the base of the shell.

    D.  Cover the 3/4 in. wooden dowel (gas containment piston) with Vaseline
        and insert in the forward end of the barrel.  Using the launching 
        platform as a ramrod, push the piston down against the shotgun shell
        in the rear of the launcher.

    E.  Cover the 3/4 in. diameter wine bottle cork with Vaseline and press
        down against the wooden piston.

    F.  Secure the 3/4 in. to 1/2 in. pipe reducer tightly to the forward 
        end of the pipe barrel.

    G.  Insert the 1/2 in. x 30 in. wooden dowel launching platform into
        the barrel through the center hole of the pipe reducer and seat
        it against the cork secondary gas seal.

    H.  Isert fire bottle, hand grenade, or pipe bombs into the tin can on 
        the end of the launching platform.

Note: If a fire bottle is used, crumple paper and place in the bottom of the
can.  wrap more paper around the fire bottle and insert into the can.  Use
enough paper so the bottle will fit snugly.

2.  To fire:

    A.  Place stock of launcher against the ground and position the launcher
        at various degrees of elevation, in relation to ground level, so that
        variations of ranges can be achieved.

    B.  Pull firing strap back with thumb.  When ready to fire, release strap.

glass bottle with stopper (1 qt. approx.)

small bottle or jar with lid

rag or absorbent paper (paper towels, newpaper)

string or rubber bands


Procedure
---------

1.  Sulfuric acid must be concentrated.  If battery acid or other dilute
    acid is used, concentrate it by boiling until dense white fumes are
    given off.  Container should be oven glass or enamel-ware.

CAUTION: Sulfuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is spilled,
wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also dangerous and
should not be inhaled.

2.  Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.

3.  Pour gasoline into the large (1 qt.) bottle until it is approx. 2/3 full.

4.  Add concentrated sulfuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle
    is filled to within 1 to 2 in. from the top.  Place the stopper in the
    mouth of the bottle.

5.  Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

CAUTION: If this is NOT done, the bottle may be dangerous to handle during use.

6.  Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside 
    of the bottle.  Tie with string ot fasten with rubber bands.

7.  Dissolve 1/2 cup of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup of sugar in one cup of
    boiling water.

8.  Allow the solution to cool, pout into the small bottle and cap slightly.

CAUTION: Store this bottle separately from the other bottle.


How to Use
----------

1.  Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper
    around the large bottle.

Bottle can be used wet or after solution has dried.  However, when dry, the
sugar-Potassium nitrate mixture is very sensitive to spark or flame and should
be handled accordingly.  

2.  Throw ot launch the bottle.  When the bottle breaks against a hard 
    surface (target) the acid in the gasoline will react with the chlorate-
    sugar mixture annd then ignite the gasoline.




Igniter from book matches                                   Sec. V, No. 2

This is a hot igniter made from paper book matches for use with molotov
cocktails and other incendiaries.

Materials
---------

paper book matches

adhesive or friction tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Remove the staple(s) from match book and separate matches from cover.

2.  Fold and tape one row of matches.

3.  Shape the cover into a tube with striking surface on the inside and tape.
    Make sure the folded cover will fit tightly around the taped match heads.
    Leave cover open at opposite end for insertion of the matches.

4.  Push the taped matches into the tube until the bottom ends are exposed 
    about 3.4 in.

5.  Flatten and fold the open end of the tube so that it laps over about 1 in,;
    tape in place.


Use with Molotov Cocktail
-------------------------

Tap the "match end tab" of the igniter to the neck of the molotov cocktail.

Grasp the "cover end tab" and pull sharply or quickly to ignite.


General Use
-----------

The book match igniter can be used by itself to ignite flammable liquids, fuse
cords, and other similar items requiring hot ignition.

CAUTION: Store matches and completed igniters in moistureproof containers such
as rubber or plastic bags until ready for use.  Damp or wet paper book matches
will not ignite.




Mechanically Initiated fire bottle                          Sec. V, No. 3

The mechanically initiated fire bottle is an incendiary device which ignites when thrown against a hd surface.

Materials
---------

glass jar or short neck bottle with a leakproof lid or stopper

tin can or similar container just large enough to fit over the lid of the jar

coil spring (compression) approx. 1/2 the diameter of the can and 1 1/2 times 
as long

gasoline

four (4) "blue tip" matches (I think they are called Ohio kitchen matches)

flat stick or piece of metal roughly 1/2 in. x 1/16 in. x 4 in.

wire or heavy twine

adhesive tape


Procedure
---------

1.  Draw or scratch two lines around the can- one 3/4 in. and the other 1 1/4
    in. from the open end.

2.  Cut 2 slots on opposite sides of the tin can at the line farthest from
    the open end.  Make slots large enough for the flat stick or piece
    of metal to pass through.

3.  Punch 2 small holes just below the rim of the open end of the can.

4.  Tape blue tip matches together in pairs.  The distance between the match
    heads should equal the inside diameter of the can.  Two pairs are
    sufficient.  

5.  Attach paired matches to second and third coils of the spring, using thin
    wire.

6.  Insert the end of the spring opposite the matches into the tin can.

7.  Compress the spring until the end with the matches passes the slot in the
    can.  Pass the flat stick or piece of metal through slots in can to hold
    spring in place.  This acts as a safety device.

8.  Puch many closely packed small holes between the lines marked on the can
    to form a striking surface for the matches.  Be careful to not seriously
    deform the can.

9.  Fill the jar with gasoline and cap tightly.

10. Turn can over and place over the jar so that the safety stick rests on
    the lid of the jar.

11. Pass wire or twine around the bottom of the jar.  Thread ends through
    the holes in can and bind tightly to jar.

12. Tape wire or cord to jar near the bottom.


How to Use
----------

1.  Carefully withdraw flat safety stick.

2.  Throw jar at hard surface.

CAUTION: DO NOT REMOVE SAFETY STICK UNTIL READY TO THROW FIRE BOTTLE.  The
safety stick, when in place, prevents ignition of the fire bottle if it should
accidently be broken.




Gelled flame Fuels                                          Sec. V, No. 4

Gelled or paste type fuels are often preferable to raw gasoline for use in
incediary devices such as fire bottles.  This type fuel adheres more readily to
the target and produces greater heat concentration.

Several methods are shown for gelling gasoline using commonly avilable
materials.  The methods are divided into the following catagories based on the
major ingredient:

        4.1  Lye systems
        4.2  Lye-alcohol
        4.3  Soap-alcohol systems
        4.4  Egg white systems
        4.5  Latex systems
        4.6  Wax systems
        4.7  Animal blood systems


I will type this one warning ONE TIME only! 

CAUTION: Never at ANY time should you light up a cigarette while mixing flame
fuels!  No Smoking!  Go smokeless!


Lye Systems                                                 Sec. V, No. 4.1       
Lye (also known as caustic soda or Sodium hydroxide) can be used in combination
with powdered rosin ot castor oil to gel gasoline for use as a flame fuel which
will adhere to target surfaces.

Note: This fuel is not suitable for use in the chemical (sulfuric acid) type of
fire bottle (Sec. V, No. 1).  The acid will react with the lye and break down
the gel.

    E.  Any vegetable oil (corn, cottonseed, peanut, linseed, etc.)

It is necessary when using substitutes E and D to double the given amount of 
fat and lye for satisfactory bodying.


Procedure
---------

1.  Pour gasoline into bottle, jar or other container.  (Do not use an aluminum
    container)

2.  Add tallow or substitute to the gasoline and stir for about 1/2 min. to
    dissolve fat.

3.  Add alcohol to the gasoline mixture.

4.  In a separate container (Not aluminum) slowly add lye to an  equal amount
    of water.  Mixture should be stirred constantly while adding lye.

5.  Add lye solution to the gasoline mixture and stir occasionally until
    thickened (about 1/2 hour).

Note: The mixture will eventually (1 to 2 days) thicken to a very firm paste.  
This can be thinned, if desired, by stirring in additional gasoline.

Procedure
---------

1.  Separate the egg white from yolk.  This can be done by breaking the egg 
    into a disk and carefully removing the yolk with a spoon.

Note: Do not get the yellow egg yolk mixed into the egg white.  If egg yolk 
gets into the egg white, discard the egg.

2.  Pour egg white into a jar, bottle, or other container and add gasoline.

3.  Add the salt or other additive to the mixture and stir occasionally until
    a gel forms (about 5-10 minutes).

Note: A thicker gelled flame fuel can be obtained by putting the capped jar in
hot (65 degree C) water for about 1/2 hour and then letting them cool to room
temperature.  (Do not heat the gelled fuel containing coffee).

Procedure
--------- 

1.  Obtaining wax from Natural sources:  Plants and berries are potential
    sources of natural waxes.  Place the plants and/or berries in boiling 
    water.  The natural waxes will melt.  Let the water cool.  The natural
    waxes will form a solid layer on the water surface.  Skim off the solid
    wax and let dry.  With natural waxes which has suspended matter when 
    melted, screen the wax through a cloth.

2.  Melt the wax and pour into jar or bottle which has been placed in a hot 
    water bath.

3.  Add gasoline to the bottle.

4.  When wax has completely dissolved in the gasoline, allow the water bath to
    cool slowly to room temp. 

Note: If a gel does not form, add additional wax, (up to 40 % by volume) and
repeat the above steps.  if no gel forms with 40 % wax,, make a lye solution by
dissolving a small amount of lye (sodium hydroxide) in a equal amount of water.
Add this solution (1/2% by volume) to the gasoline wax mix and shake bottle
until get forms.

   I.  The History of the Atomic Bomb
       ------------------------------

       On August 2nd 1939, just before the beginning of World War II, Albert
Einstein wrote to then President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Einstein and several
other scientists told Roosevelt of efforts in Nazi Germany to purify U-235
with which might in turn be used to build an atomic bomb.  It was shortly
thereafter that the United States Government began the serious undertaking
known only then as the Manhattan Project.  Simply put, the Manhattan Project
was committed to expedient research and production that would produce a viable
atomic bomb.

     The most complicated issue to be addressed was the production of ample
amounts of `enriched' uranium to sustain a chain reaction.  At the time,
Uranium-235 was very hard to extract.  In fact, the ratio of conversion from
Uranium ore to Uranium metal is 500:1.  An additional drawback is that the 1
part of Uranium that is finally refined from the ore consists of over 99%
Uranium-238, which is practically useless for an atomic bomb.  To make it even
more difficult, U-235 and U-238 are precisely similar in their chemical
makeup.  This proved to be as much of a challenge as separating a solution of
sucrose from a solution of glucose.  No ordinary chemical extraction could
separate the two isotopes.  Only mechanical methods could effectively separate
U-235 from U-238.  Several scientists at Columbia University managed to solve
this dilemma.

     A massive enrichment laboratory/plant was constructed at Oak Ridge,
Tennessee.  H.C. Urey, along with his associates and colleagues at Columbia
University, devised a system that worked on the principle of gaseous
diffusion.  Following this process, Ernest O.  Lawrence (inventor of the
Cyclotron) at the University of California in Berkeley implemented a process
involving magnetic separation of the two isotopes.

     Following the first two processes, a gas centrifuge was used to further
separate the lighter U-235 from the heavier non-fissionable U-238 by their
mass.  Once all of these procedures had been completed, all that needed to be
done was to put to the test the entire concept behind atomic fission.  [For
more information on these procedures of refining Uranium, see Section 3.]

     Over the course of six years, ranging from 1939 to 1945, more than 2
billion dollars were spent on the Manhattan Project.  The formulas for
refining Uranium and putting together a working bomb were created and seen to
their logical ends by some of the greatest minds of our time.  Among these
people who unleashed the power of the atomic bomb was J. Robert Oppenheimer.

     Oppenheimer was the major force behind the Manhattan Project.  He
literally ran the show and saw to it that all of the great minds working on
this project made their brainstorms work.  He oversaw the entire project from
its conception to its completion.

     Finally the day came when all at Los Alamos would find out whether or not
The Gadget (code-named as such during its development) was either going to be
the colossal dud of the century or perhaps end the war.  It all came down to
a fateful morning of midsummer, 1945.

     At 5:29:45 (Mountain War Time) on July 16th, 1945, in a white blaze that
stretched from the basin of the Jemez Mountains in northern New Mexico to the
still-dark skies, The Gadget ushered in the Atomic Age.  The light of the
explosion then turned orange as the atomic fireball began shooting upwards at
360 feet per second, reddening and pulsing as it cooled. The characteristic
mushroom cloud of radioactive vapor materialized at 30,000 feet.  Beneath the
cloud, all that remained of the soil at the blast site were fragments of jade
green radioactive glass.  ...All of this caused by the heat of the reaction.

     The brilliant light from the detonation pierced the early morning skies
with such intensity that residents from a faraway neighboring community would
swear that the sun came up twice that day.  Even more astonishing is that a
blind girl saw the flash 120 miles away.

     Upon witnessing the explosion, reactions among the people who created
it were mixed.  Isidor Rabi felt that the equilibrium in nature had been
upset -- as if humankind had become a threat to the world it inhabited.
J. Robert Oppenheimer, though ecstatic about the success of the project,
quoted a remembered fragment from Bhagavad Gita.  "I am become Death," he
said, "the destroyer of worlds."  Ken Bainbridge, the test director, told
Oppenheimer, "Now we're all sons of bitches."

     Several participants, shortly after viewing the results, signed petitions
against loosing the monster they had created, but their protests fell on deaf
ears.  As it later turned out, the Jornada del Muerto of New Mexico was not
the last site on planet Earth to experience an atomic explosion.

     As many know, atomic bombs have been used only twice in warfare.  The
first and foremost blast site of the atomic bomb is Hiroshima.  A Uranium
bomb (which weighed in at over 4 & 1/2 tons) nicknamed "Little Boy" was
dropped on Hiroshima August 6th, 1945.  The Aioi Bridge, one of 81 bridges
connecting the seven-branched delta of the Ota River, was the aiming point of
the bomb.  Ground Zero was set at 1,980 feet.  At 0815 hours, the bomb was
dropped from the Enola Gay.  It missed by only 800 feet.  At 0816 hours, in
the flash of an instant, 66,000 people were killed and 69,000 people were
injured by a 10 kiloton atomic explosion.

     The point of total vaporization from the blast measured one half of a
mile in diameter.  Total destruction ranged at one mile in diameter.  Severe
blast damage carried as far as two miles in diameter.  At two and a half
miles, everything flammable in the area burned.  The remaining area of the
blast zone was riddled with serious blazes that stretched out to the final
edge at a little over three miles in diameter.  [See diagram below for blast
ranges from the atomic blast.]

     On August 9th 1945, Nagasaki fell to the same treatment as Hiroshima.
Only this time, a Plutonium bomb nicknamed "Fat Man" was dropped on the city.
Even though the "Fat Man" missed by over a mile and a half, it still leveled
nearly half the city.  Nagasaki's population dropped in one split-second from
422,000 to 383,000.  39,000 were killed, over 25,000 were injured.  That
blast was less than 10 kilotons as well.  Estimates from physicists who have
studied each atomic explosion state that the bombs that were used had utilized
only 1/10th of 1 percent of their respective explosive capabilities.

     While the mere explosion from an atomic bomb is deadly enough, its
destructive ability doesn't stop there.  Atomic fallout creates another hazard
as well.  The rain that follows any atomic detonation is laden with
radioactive particles.  Many survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki blasts
succumbed to radiation poisoning due to this occurance.

     The atomic detonation also has the hidden lethal surprise of affecting
the future generations of those who live through it.  Leukemia is among the
greatest of afflictions that are passed on to the offspring of survivors.

     While the main purpose behind the atomic bomb is obvious, there are many
by-products that have been brought into consideration in the use of all
weapons atomic.  With one small atomic bomb, a massive area's communications,
travel and machinery will grind to a dead halt due to the EMP (Electro-
Magnetic Pulse) that is radiated from a high-altitude atomic detonation.
These high-level detonations are hardly lethal, yet they deliver a serious
enough EMP to scramble any and all things electronic ranging from copper wires
all the way up to a computer's CPU within a 50 mile radius.

     At one time, during the early days of The Atomic Age, it was a popular
notion that one day atomic bombs would one day be used in mining operations
and perhaps aid in the construction of another Panama Canal.  Needless to say,
it never came about.  Instead, the military applications of atomic destruction
increased.  Atomic tests off of the Bikini Atoll and several other sites were
common up until the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was introduced.  Photos of nuclear
test sites here in the United States can be obtained through the Freedom of
Information Act.

     II.  Nuclear Fission/Nuclear Fusion
          ------------------------------

     There are 2 types of atomic explosions that can be facilitated by U-235;
fission and fusion.  Fission, simply put, is a nuclear reaction in which an
atomic nucleus splits into fragments, usually two fragments of comparable
mass, with the evolution of approximately 100 million to several hundred
million volts of energy.  This energy is expelled explosively and violently in
the atomic bomb.  A fusion reaction is invariably started with a fission
reaction, but unlike the fission reaction, the fusion (Hydrogen) bomb derives
its power from the fusing of nuclei of various hydrogen isotopes in the
formation of helium nuclei.  Being that the bomb in this file is strictly
atomic, the other aspects of the Hydrogen Bomb will be set aside for now.

     The massive power behind the reaction in an atomic bomb arises from the
forces that hold the atom together.  These forces are akin to, but not quite
the same as, magnetism.

     Atoms are comprised of three sub-atomic particles.  Protons and neutrons
cluster together to form the nucleus (central mass) of the atom while the
electrons orbit the nucleus much like planets around a sun.  It is these
particles that determine the stability of the atom.

     Most natural elements have very stable atoms which are impossible to
split except by bombardment by particle accelerators.  For all practical
purposes, the one true element whose atoms can be split comparatively easily
is the metal Uranium.  Uranium's atoms are unusually large, henceforth, it is
hard for them to hold together firmly.  This makes Uranium-235 an exceptional
candidate for nuclear fission.

     Uranium is a heavy metal, heavier than gold, and not only does it have
the largest atoms of any natural element, the atoms that comprise Uranium have
far more neutrons than protons.  This does not enhance their capacity to
split, but it does have an important bearing on their capacity to facilitate
an explosion.

     There are two isotopes of Uranium.  Natural Uranium consists mostly of
isotope U-238, which has 92 protons and 146 neutrons (92+146=238).  Mixed with
this isotope, one will find a 0.6% accumulation of U-235, which has only 143
neutrons.  This isotope, unlike U-238, has atoms that can be split, thus it is
termed "fissionable" and useful in making atomic bombs.  Being that U-238 is
neutron-heavy, it reflects neutrons, rather than absorbing them like its
brother isotope, U-235.  (U-238 serves no function in an atomic reaction, but
its properties provide an excellent shield for the U-235 in a constructed bomb
as a neutron reflector.  This helps prevent an accidental chain reaction
between the larger U-235 mass and its `bullet' counterpart within the bomb.
Also note that while U-238 cannot facilitate a chain-reaction, it can be
neutron-saturated to produce Plutonium (Pu-239).  Plutonium is fissionable and
can be used in place of Uranium-235 {albeit, with a different model of
detonator} in an atomic bomb. [See Sections 3 & 4 of this file.])

     Both isotopes of Uranium are naturally radioactive.  Their bulky atoms
disintegrate over a period of time.  Given enough time, (over 100,000 years or
more) Uranium will eventually lose so many particles that it will turn into
the metal lead.  However, this process can be accelerated.  This process is
known as the chain reaction.  Instead of disintegrating slowly, the atoms are
forcibly split by neutrons forcing their way into the nucleus.  A U-235 atom
is so unstable that a blow from a single neutron is enough to split it and
henceforth bring on a chain reaction.  This can happen even when a critical
mass is present.  When this chain reaction occurs, the Uranium atom splits
into two smaller atoms of different elements, such as Barium and Krypton.

     When a U-235 atom splits, it gives off energy in the form of heat and
Gamma radiation, which is the most powerful form of radioactivity and the most
lethal.  When this reaction occurs, the split atom will also give off two or
three of its `spare' neutrons, which are not needed to make either Barium or
Krypton.  These spare neutrons fly out with sufficient force to split other
atoms they come in contact with.  [See chart below]  In theory, it is
necessary to split only one U-235 atom, and the neutrons from this will split
other atoms, which will split more...so on and so forth.  This progression
does not take place arithmetically, but geometrically.  All of this will
happen within a millionth of a second.

     The minimum amount to start a chain reaction as described above is known
as SuperCritical Mass.  The actual mass needed to facilitate this chain
reaction depends upon the purity of the material, but for pure U-235, it is
110 pounds (50 kilograms), but no Uranium is never quite pure, so in reality
more will be needed.

     Uranium is not the only material used for making atomic bombs.  Another
material is the element Plutonium, in its isotope Pu-239.  Plutonium is not
found naturally (except in minute traces) and is always made from Uranium.
The only way to produce Plutonium from Uranium is to process U-238 through a
nuclear reactor.  After a period of time, the intense radioactivity causes the
metal to pick up extra particles, so that more and more of its atoms turn into
Plutonium.

     Plutonium will not start a fast chain reaction by itself, but this
difficulty is overcome by having a neutron source, a highly radioactive
material that gives off neutrons faster than the Plutonium itself.  In certain
types of bombs, a mixture of the elements Beryllium and Polonium is used to
bring about this reaction.  Only a small piece is needed.  The material is not
fissionable in and of itself, but merely acts as a catalyst to the greater
reaction.

     III.  The Mechanism of The Bomb
           -------------------------

     Altimeter
     ---------

     An ordinary aircraft altimeter uses a type of Aneroid Barometer which
measures the changes in air pressure at different heights.  However, changes
in air pressure due to the weather can adversely affect the altimeter's
readings.  It is far more favorable to use a radar (or radio) altimeter for
enhanced accuracy when the bomb reaches Ground Zero.

     While Frequency Modulated-Continuous Wave (FM CW) is more complicated,
the accuracy of it far surpasses any other type of altimeter.  Like simple
pulse systems, signals are emitted from a radar aerial (the bomb), bounced off
the ground and received back at the bomb's altimeter.  This pulse system
applies to the more advanced altimeter system, only the signal is continuous
and centered around a high frequency such as 4200 MHz.  This signal is
arranged to steadily increase at 200 MHz per interval before dropping back to
its original frequency.

     As the descent of the bomb begins, the altimeter transmitter will send
out a pulse starting at 4200 MHz.  By the time that pulse has returned, the
altimeter transmitter will be emitting a higher frequency.  The difference
depends on how long the pulse has taken to do the return journey.  When these
two frequencies are mixed electronically, a new frequency (the difference
between the two) emerges.  The value of this new frequency is measured by the
built-in microchips.  This value is directly proportional to the distance
travelled by the original pulse, so it can be used to give the actual height.

     In practice, a typical FM CW radar today would sweep 120 times per
second.  Its range would be up to 10,000 feet (3000 m) over land and 20,000
feet (6000 m) over sea, since sound reflections from water surfaces are
clearer.

     The accuracy of these altimeters is within 5 feet (1.5 m) for the higher
ranges.  Being that the ideal airburst for the atomic bomb is usually set for
1,980 feet, this error factor is not of enormous concern.

     The high cost of these radar-type altimeters has prevented their use in
commercial applications, but the decreasing cost of electronic components
should make them competitive with barometric types before too long.

     Air Pressure Detonator
     ----------------------

     The air pressure detonator can be a very complex mechanism, but for all
practical purposes, a simpler model can be used.  At high altitudes, the air
is of lesser pressure.  As the altitude drops, the air pressure increases.  A
simple piece of very thin magnetized metal can be used as an air pressure
detonator.  All that is needed is for the strip of metal to have a bubble of
extremely thin metal forged in the center and have it placed directly
underneath the electrical contact which will trigger the conventional
explosive detonation.  Before setting the strip in place, push the bubble in
so that it will be inverted.

     Once the air pressure has achieved the desired level, the magnetic bubble
will snap back into its original position and strike the contact, thus
completing the circuit and setting off the explosive(s).

     Detonating Head
     ---------------

     The detonating head (or heads, depending on whether a Uranium or
Plutonium bomb is being used as a model) that is seated in the conventional
explosive charge(s) is similar to the standard-issue blasting cap.  It merely
serves as a catalyst to bring about a greater explosion.  Calibration of this
device is essential.  Too small of a detonating head will only cause a
colossal dud that will be doubly dangerous since someone's got to disarm and
re-fit the bomb with another detonating head. (an added measure of discomfort
comes from the knowledge that the conventional explosive may have detonated
with insufficient force to weld the radioactive metals.  This will cause a
supercritical mass that could go off at any time.)  The detonating head will
receive an electric charge from the either the air pressure detonator or the
radar altimeter's coordinating detonator, depending on what type of system is
used.  The Du Pont company makes rather excellent blasting caps that can be
easily modified to suit the required specifications.

     Conventional Explosive Charge(s)
     --------------------------------

     This explosive is used to introduce (and weld) the lesser amount of
Uranium to the greater amount within the bomb's housing.  [The amount of
pressure needed to bring this about is unknown and possibly classified by the
United States Government for reasons of National Security]

     Plastic explosives work best in this situation since they can be
manipulated to enable both a Uranium bomb and a Plutonium bomb to detonate.
One very good explosive is Urea Nitrate.  The directions on how to make Urea
Nitrate are as follows:

     - Ingredients -
     ---------------
     [1]  1 cup concentrated solution of uric acid (C5 H4 N4 O3)
     [2]  1/3 cup of nitric acid
     [3]  4 heat-resistant glass containers
     [4]  4 filters (coffee filters will do)

     Filter the concentrated solution of uric acid through a filter to remove
impurities.  Slowly add 1/3 cup of nitric acid to the solution and let the
mixture stand for 1 hour.  Filter again as before.  This time the Urea Nitrate
crystals will collect on the filter.  Wash the crystals by pouring water over
them while they are in the filter.  Remove the crystals from the filter and
allow 16 hours for them to dry.  This explosive will need a blasting cap to
detonate.

     It may be necessary to make a quantity larger than the aforementioned
list calls for to bring about an explosion great enough to cause the Uranium
(or Plutonium) sections to weld together on impact.

     Neutron Deflector
     -----------------

     The neutron deflector is comprised solely of Uranium-238.  Not only is
U-238 non-fissionable, it also has the unique ability to reflect neutrons back
to their source.

     The U-238 neutron deflector can serve 2 purposes.  In a Uranium bomb, the
neutron deflector serves as a safeguard to keep an accidental supercritical
mass from occurring by bouncing the stray neutrons from the `bullet'
counterpart of the Uranium mass away from the greater mass below it (and vice-
versa).  The neutron deflector in a Plutonium bomb actually helps the wedges
of Plutonium retain their neutrons by `reflecting' the stray particles back
into the center of the assembly.  [See diagram in Section 4 of this file.]

     Uranium & Plutonium
     -------------------

     Uranium-235 is very difficult to extract.  In fact, for every 25,000 tons
of Uranium ore that is mined from the earth, only 50 tons of Uranium metal can
be refined from that, and 99.3% of that metal is U-238 which is too stable to
be used as an active agent in an atomic detonation.  To make matters even more
complicated, no ordinary chemical extraction can separate the two isotopes
since both U-235 and U-238 possess precisely identical chemical
characteristics.  The only methods that can effectively separate U-235 from
U-238 are mechanical methods.

     U-235 is slightly, but only slightly, lighter than its counterpart,
U-238.  A system of gaseous diffusion is used to begin the separating process
between the two isotopes.  In this system, Uranium is combined with fluorine
to form Uranium Hexafluoride gas.  This mixture is then propelled by low-
pressure pumps through a series of extremely fine porous barriers.  Because
the U-235 atoms are lighter and thus propelled faster than the U-238 atoms,
they could penetrate the barriers more rapidly.  As a result, the
U-235's concentration became successively greater as it passed through each
barrier.  After passing through several thousand barriers, the Uranium
Hexafluoride contains a relatively high concentration of U-235 -- 2% pure
Uranium in the case of reactor fuel, and if pushed further could
(theoretically) yield up to 95% pure Uranium for use in an atomic bomb.

     Once the process of gaseous diffusion is finished, the Uranium must be
refined once again.  Magnetic separation of the extract from the previous
enriching process is then implemented to further refine the Uranium.  This
involves electrically charging Uranium Tetrachloride gas and directing it past
a weak electromagnet.  Since the lighter U-235 particles in the gas stream are
less affected by the magnetic pull, they can be gradually separated from the
flow.

     Following the first two procedures, a third enrichment process is then
applied to the extract from the second process.  In this procedure, a gas
centrifuge is brought into action to further separate the lighter U-235 from
its heavier counter-isotope.  Centrifugal force separates the two isotopes of
Uranium by their mass.  Once all of these procedures have been completed, all
that need be done is to place the properly molded components of Uranium-235
inside a warhead that will facilitate an atomic detonation.

     Supercritical mass for Uranium-235 is defined as 110 lbs (50 kgs) of
pure Uranium.

     Depending on the refining process(es) used when purifying the U-235 for
use, along with the design of the warhead mechanism and the altitude at which
it detonates, the explosive force of the A-bomb can range anywhere from 1
kiloton (which equals 1,000 tons of TNT) to 20 megatons (which equals 20
million tons of TNT -- which, by the way, is the smallest strategic nuclear
warhead we possess today.  {Point in fact -- One Trident Nuclear Submarine
carries as much destructive power as 25 World War II's}).

     While Uranium is an ideally fissionable material, it is not the only one.
Plutonium can be used in an atomic bomb as well.  By leaving U-238 inside an
atomic reactor for an extended period of time, the U-238 picks up extra
particles (neutrons especially) and gradually is transformed into the element
Plutonium.

     Plutonium is fissionable, but not as easily fissionable as Uranium.
While Uranium can be detonated by a simple 2-part gun-type device, Plutonium
must be detonated by a more complex 32-part implosion chamber along with a
stronger conventional explosive, a greater striking velocity and a
simultaneous triggering mechanism for the conventional explosive packs.  Along
with all of these requirements comes the additional task of introducing a fine
mixture of Beryllium and Polonium to this metal while all of these actions are
occurring.

     Supercritical mass for Plutonium is defined as 35.2 lbs (16 kgs).  This
amount needed for a supercritical mass can be reduced to a smaller quantity of
22 lbs (10 kgs) by surrounding the Plutonium with a U-238 casing.

     To illustrate the vast difference between a Uranium gun-type detonator
and a Plutonium implosion detonator, here is a quick rundown.

 ============================================================================

     [1]  Uranium Detonator
          -----------------

              Comprised of 2 parts.  Larger mass is spherical and concave.
              Smaller mass is precisely the size and shape of the `missing'
              section of the larger mass.  Upon detonation of conventional
              explosive, the smaller mass is violently injected and welded
              to the larger mass.  Supercritical mass is reached, chain
              reaction follows in one millionth of a second.

     [2]  Plutonium Detonator
          -------------------

              Comprised of 32 individual 45-degree pie-shaped sections of
              Plutonium surrounding a Beryllium/Polonium mixture.  These 32
              sections together form a sphere.  All of these sections must
              have the precisely equal mass (and shape) of the others.  The
              shape of the detonator resembles a soccerball.  Upon detonation
              of conventional explosives, all 32 sections must merge with the
              B/P mixture within 1 ten-millionths of a second.

     Lead Shield
     -----------

     The lead shield's only purpose is to prevent the inherent radioactivity
of the bomb's payload from interfering with the other mechanisms of the bomb.
The neutron flux of the bomb's payload is strong enough to short circuit the
internal circuitry and cause an accidental or premature detonation.

     Fuses
     -----

     The fuses are implemented as another safeguard to prevent an accidental
detonation of both the conventional explosives and the nuclear payload.  These
fuses are set near the surface of the `nose' of the bomb so that they can be
installed easily when the bomb is ready to be launched.  The fuses should be
installed only shortly before the bomb is launched.  To affix them before it
is time could result in an accident of catastrophic proportions.

HEAVILY EDITED by: Kloey Detect of Five O and B.S. of Hardbodies

Special thanks to WordPerfect Corporation for their spelling
checker.......This file NEEDED IT!

(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)
SPECIAL THANX ALSO GOES OUT TO:

Nitro Glycerine: For providing the files!
Xpax           : For being patient while the cop was there!
The Producer   : For getting the files to me....
The Director   : For getting the files to me....
Mr.Camaro      : For his BIG EGO!!!
The Magician   : For ALL the Bernoulli carts he is gonna send!!


This is a collection of many years worth of effort........this is
the original manuscript for a non-published work, from an unknown
author.....It was originally two LARGE files which had to be
merged and then HEAVILY EDITED, mostly the pictures, and then
spellchecked...This guy is a chemical genius but he could not
spell if his life depended on it....I have simply run a spell
check via WordPerfect 4.2, so there are probably more errors
which were not picked up...sorry...I hope you have the patience
to sit through this file, read it, then correct every little
error....It is not like I am submitting it or anything...!!!!!


This file is dedicated To Kathie & KiKi

1.0     INTRODUCTION

     Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies, a division of Chaos Industries (CHAOS), is
proud to present this first edition of The Terrorist's Handbook.  First and
foremost, let it be stated that Chaos Industries assumes no responsibilities
for any misuse of the information presented in this publication.  The purpose
of this is to show the many techniques and methods used by those people in this
and other countries who employ terror as a means to political and social goals.
The techniques herein can be obtained from public libraries, and can usually be
carried out by a terrorist with minimal equipment.  This makes one all the more
frightened, since any lunatic or social deviant could obtain this information,
and use it against anyone.  The processes and techniques herein SHOULD NOT BE
CARRIED OUT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!  SERIOUS HARM OR DEATH COULD OCCUR FROM
ATTEMPTING TO PERFORM ANY OF THE METHODS IN THIS PUBLICATION.  THIS IS MERELY
FOR READING ENJOYMENT, AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR ACTUAL USE!!

Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies feels that it is important that everyone has some
idea of just how easy it is for a terrorist to perform acts of terror; that is
the reason for the existence of this publication.

2.0   BUYING EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS

     Almost any city or town of reasonable size has a gun store and
a pharmacy.  These are two of the places that potential terrorists visit in
order to purchase explosive material.  All that one has to do is know something
about the non-explosive uses of the materials.  Black powder, for example,
is used in blackpowder firearms.  It comes in varying "grades", with each
different grade being a slightly different size.  The grade of black powder
depends on what the calibre of the gun that it is used in; a fine grade of
powder could burn too fast in the wrong caliber weapon.  The rule is:
the smaller the grade, the faster the burn rate of the powder.


2.01   BLACK POWDER


     Black powder is generally available in three grades.  As stated before,
the smaller the grade, the faster the powder burns.  Burn rate is extremely
important in bombs.  Since an explosion is a rapid increase of gas volume in
a confined environment, to make an explosion, a quick-burning powder is
desirable. The three common grades of black powder are listed below, along
with the usual bore width (calibre) of what they are used in.  Generally,
the fastest burning powder, the FFF grade is desirable.  However, the other
grades and uses are listed below:


     GRADE              BORE WIDTH               EXAMPLE OF GUN
     DDDDD              DDDDDDDDDD               DDDDDDDDDDDDDD

     F                  .50 or greater           model cannon; some rifles
     FF                 .36 - .50                large pistols; small rifles
     FFF                .36 or smaller           pistols; derringers


     The FFF grade is the fastest burning, because the smaller grade has
more surface area or burning surface exposed to the flame front.  The larger
grades also have uses which will be discussed later.  The price range of
black powder, per pound, is about $8.50 - $9.00.  The price is not affected
by the grade, and so one saves oneself time and work if one buys the finer
grade of powder.  The major problems with black powder are that it can be
ignited accidentally by static electricity, and that it has a tendency to
absorb moisture from the air.  To safely crush it, a bomber would use a plastic
spoon and a wooden salad bowl.  Taking a small pile at a time, he or she would
apply pressure to the powder through the spoon and rub it in a series of strokes
or circles, but not too hard.  It is fine enough to use when it is about as fine
as flour.  The fineness, however, is dependant on what type of device one wishes
to make; obviously, it would be impracticle to crush enough powder to fill a 1
foot by 4 inch radius pipe.  Anyone can purchase black powder, since anyone can
own black powder firearms in America.


















2.02    PYRODEX


     Pyrodex is a synthetic powder that is used like black powder.  It comes
in the same grades, but it is more expensive per pound.  However, a one pound
container of pyrodex contains more material by volume than a pound of black
powder.  It is much easier to crush to a very fine powder than black powder, and
it is considerably safer and more reliable.  This is because it will
not be set off by static electricity, as black can be, and it is less inclined
to absorb moisture.  It costs about $10.00 per pound.  It can be crushed in the
same manner as black powder, or it can be dissolved in boiling water and dried.


2.03        ROCKET ENGINE POWDER

     One of the most exciting hobbies nowadays is model rocketry.  Estes is
the largest producer of model rocket kits and engines.  Rocket engines are
composed of a single large grain of propellant.  This grain is surrounded by
a fairly heavy cardboard tubing.  One gets the propellant by slitting the tube
lengthwise, and unwrapping it like a paper towel roll.  When this is done, the
grey fire clay at either end of the propellant grain must be removed.  This is
usually done gently with a plastic or brass knife. The material is exceptionally
hard, and must be crushed to be used.  By gripping the grain on the widest
setting on a set of pliers, and putting the grain and powder in a plastic bag,
the powder will not break apart and shatter all over.  This should be done to
all the large chunks of powder, and then it should be crushed like black powder.
Rocket engines come in various sizes, ranging from 1/4 A - 2T to the incredibly
powerful D engines.  The larger the engine, the more expensive.  D engines come
in packages of three, and cost about $5.00 per package.  Rocket engines are
perhaps the single most useful item sold in stores to a terrorist, since they
can be used as is, or can be cannibalized for their explosive powder.


2.04       RIFLE/SHOTGUN POWDER

     Rifle powder and shotgun powder are really the same from a practicle
standpoint. They are both nitrocellulose based propellants. They will be
referred to as gunpowder in all future references. Gunpowder is made by the
action of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid upon cotton. This material is
then dissolved by solvents and then reformed in the desired grain size.  When
dealing with gunpowder, the grain size is not nearly as important as that of
black powder. Both large and small grained gunpowder burn fairly slowly
compared to black powder when unconfined, but when it is confined, gunpowder
burns both hotter and with more gaseous expansion, producing more pressure.
Therefore, the grinding process that is often necessary for other propellants
is not necessary for gunpowder.  Gunpowder costs about $9.00 per pound. Any
idiot can buy it, since there are no restrictions on rifles or shotguns in the
U.S.


2.05       FLASH POWDER


      Flash powder is a mixture of powdered zirconium metal and various
oxidizers. It is extremely sensitive to heat or sparks, and should be treated
with more care than black powder, with which it should NEVER be mixed. It is
sold in small containers which must be mixed and shaken before use. It is very
finely powdered, and is available in three speeds: fast, medium, and slow. The
fast flash powder is the best for using in explosives or detonators.





     It burns very rapidly, regardless of confinement or packing, with a hot
white "flash", hence its name.  It is fairly expensive, costing about $11.00.
It is sold in magic shops and theatre supply stores.


2.06       AMMONIUM NITRATE


     Ammonium nitrate is a high explosive material that is often used as
a commercial "safety explosive"  It is very stable, and is difficult to ignite
with a match. It will only light if the glowing, red-hot part of a match is
touching it. It is also difficult to detonate; (the phenomenon of detonation
will be explained later) it requires a large shockwave to cause it to go high
explosive. Commercially, it is sometimes mixed with a small amount of
nitroglycerine to increase its sensitivity. Ammonium nitrate is used in the
"Cold-Paks" or "Instant Cold", available in most drug stores. The "Cold Paks"
consist of a bag of water, surrounded by a second plastic bag containing the
ammonium nitrate. To get the ammonium nitrate, simply cut off the top of the
outside bag, remove the plastic bag of water, and save the ammonium nitrate in
a well sealed, airtight container, since it is rather hydroscopic, i.e. it
tends to absorb water from the air. It is also the main ingredient in many
fertilizers.


2.1     ACQUIRING CHEMICALS


     The first section deals with getting chemicals legally. This section
deals with "procuring" them. The best place to steal chemicals is a college.
Many state schools have all of their chemicals out on the shelves in the
labs, and more in their chemical stockrooms. Evening is the best time to enter
lab buildings, as there are the least number of people in the buildings, and
most of the labs will still be unlocked. One simply takes a bookbag, wears
a dress shirt and jeans, and tries to resemble a college freshman. If anyone
asks what such a person is doing, the thief can simply say that he is looking
for the  polymer chemistry lab, or some other chemistry-related department
other than the one they are in. One can usually find out where the various
labs and  departments in a building are by calling the university. There
are, of course other techniques for getting into labs after hours, such as
placing a piece of cardboard in the latch of an unused door, such as a back
exit. Then, all one needs to do is come back at a later hour. Also, before
this is done, terrorists check for security systems. If one just walks into a
lab, even if there is someone there, and walks out the back exit, and slip the
cardboard in the latch before the door closes, the person in the lab will never
know what happened. It is also a good idea to observe the building that one
plans to rob at the time that one plans to rob it several days before the
actual theft is done. This is advisable since the would-be thief should know
when and if the campus security makes patrols through buildings. Of course, if
none of these methods are successful, there is always section 2.11, but as a
rule, college campus security is pretty poor, and nobody suspects another
person in the building of doing anything wrong, even if they are there at an
odd hour.


2.11     TECHNIQUES FOR PICKING LOCKS


     If it becomes necessary to pick a lock to enter a lab, the world's
most effective lockpick is dynamite, followed by a sledgehammer.  There are
unfortunately, problems with noise and excess structural damage with these
methods.  The next best thing, however, is a set of army issue lockpicks.





These, unfortunately, are difficult to acquire. If the door to a lab is locked,
but the deadbolt is not engaged, then there are other possibilities. The rule
here is: if one can see the latch, one can open the door. There are several
devices which facilitate freeing the latch from its hole in the wall. Dental
tools, stiff wire ( 20 gauge ), specially bent aluminum from cans, thin pocket-
knives, and credit cards are the tools of the trade. The way that all these
tools and devices are uses is similar: pull, push, or otherwise move the latch
out of its hole in the wall, and pull the door open. This is done by sliding
whatever tool that you are using behind the latch, and pulling the latch out
>From the wall. To make an aluminum-can lockpick, terrorists can use an aluminum
can and carefully cut off the can top and bottom. Cut off the cans' ragged
ends. Then, cut the open-ended cylinder so that it can be flattened out into a
single long rectangle. This should then be cut into inch wide strips. Fold the
strips in 1/4 inch increments (1). One will have a long quadruple-thick 1/4
inch wide strip of aluminum. This should be folded into an L-shape, a J-shape,
or a U-shape. This is done by folding. The pieces would look like this:


 (1)

        _________________________________________________________    v
1/4     |_______________________________________________________|    |
1/4     |_______________________________________________________|    | 1 inch
1/4     |_______________________________________________________|    |
1/4     |_______________________________________________________|    |
                                                                     ^

     Fold along lines to make a single quadruple-thick piece of
aluminum. This should then be folded to produce an L,J,or U shaped
device that looks like this:
                       __________________________________________
                      / ________________________________________|
                     | |

                     | |
                     |_|

                     | |     J-shaped

                     | |________
                      \________|

                       _____________________
                      / ___________________|
                     | |
                     | |
                     | |     U-shaped
                     | |
                     | |____________________
                      \____________________|


     All of these devices should be used to hook the latch of a door and
pull the latch out of its hole.  The folds in the lockpicks will be between
the door and the wall, and so the device will not unfold, if it is made
properly.






2.2      LIST OF USEFUL HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR AVAILABILITY

     Anyone can get many chemicals from hardware stores, supermarkets,
and drug stores to get the materials to make explosives or other dangerous
compounds.  A would-be terrorist would merely need a station wagon and some
money to acquire many of the chemicals named here.

notes: * ethyl alcohol is mixed with methyl alcohol when it is used as a
       solvent. Methyl alcohol is very poisonous. Solvent alcohol must be
       at least 95% ethyl alcohol if it is used to make mercury fulminate.
       Methyl alcohol may prevent mercury fulminate from forming.


     + Ammonia, when bought in stores comes in a variety of forms.  The
       pine and cloudy ammonias should not be bought; only the clear
       ammonia should be used to make ammonium triiodide crystals.


     @ Mercury thermometers are becoming a rarity, unfortunately.  They
       may be hard to find in most stores. Mercury is also used in mercury
       switches, which are available at electronics stores. Mercury is a
       hazardous substance, and should be kept in the thermometer or
       mercury switch until used. It gives off mercury vapors which will
       cause brain damage if inhaled.  For this reason, it is a good idea
       not to spill mercury, and to always use it outdoors. Also, do not
       get it in an open cut; rubber gloves will help prevent this.


     ^ Nitric acid is very difficult to find nowadays.  It is usually
       stolen by bomb makers, or made by the process described in a later
       section.  A desired concentration for making explosives about 70%.


     & The iodine sold in drug stores is usually not the pure crystaline
       form that is desired for producing ammonium triiodide crystals.
       To obtain the pure form, it must usually be acquired by a doctor's
       prescription, but this can be expensive.  Once again, theft is the
       means that terrorists result to.


2.3      PREPARATION OF CHEMICALS

2.31     NITRIC ACID


       There are several ways to make this most essential of all acids for
  explosives. One method by which it could be made will be presented. Once
  again, be reminded that these methods SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT!!

     Materials:                             Equipment:
     DDDDDDDDD                              DDDDDDDDD
     sodium nitrate or                      adjustable heat source
     potassium nitrate
                                            retort
     distilled water
                                            ice bath
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid                          stirring rod

                                            collecting flask with stopper


1) Pour 32 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid into the retort.

2) Carefully weigh out 58 grams of sodium nitrate, or 68 grams of potassium
nitrate. and add this to the acid slowly.  If it all does not dissolve,
carefully stir the solution with a glass rod until it does.






3) Place the open end of the retort into the collecting flask, and place the
   collecting flask in the ice bath.

4) Begin heating the retort, using low heat.  Continue heating until liquid
   begins to come out of the end of the retort.  The liquid that forms is nitric
   acid.  Heat until the precipitate in the bottom of the retort is almost dry,
   or until no more nitric acid is forming.  CAUTION: If the acid is headed too
   strongly, the nitric acid will decompose as soon as it is formed.  This
   can result in the production of highly flammable and toxic gasses that may
   explode.  It is a good idea to set the above apparatus up, and then get
   away from it.


     Potassium nitrate could also be obtained from store-bought black powder,
simply by dissolving black powder in boiling water and filtering out
the sulfur and charcoal. To obtain 68 g of potassium nitrate, it would be
necessary to dissolve about 90 g of black powder in about one litre of
boiling water. Filter the dissolved solution through filter paper in a funnel
into a jar until the liquid that pours through is clear. The charcoal and
sulfur in black powder are insoluble in water, and so when the solution of
water is allowed to evaporate, potassium nitrate will be left in the jar.


2.32     SULFURIC ACID

     Sulfuric acid is far too difficult to make outside of a laboratory or
industrial plant.  However, it is readily available in an uncharged car battery.
A person wishing to make sulfuric acid would simply remove the top of a car
battery and pour the acid into a glass container.  There would probably be
pieces of lead from the battery in the acid which would have to be removed,
either by boiling or filtration.  The concentration of the sulfuric acid can
also be increased by boiling it; very pure sulfuric acid pours slightly faster
than clean motor oil.


2.33     AMMONIUM NITRATE

     Ammonium nitrate is a very powerful but insensitive high-order
explosive. It could be made very easily by pouring nitric acid into a large
flask in an ice bath. Then, by simply pouring household ammonia into the flask
and running away, ammonium nitrate would be formed. After the materials have
stopped reacting, one would simply have to leave the solution in a warm place
until all of the water and any unneutralized ammonia or acid have evaporated.
There would be a fine powder formed, which would be ammonium nitrate. It must
be kept in an airtight container, because of its tendency to pick up water from
the air.  The crystals formed in the above process would have to be heated VERY
gently to drive off the remaining water.


3.0     EXPLOSIVE RECIPES

     Once again, persons reading this material MUST NEVER ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE
ANY OF THE EXPLOSIVES DESCRIBED HEREIN.  IT IS ILLEGAL AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO.  LOSS OF LIFE AND/OR LIMB COULD EASILY OCCUR AS A RESULT
OF ATTEMPTING TO PRODUCE EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS.

     These recipes are theoretically correct, meaning that an individual
could conceivably produce the materials described.  The methods here are usually
scaled-down industrial procedures.







3.01     EXPLOSIVE THEORY

     An explosive is any material that, when ignited by heat or shock,
undergoes rapid decomposition or oxidation.  This process releases energy that
is stored in the material in the form of heat and light, or by breaking down
into gaseous compounds that occupy a much larger volume that the original piece
of material.  Because this expansion is very rapid, large volumes of air are
displaced by the expanding gasses.  This expansion occurs at a speed greater
than the speed of sound, and so a sonic boom occurs.  This explains the
mechanics behind an explosion.  Explosives occur in several forms: high-order
explosives which detonate, low order explosives, which burn, and primers, which
may do both.

     High order explosives detonate.  A detonation occurs only in a high
order explosive.  Detonations are usually incurred by a shockwave that passes
through a block of the high explosive material.  The shockwave breaks apart
the molecular bonds between the atoms of the substance, at a rate approximately
equal to the speed of sound traveling through that material.  In a high
explosive, the fuel and oxodizer are chemically bonded, and the shockwave breaks
apart these bonds, and re-combines the two materials to produce mostly gasses.
T.N.T., ammonium nitrate, and R.D.X. are examples of high order explosives.

     Low order explosives do not detonate; they burn, or undergo oxidation.
when heated, the fuel(s) and oxodizer(s) combine to produce heat, light, and
gaseous products.  Some low order materials burn at about the same speed under
pressure as they do in the open, such as blackpowder. Others, such as gunpowder,
which is correctly called nitrocellulose, burn much faster and hotter when they
are in a confined space, such as the barrel of a firearm; they usually burn
much slower than blackpowder when they are ignited in unpressurized conditions.
Black powder, nitrocellulose, and flash powder are good examples of low order
explosives.

     Primers are peculiarities to the explosive field.  Some of them, such as
mercury filminate, will function as a low or high order explosive.  They are
usually more sensitive to friction, heat, or shock, than the high or low
explosives.  Most primers perform like a high order explosive, except that they
are much more sensitive.  Still others merely burn, but when they are confined,
they burn at a great rate and with a large expansion of gasses and a shockwave.
Primers are usually used in a small amount to initiate, or cause to decompose,
a high order explosive, as in an artillery shell.  But, they are also frequently
used to ignite a low order explosive;  the gunpowder in a bullet is ignited by
the detonation of its primer.


3.1     IMPACT EXPLOSIVES

     Impact explosives are often used as primers.  Of the ones discussed
here, only mercury fulminate and nitroglycerine are real explosives; Ammonium
triiodide crystals decompose upon impact, but they release little heat and no
light.  Impact explosives are always treated with the greatest care, and even
the stupidest anarchist never stores them near any high or low explosives.


3.11    AMMONIUM TRIIODIDE CRYSTALS

     Ammonium triiodide crystals are foul-smelling purple colored crystals
that decompose under the slightest amount of heat, friction, or shock, if they
are made with the purest ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and iodine.  Such
crystals are said to detonate when a fly lands on them, or when an ant walks
across them.  Household ammonia, however, has enough impurities, such as soaps
and abrasive agents, so that the crystals will detonate when thrown,crushed, or





heated.  Upon detonation, a loud report is heard, and a cloud of purple iodine
gas appears about the detonation site.  Whatever the unfortunate surface that
the crystal was detonated upon will usually be ruined, as some of the iodine
in the crystal is thrown about in a solid form, and iodine is corrosive.  It
leaves nasty, ugly, permanent brownish-purple stains on whatever it contacts.
Iodine gas is also bad news, since it can damage lungs, and it settles to the
ground and stains things there also.  Touching iodine leaves brown stains on
the skin that last for about a week, unless they are immediately and vigorously
washed off.  While such a compound would have little use to a serious terrorist,
a vandal could utilize them in damaging property.  Or, a terrorist could throw
several of them into a crowd as a distraction, an action which would possibly
injure a few people, but frighten almost anyone, since a small crystal that
not be seen when thrown produces a rather loud explosion.  Ammonium triiodide
crystals could be produced in the following manner:

     Materials                Equipment
     DDDDDDDDD                DDDDDDDDD

     iodine crystals          funnel and filter paper

                              paper towels
     clear ammonia
     (ammonium hydroxide,     two throw-away glass jars
      for the suicidal)


1) Place about two teaspoons of iodine into one of the glass jars.  The jars
   must both be throw away because they will never be clean again.

2) Add enough ammonia to completely cover the iodine.

3) Place the funnel into the other jar, and put the filter paper in the funnel.
   The technique for putting filter paper in a funnel is taught in every basic
   chemistry lab class: fold the circular paper in half, so that a semi-circle
   is formed.  Then, fold it in half again to form a triangle with one curved
   side.  Pull one thickness of paper out to form a cone, and place the cone
   into the funnel.

4) After allowing the iodine to soak in the ammonia for a while, pour the
   solution into the paper in the funnel through the filter paper.

5) While the solution is being filtered, put more ammonia into the first jar
   to wash any remaining crystals into the funnel as soon as it drains.

6) Collect all the purplish crystals without touching the brown filter paper,
   and place them on the paper towels to dry for about an hour.  Make sure that
   they are not too close to any lights or other sources of heat, as they could
   well detonate. While they are still wet, divide the wet material into about
   eight chunks.

7) After they dry, gently place the crystals onto a one square inch piece of
   duct tape.  Cover it with a similar piece, and gently press the duct tape
   together around the crystal, making sure not to press the crystal itself.
   Finally, cut away most of the excess duct tape with a pair of scissors, and
   store the crystals in a cool dry safe place.  They have a shelf life of
   about a week, and they should be stored in individual containers that can be
   thrown away, since they have a tendency to slowly decompose, a process which
   gives off iodine vapors, which will stain whatever they settle on.  One
   possible way to increase their shelf life is to store them in airtight
   containers.  To use them, simply throw them against any surface or place them
   where they will be stepped on or crushed.






3.12      MERCURY FULMINATE


     Mercury fulminate is perhaps one of the oldest known initiating
compounds.  It can be detonated by either heat or shock, which would make it
of infinite value to a terrorist.  Even the action of dropping a crystal of
the fulminate causes it to explode.  A person making this material would
probably use the following procedure:



     MATERIALS                  EQUIPMENT
     DDDDDDDDD                  DDDDDDDDD

     mercury (5 g)              glass stirring rod

     concentrated nitric        100 ml beaker (2)
     acid (35 ml)
                                adjustable heat
     ethyl alcohol (30 ml)      source

     distilled water            blue litmus paper

                                funnel and filter paper



1) In one beaker, mix 5 g of mercury with 35 ml of concentrated nitric acid,
   using the glass rod.

2) Slowly heat the mixture until the mercury is dissolved, which is when the
   solution turns green and boils.

3) Place 30 ml of ethyl alcohol into the second beaker, and slowly and carefully
    add all of the contents of the first beaker to it.  Red and/or brown fumes
   should appear. These fumes are toxic and flammable.

4) After thirty to forty minutes, the fumes should turn white, indicating that
   the reaction is near completion.  After ten more minutes, add 30 ml of the
   distilled water to the solution.

5) Carefully filter out the crystals of mercury fulminate from the liquid
   solution.  Dispose of the solution in a safe place, as it is corrosive
   and toxic.

6) Wash the crystals several times in distilled water to remove as much excess
   acid as possible.  Test the crystals with the litmus paper until they are
   neutral.   This will be when the litmus paper stays blue when it touches the
   wet crystals

7) Allow the crystals to dry, and store them in a safe place, far away from
   any explosive or flammable material.


       This procedure can also be done by volume, if the available mercury
  cannot be weighed.  Simply use 10 volumes of nitric acid and 10 volumes of
  ethanol to every one volume of mercury.








3.13       NITROGLYCERINE

     Nitroglycerine is one of the most sensitive explosives, if it is not
the most sensitive.  Although it is possible to make it safely, it is difficult.
Many a young anarchist has been killed or seriously injured while trying to
make the stuff.  When Nobel's factories make it, many people were killed by the
all-to-frequent factory explosions.  Usually, as soon as it is made, it is
converted into a safer substance, such as dynamite.  An idiot who attempts
to make nitroglycerine would use the following procedure:


     MATERIAL               EQUIPMENT
     DDDDDDDD               DDDDDDDDD

     distilled water        eye-dropper

     table salt             100 ml beaker

     sodium bicarbonate     200-300 ml beakers (2)

     concentrated nitric    ice bath container
     acid (13 ml)           ( a plastic bucket serves well )

     concentrated sulfuric  centigrade thermometer
     acid (39 ml)
                             blue litmus paper
     glycerine


1) Place 150 ml of distilled water into one of the 200-300 ml beakers.

2) In the other 200-300 ml beaker, place 150 ml of distilled water and about
   a spoonful of sodium bicarbonate, and stir them until the sodium bicarbonate
   dissolves.  Do not put so much sodium bicarbonate in the water so that some
   remains undissolved.

3) Create an ice bath by half filling the ice bath container with ice, and
   adding table salt.  This will cause the ice to melt, lowering the overall
   temperature.

4) Place the 100 ml beaker into the ice bath, and pour the 13 ml of concentrated
   nitric acid into the 100 ml beaker.  Be sure that the beaker will not spill
   into the ice bath, and that the ice bath will not overflow into the beaker
   when more materials are added to it.  Be sure to have a large enough ice bath
   container to add more ice.  Bring the temperature of the acid down to about 20
   degrees centigrade or less.

5) When the nitric acid is as cold as stated above, slowly and carefully add the
   39 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the nitric acid.  Mix the two acids
   together, and cool the mixed acids to 10 degrees centigrade.  It is a good
   idea to start another ice bath to do this.

6) With the eyedropper, slowly put the glycerine into the mixed acids, one drop
   at a time.  Hold the thermometer along the top of the mixture where the mixed
   acids and glycerine meet.  DO NOT ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE TO GET ABOVE 30
   DEGREES CENTIGRADE; IF THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THIS TEMPERATURE, RUN
   LIKE HELL!!!  The glycerine will start to nitrate immediately, and the
   temperature will immediately begin to rise.  Add glycerine until there is a
   thin layer of glycerine on top of the mixed acids.  It is always safest to
   make any explosive in small quantities.






7) Stir the mixed acids and glycerine for the first ten minutes of nitration,
   adding ice and salt to the ice bath to keep the temperature of the solution
   in the 100 ml beaker well below 30 degrees centigrade.  Usually, the
   nitroglycerine will form on the top of the mixed acid solution, and the
   concentrated sulfuric acid will absorb the water produced by the reaction.

8) When the reaction is over, and when the nitroglycerine is well below 30
   degrees centigrade, slowly and carefully pour the solution of nitroglycerine
   and mixed acid into the distilled water in the beaker in step 1.  The
   nitroglycerine should settle to the bottom of the beaker, and the water-acid
   solution on top can be poured off and disposed of. Drain as much of the
   acid-water solution as possible without disturbing the nitroglycerine.

9) Carefully remove the nitroglycerine with a clean eye-dropper, and place it
   into the beaker in step 2.  The sodium bicarbonate solution will eliminate
   much of the acid, which will make the nitroglycerine more stable, and less
   likely to explode for no reason, which it can do.  Test the nitroglycerine
   with the litmus paper until the litmus stays blue.  Repeat this step if
   necessary, and use new sodium bicarbonate solutions as in step 2.

10) When the nitroglycerine is as acid-free as possible, store it in a clean
    container in a safe place.  The best place to store nitroglycerine is
    far away from anything living, or from anything of any value.
    Nitroglycerine can explode for no apparent reason, even if it is stored
    in a secure cool place.


3.14     PICRATES

     Although the procedure for the production of picric acid, or
trinitrophenol has not yet been given, its salts are described first, since they
are extremely sensitive, and detonate on impact.  By mixing picric acid with
metal hydroxides, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, and evaporating the
water, metal picrates can be formed.  Simply obtain picric acid, or produce it,
and mix it with a solution of (preferably) potassium hydroxide, of a mid range
molarity.  (about 6-9 M)  This material, potassium picrate, is impact-sensitive,
and can be used as an initiator for any type of high explosive.

3.2      LOW-ORDER EXPLOSIVES

     There are many low-order explosives that can be purchased in gun
stores and used in explosive devices. However, it is possible that a wise
wise store owner would not sell these substances to a suspicious-looking
individual. Such an individual would then be forced to resort to making
his own low-order explosives.


3.21     BLACK POWDER


     First made by the Chinese for use in fireworks, black powder was first
used in weapons and explosives in the 12th century.  It is very simple to make,
but it is not very powerful or safe.  Only about 50% of black powder is
converted to hot gasses when it is burned; the other half is mostly very fine
burned particles.  Black powder has one major problem: it can be ignited by
static electricity.  This is very bad, and it means that the material must be
made with wooden or clay tools.  Anyway, a misguided individual could
manufacture black powder at home with the following procedure:








     MATERIALS               EQUIPMENT
     DDDDDDDDD               DDDDDDDDD
     potassium               clay grinding bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and clay grinder

       or                         or

     sodium                  wooden salad bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and wooden spoon

     sulfur (10 g)           plastic bags (3)

     charcoal (15 g)         300-500 ml beaker (1)

     distilled water         coffee pot or heat source


1) Place a small amount of the potassium or sodium nitrate in the grinding bowl
   and grind it to a very fine powder.  Do this to all of the potassium or
   sodium nitrate, and store the ground powder in one of the plastic bags.

2) Do the same thing to the sulfur and charcoal, storing each chemical in a
   separate plastic bag.

3) Place all of the finely ground potassium or sodium nitrate in the beaker, and
    add just enough boiling water to the chemical to get it all wet.

4) Add the contents of the other plastic bags to the wet potassium or sodium
   nitrate, and mix them well for several minutes.  Do this until there is no
   more visible sulfur or charcoal, or until the mixture is universally black.

5) On a warm sunny day, put the beaker outside in the direct sunlight.  Sunlight
   is really the best way to dry black powder, since it is never too hot, but it
   is hot enough to evaporate the water.

6) Scrape the black powder out of the beaker, and store it in a safe container.
   Plastic is really the safest container, followed by paper.  Never store black
   powder in a plastic bag, since plastic bags are prone to generate static
   electricity.


3.22     NITROCELLULOSE

     Nitrocellulose is usually called "gunpowder" or "guncotton".  It is more
stable than black powder, and it produces a much greater volume of hot gas.  It
also burns much faster than black powder when it is in a confined space.
Finally, nitrocellulose is fairly easy to make, as outlined by the following
procedure:


     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
     DDDDDDDDD                    DDDDDDDDD
     cotton  (cellulose)          two (2) 200-300 ml beakers

     concentrated                 funnel and filter paper
     nitric acid
                                  blue litmus paper
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid

     distilled water





1) Pour 10 cc of concentrated sulfuric acid into the beaker.  Add to this
   10 cc of concentrated nitric acid.

2) Immediately add 0.5 gm of cotton, and allow it to soak for exactly 3
   minutes.

3) Remove the nitrocotton, and transfer it to a beaker of distilled water
   to wash it in.

4) Allow the material to dry, and then re-wash it.

5) After the cotton is neutral when tested with litmus paper, it is ready to
   be dried and stored.


3.23     FUEL-OXODIZER MIXTURES

     There are nearly an infinite number of fuel-oxodizer mixtures that can
be produced by a misguided individual in his own home.  Some are very effective
and dangerous, while others are safer and less effective.  A list of working
fuel-oxodizer mixtures will be presented, but the exact measurements of each
compound are debatable for maximum effectiveness.  A rough estimate will be
given of the percentages of each fuel and oxodizer:

================================================================================

NOTE: Mixtures that uses substitutions of sodium perchlorate for potassium
      perchlorate become moisture-absorbent and less stable.

     The higher the speed number, the faster the fuel-oxodizer mixture burns
AFTER ignition.  Also, as a rule, the finer the powder, the faster the rate of
burning.

     As one can easily see, there is a wide variety of fuel-oxodizer mixtures
that can be made at home.  By altering the amounts of fuel and oxodizer(s),
different burn rates can be achieved, but this also can change the sensitivity
of the mixture.


3.24    PERCHLORATES

     As a rule, any oxidizable material that is treated with perchloric acid
will become a low order explosive.  Metals, however, such as potassium or
sodium, become excellent bases for flash-type powders.  Some materials that can
be perchlorated are cotton, paper, and sawdust.  To produce potassium or sodium
perchlorate, simply acquire the hydroxide of that metal, e.g. sodium or
potassium hydroxide.  It is a good idea to test the material to be perchlorated
with a very small amount of acid, since some of the materials tend to react
explosively when contacted by the acid.  Solutions of sodium or potassium
hydroxide are ideal.





3.3     HIGH-ORDER EXPLOSIVES

     High order explosives can be made in the home without too much
difficulty.  The main problem is acquiring the nitric acid to produce the high
explosive.  Most high explosives detonate because their molecular structure is
made up of some fuel and usually three or more NO2 ( nitrogen dioxide )
molecules.  T.N.T., or Tri-Nitro-Toluene is an excellent example of such a
material.  When a shock wave passes through an molecule of T.N.T., the
nitrogen dioxide bond is broken, and the oxygen combines with the fuel, all in
a matter of microseconds.  This accounts for the great power of nitrogen-based
explosives.  Remembering that these procedures are NEVER TO BE CARRIED OUT,
several methods of manufacturing high-order explosives in the home are listed.



3.31     R.D.X.

     R.D.X., also called cyclonite, or composition C-1 (when mixed with
plasticisers) is one of the most valuable of all military explosives.  This is
because it has more than 150% of the power of T.N.T., and is much easier to
detonate.  It should not be used alone, since it can be set off by a not-too
severe shock.  It is less sensitive than mercury fulminate, or nitroglycerine,
but it is still too sensitive to be used alone.  R.D.X. can be made by the
surprisingly simple method outlined hereafter.  It is much easier to make in the
home than all other high explosives, with the possible exception of ammonium
nitrate.

1) Place the beaker in the ice bath, (see section 3.13, steps 3-4) and carefully
    pour 550 ml of concentrated nitric acid into the beaker.

2) When the acid has cooled to below 20 degrees centigrade, add small amounts of
   the crushed fuel tablets to the beaker.  The temperature will rise, and it
   must be kept below 30 degrees centigrade, or dire consequences could result.
   Stir the mixture.

3) Drop the temperature below zero degrees centigrade, either by adding more ice
   and salt to the old ice bath, or by creating a new ice bath.  Or, ammonium
   nitrate could be added to the old ice bath, since it becomes cold when it is
   put in water. Continue stirring the mixture, keeping the temperature below
   zero degrees centigrade for at least twenty minutes






4) Pour the mixture into a litre of crushed ice.  Shake and stir the mixture,
   and allow it to melt.  Once it has melted, filter out the crystals, and
   dispose of the corrosive liquid.

5) Place the crystals into one half a litre of boiling distilled water.  Filter
   the crystals, and test them with the blue litmus paper.  Repeat steps 4 and 5
   until the litmus paper remains blue.  This will make the crystals more stable
   and safe.

6) Store the crystals wet until ready for use. Allow them to dry completely
   using them. R.D.X. is not stable enough to use alone as an explosive.

7) Composition C-1 can be made by mixing 88.3% R.D.X. (by weight) with 11.1%
   mineral oil, and 0.6% lecithin. Kneed these material together in a plastic
   bag. This is a good way to desensitize the explosive.

8) H.M.X. is a mixture of T.N.T. and R.D.X.; the ratio is 50/50, by weight.
   it is not as sensitive, and is almost as powerful as straight R.D.X.

9) By adding ammonium nitrate to the crystals of R.D.X. after step 5, it should
   be possible to desensitize the R.D.X. and increase its power, since ammonium
   nitrate is very insensitive and powerful. Soduim or potassium nitrate could
   also be added; a small quantity is sufficient to stabilize the R.D.X.

10) R.D.X. detonates at a rate of 8550 meters/second when it is compressed to a
    density of 1.55 g/cubic cm.


3.32      AMMONIUM NITRATE

     Ammonium nitrate could be made by a terrorist according to the hap-
hazard method in section 2.33, or it could be stolen from a construction site,
since it is usually used in blasting, because it is very stable and insensitive
to shock and heat.  A terrorist could also buy several Instant Cold-Paks from a
drug store or medical supply store.  The major disadvantage with ammonium
nitrate, from a terrorist's point of view, would be detonating it.  A rather
powerful priming charge must be used, and usually with a booster charge.  The
diagram below will explain.

          _________________________________________
          |       |                               |

          |_______|_______________________________|

     The primer explodes, detonating the T.N.T., which detonates, sending
     a tremendous shockwave through the ammonium nitrate, detonating it.


3.33     ANFOS

     ANFO is an acronym for Ammonium Nitrate - Fuel Oil Solution.  An ANFO
solves the only other major problem with ammonium nitrate: its tendency to pick
up water vapor from the air.  This results in the explosive failing to detonate
when such an attempt is made.  This is rectified by mixing 94% (by weight)
ammonium nitrate with 6% fuel oil, or kerosene.  The kerosene keeps the ammonium
nitrate from absorbing moisture from the air.  An ANFO also requires a large
shockwave to set it off.





3.34       T.N.T.


     T.N.T., or Tri-Nitro-Toluene, is perhaps the second oldest known high
explosive. Dynamite, of course, was the first. It is certainly the best known
high explosive, since it has been popularized by early morning cartoons. It
is the standard for comparing other explosives to, since it is the most well
known. In industry, a T.N.T. is made by a three step nitration process that is
designed to conserve the nitric and sulfuric acids which are used to make the
product. A terrorist, however, would probably opt for the less economical one
step method. The one step process is performed by treating toluene with very
strong (fuming) sulfuric acid. Then, the sulfated toluene is treated with very
strong (fuming) nitric acid in an ice bath. Cold water is added the solution,
and it is filtered.



3.35     POTASSIUM CHLORATE


     Potassium chlorate itself cannot be made in the home, but it can be
obtained from labs.  If potassium chlorate is mixed with a small amount of
vaseline, or other petroleum jelly, and a shockwave is passed through it, the
material will detonate with slightly more power than black powder.  It must,
however, be confined to detonate it in this manner.  The procedure for making
such an explosive is outlined below:



     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
     DDDDDDDDD                    DDDDDDDDD


     potassium chlorate           zip-lock plastic bag
     (9 parts, by volume)

     petroleum jelly              clay grinding bowl
     (vaseline)                          or
     (1 part, by volume)          wooden bowl and wooden spoon



1)  Grind the potassium chlorate in the grinding bowl carefully and slowly,
    until the potassium chlorate is a very fine powder.  The finer that it is
    powdered, the faster (better)  it will detonate.

2)  Place the powder into the plastic bag.  Put the petroleum jelly into the
    plastic bag, getting as little on the sides of the bag as possible, i.e.
    put the vaseline on the potassium chlorate powder.

3)  Close the bag, and kneed the materials together until none of the potassium
    chlorate is dry powder that does not stick to the main glob.  If necessary,
    add a bit more petroleum jelly to the bag.

4)  The material must me used within 24 hours, or the mixture will react to
    greatly reduce the effectiveness of the explosive.  This reaction, however,
    is harmless, and releases no heat or dangerous products.









3.36     DYNAMITE

     The name dynamite comes from the Greek word "dynamis", meaning power.
Dynamite was invented by Nobel shortly after he made nitroglycerine. It was
made because nitroglycerine was so dangerously sensitive to shock. A misguided
individual with some sanity would, after making nitroglycerine (an insane act)
would immediately convert it to dynamite. This can be done by adding various
materials to the nitroglycerine, such as sawdust. The sawdust holds a large
weight of nitroglycerine per volume. Other materials, such as ammonium nitrate
could be added, and they would tend to desensitize the explosive, and increase
the power.  But even these nitroglycerine compounds are not really safe.



3.37     NITROSTARCH EXPLOSIVES


     Nitrostarch explosives are simple to make, and are fairly powerful.  All
that need be done is treat various starches with a mixture of concentrated nitric
and sulfuric acids.  10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid is added to 10 ml of
concentrated nitric acid.  To this mixture is added 0.5 grams of starch.  Cold
water is added, and the apparently unchanged nitrostarch is filtered out.
Nitrostarch explosives are of slightly lower power than T.N.T., but they are
more readily detonated.



3.38     PICRIC ACID


     Picric acid, also known as Tri-Nitro-Phenol, or T.N.P., is a military
explosive that is most often used as a booster charge to set off another less
sensitive explosive, such as T.N.T.  It another explosive that is fairly simple
to make, assuming that one can acquire the concentrated sulfuric and nitric
acids.  Its procedure for manufacture is given in many college chemistry lab
manuals, and is easy to follow.  The main problem with picric acid is its
tendency to form dangerously sensitive and unstable picrate salts, such as
potassium picrate.  For this reason, it is usually made into a safer form, such
as ammonium picrate, also called explosive D.  A social deviant would probably
use a formula similar to the one presented here to make picric acid.




     MATERIALS                         EQUIPMENT
     DDDDDDDDD                         DDDDDDDDD

     phenol (9.5 g)                    500 ml flask

     concentrated                      adjustable heat source
     sulfuric acid (12.5 ml)
                                       1000 ml beaker
     concentrated nitric               or other container
     acid (38 ml)                      suitable for boiling in

     distilled water                   filter paper
                                       and funnel

                                       glass stirring rod







1) Place 9.5 grams of phenol into the 500 ml flask, and carefully add 12.5
   ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and stir the mixture.

2) Put 400 ml of tap water into the 1000 ml beaker or boiling container and
   bring the water to a gentle boil.

3) After warming the 500 ml flask under hot tap water, place it in the boiling
   water, and continue to stir the mixture of phenol and acid for about thirty
   minutes.  After thirty minutes, take the flask out, and allow it to cool for
   about five minutes.

4) Pour out the boiling water used above, and after allowing the container to
   cool, use it to create an ice bath, similar to the one used in section 3.13,
   steps 3-4.  Place the 500 ml flask with the mixed acid an phenol in the ice
   bath.  Add 38 ml of concentrated nitric acid in small amounts, stirring the
   mixture constantly.  A vigorous but "harmless" reaction should occur.  When
   the mixture stops reacting vigorously, take the flask out of the ice bath.

5) Warm the ice bath container, if it is glass, and then begin boiling more tap
   water.  Place the flask containing the mixture in the boiling water, and heat
   it in the boiling water for 1.5 to 2 hours.

6) Add 100 ml of cold distilled water to the solution, and chill it in an ice
   bath until it is cold.

7) Filter out the yellowish-white picric acid crystals by pouring the solution
   through the filter paper in the funnel.  Collect the liquid and dispose of it
   in a safe place, since it is corrosive.

8) Wash out the 500 ml flask with distilled water, and put the contents of the
   filter paper in the flask.  Add 300 ml of water, and shake vigorously.

9) Re-filter the crystals, and allow them to dry.

10) Store the crystals in a safe place in a glass container, since they will
    react with metal containers to produce picrates that could explode
    spontaneously.


3.39     AMMONIUM PICRATE


     Ammonium picrate, also called Explosive D, is another safety explosive.
It requires a substantial shock to cause it to detonate, slightly less than that
required to detonate ammonium nitrate.  It is much safer than picric acid, since
it has little tendency to form hazardous unstable salts when placed in metal
containers.  It is simple to make from picric acid and clear household ammonia.
All that need be done is put the picric acid crystals into a glass container and
dissolve them in a great quantity of hot water.  Add clear household ammonia in
excess, and allow the excess ammonia to evaporate.  The powder remaining should
be ammonium picrate.


3.40   NITROGEN TRICHLORIDE


     Nitrogen trichloride, also known as chloride of azode, is an oily yellow
liquid.  It explodes violently when it is heated above 60 degrees celsius, or
when it comes in contact with an open flame or spark.  It is fairly simple to
produce.






1)  In a beaker, dissolve about 5 teaspoons of ammonium nitrate in water.
    Do not put so much ammonium nitrate into the solution that some of it
    remains undissolved in the bottom of the beaker.

2)  Collect a quantity of chlorine gas in a second beaker by mixing hydrochloric
    acid with potassium permanganate in a large flask with a stopper and glass
    pipe.

3)  Place the beaker containing the chlorine gas upside down on top of the
    beaker containing the ammonium nitrate solution, and tape the beakers
    together.  Gently heat the bottom beaker.  When this is done, oily yellow
    droplets will begin to form on the surface of the solution, and sink down
    to the bottom.  At this time, remove the heat source immediately.

    Alternately, the chlorine can be bubbled through the ammonium nitrate
    solution, rather than collecting the gas in a beaker, but this requires
    timing and a stand to hold the beaker and test tube.

    The chlorine gas can also be mixed with anhydrous ammonia gas, by gently
    heating a flask filled with clear household ammonia.  Place the glass tubes
    from the chlorine-generating flask and the tube from the ammonia-generating
    flask in another flask that contains water.

4)  Collect the yellow droplets with an eyedropper, and use them immediately,
    since nitrogen trichloride decomposes in 24 hours.


3.41     LEAD AZIDE

     Lead Azide is a material that is often used as a booster charge for
other explosive, but it does well enough on its own as a fairly sensitive
explosive.  It does not detonate too easily by percussion or impact, but it
is easily detonated by heat from an igniter wire, or a blasting cap.  It is
simple to produce, assuming that the necessary chemicals can be procured.

     By dissolving sodium azide and lead acetate in water in separate
beakers, the two materials are put into an aqueous state.  Mix the two beakers
together, and apply a gentle heat. Add an excess of the lead acetate
solution, until no reaction occurs, and the precipitate on the bottom of the
beaker stops forming.  Filter off the solution, and wash the precipitate in
hot water. The precipitate is lead azide, and it must be stored wet for safety.
If lead acetate cannot be found, simply acquire acetic acid, and put lead
metal in it. Black powder bullets work well for this purpose.


3.5     OTHER "EXPLOSIVES"

     The remaining section covers the other types of materials that can
be used to destroy property by fire.  Although none of the materials
presented here are explosives, they still produce explosive-style results.

3.51     THERMIT

     Thermit is a fuel-oxodizer mixture that is used to generate tremendous
amounts of heat. It was not presented in section 3.23 because it does not react
nearly as readily. It is a mixture of iron oxide and aluminum, both finely
powdered. When it is ignited, the aluminum burns, and extracts the oxygen from
the iron oxide. This is really two very exothermic reactions that produce a
combined temperature of about 2200 degrees C. This is half the heat produced by
an atomic weapon. It is difficult to ignite, however, but when it is ignited,
it is one of the most effective firestarters around.





     MATERIALS
     DDDDDDDDD

     powdered aluminum (10 g)

     powdered iron oxide (10 g)


1) There is no special procedure or equipment required to make thermit.  Simply
   mix the two powders together, and try to make the mixture as homogenous as
   possible.  The ratio of iron oxide to aluminum is 50% / 50% by weight, and
   be made in greater or lesser amounts.

2) Ignition of thermite can be accomplished by adding a small amount of
   potassium chlorate to the thermit, and pouring a few drops of sulfuric acid
   on it.  This method and others will be discussed later in section 4.33.  The
   other method of igniting thermit is with a magnesium strip.  Finally, by
   using common sparkler-type fireworks placed in the thermit, the mixture
   can be ignited.


3.52     MOLOTOV COCKTAILS


     First used by Russians against German tanks, the Molotov cocktail is now
exclusively used by terrorists worldwide. They are extremely simple to make, and
can produce devastating results. By taking any highly flammable material, such
as gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, ethyl or methyl alcohol, lighter fluid,
turpentine, or any mixture of the above, and putting it into a large glass
bottle, anyone can make an effective firebomb. After putting the flammable
liquid in the bottle, simply put a piece of cloth that is soaked in the liquid
in the top of the bottle so that it fits tightly. Then, wrap some of the cloth
around the neck and tie it, but be sure to leave a few inches of lose cloth to
light. Light the exposed cloth, and throw the bottle. If the burning cloth
does not go out, and if the bottle breaks on impact, the contents of the bottle
will spatter over a large area near the site of impact, and burst into flame.
Flammable mixtures such as kerosene and motor oil should be mixed with a more
volatile and flammable liquid, such as gasoline, to insure ignition. A mixture
such as tar or grease and gasoline will stick to the surface that it strikes,
and burn hotter, and be more difficult to extinguish. A mixture such as this
must be shaken well before it is lit and thrown



3.53     CHEMICAL FIRE BOTTLE

     The chemical fire bottle is really an advanced molotov cocktail.  Rather
than using the burning cloth to ignite the flammable liquid, which has at best
a fair chance of igniting the liquid, the chemical fire bottle utilizes the very
hot and violent reaction between sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate.  When the
container breaks, the sulfuric acid in the mixture of gasoline sprays onto the
paper soaked in potassium chlorate and sugar.  The paper, when struck by the
acid, instantly bursts into a white flame, igniting the gasoline.  The chance
of failure to ignite the gasoline is less than 2%, and can be reduced to 0%, if
there is enough potassium chlorate and sugar to spare.











     MATERIALS                         EQUIPMENT
     DDDDDDDDD                         DDDDDDDDD

     potassium chlorate               glass bottle
     (2 teaspoons)                    (12 oz.)

     sugar (2 teaspoons)              cap for bottle,
                                      with plastic inside

     concentrated                     cooking pan with raised
     sulfuric acid (4 oz.)            edges

     gasoline (8 oz.)                 paper towels

                                      glass or plastic cup
                                      and spoon



1) Test the cap of the bottle with a few drops of sulfuric acid to make sure
   that the acid will not eat away the bottle cap during storage.  If the
   acid eats through it in 24 hours, a new top must be found and tested, until
   a cap that the acid does not eat through is found.  A glass top is excellent.

2) Carefully pour 8 oz. of gasoline into the glass bottle.

3) Carefully pour 4 oz. of concentrated sulfuric acid into the glass bottle.
   Wipe up any spills of acid on the sides of the bottle, and screw the cap on
   the bottle.  Wash the bottle's outside with plenty of water.  Set it aside
   to dry.

4) Put about two teaspoons of potassium chlorate and about two teaspoons of
   sugar into the glass or plastic cup.  Add about 1/2 cup of boiling water,
   or enough to dissolve all of the potassium chlorate and sugar.

5) Place a sheet of paper towel in the cooking pan with raised edges.  Fold
   the paper towel in half, and pour the solution of dissolved potassium
   chlorate and sugar on it until it is thoroughly wet.  Allow the towel to
   dry.

6) When it is dry, put some glue on the outside of the glass bottle containing
   the gasoline and sulfuric acid mixture.  Wrap the paper towel around the
   bottle, making sure that it sticks to it in all places.  Store the bottle
   in a place where it will not be broken or tipped over.

7) When finished, the solution in the bottle should appear as two distinct
   liquids, a dark brownish-red solution on the bottom, and a clear solution
   on top.  The two solutions will not mix.  To use the chemical fire bottle,
   simply throw it at any hard surface.

8) NEVER OPEN THE BOTTLE, SINCE SOME SULFURIC ACID MIGHT BE ON THE CAP, WHICH
   COULD TRICKLE DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND IGNITE THE POTASSIUM CHLORATE,
   CAUSING A FIRE AND/OR EXPLOSION.

9) To test the device, tear a small piece of the paper towel off the bottle,
   and put a few drops of sulfuric acid on it.  The paper towel should
   immediately burst into a white flame.









3.54     BOTTLED GAS EXPLOSIVES


     Bottled gas, such as butane for refilling lighters, propane for propane
stoves or for bunsen burners, can be used to produce a powerful explosion. To
make such a device, all that a simple-minded anarchist would have to do would be
to take his container of bottled gas and place it above a can of Sterno or other
gelatinized fuel, and light the fuel and run. Depending on the fuel used, and
on the thickness of the fuel container, the liquid gas will boil and expand to
the point of bursting the container in about five minutes. In theory, the gas
would immediately be ignited by the burning gelatinized fuel, producing a large
fireball and explosion. Unfortunately, the bursting of the bottled gas container
often puts out the fuel, thus preventing the expanding gas from igniting.  By
using a metal bucket half filled with gasoline, however, the chances of ignition
are better, since the gasoline is less likely to be extinguished.  Placing the
canister of bottled gas on a bed of burning charcoal soaked in gasoline would
probably be the most effective way of securing ignition of the expanding gas,
since although the bursting of the gas container may blow out the flame of the
gasoline, the burning charcoal should immediately re-ignite it.  Nitrous oxide,
hydrogen, propane, acetylene, or any other flammable gas will do nicely.



4.0     USING EXPLOSIVES


     Once a terrorist has made his explosives, the next logical step is to
apply them. Explosives have a wide range of uses, from harassment, to vandalism,
to murder. NONE OF THE IDEAS PRESENTED HERE ARE EVER TO BE CARRIED OUT, EITHER
IN PART OR IN FULL!  DOING SO CAN LEAD TO PROSECUTION, FINES, AND IMPRISONMENT!
     The first step that a person that would use explosive would take would
be to determine how big an explosive device would be needed to do whatever had
to be done. Then, he would have to decide what to make his bomb with. He would
also have to decide on how he wanted to detonate the device, and determine
where the best placement for it would be. Then, it would be necessary to see
if the device could be put where he wanted it without it being discovered or
moved. Finally, he would actually have to sit down and build his explosive
device. These are some of the topics covered in the next section.


4.1     SAFETY

     There is no such thing as a "safe" explosive device.  One can only speak
in terms of relative safety, or less unsafe.


4.2     IGNITION DEVICES

     There are many ways to ignite explosive devices.  There is the classic
"light the fuse, throw the bomb, and run" approach, and there are sensitive
mercury switches, and many things in between.  Generally, electrical detonation
systems are safer than fuses, but there are times when fuses are more
appropriate than electrical systems; it is difficult to carry an electrical
detonation system into a stadium, for instance, without being caught.  A device
with a fuse or impact detonating fuse would be easier to hide.









4.21     FUSE IGNITION


     The oldest form of explosive ignition, fuses are perhaps the favorite
type of simple ignition system.  By simply placing a piece of waterproof fuse in
a device, one can have almost guaranteed ignition.  Modern waterproof fuse is
extremely reliable, burning at a rate of about 2.5 seconds to the inch.  It is
available as model rocketry fuse in most hobby shops, and costs about $3.00 for
a nine-foot length.  Fuse is a popular ignition system for pipe bombers because
of its simplicity.  All that need be done is light it with a match or lighter.
     Of course, if the Army had fuses like this, then the grenade, which uses
fuse ignition, would be very impracticle.  If a grenade ignition system can be
acquired, by all means, it is the most effective.  But, since such things do not
just float around, the next best thing is to prepare a fuse system which does
not require the use of a match or lighter, but still retains its simplicity.
One such method is described below:


     MATERIALS
     _________

     strike-on-cover type matches

     electrical tape or duct tape

     waterproof fuse

1) To determine the burn rate of a particular type of fuse, simply measure a
   6 inch or longer piece of fuse and ignite it.  With a stopwatch, press the
   start button the at the instant when the fuse lights, and stop the watch when
   the fuse reaches its end.  Divide the time of burn by the length of fuse, and
   you have the burn rate of the fuse, in seconds per inch.  This will be shown
   below:

     Suppose an eight inch piece of fuse is burned, and its complete time
     of combustion is 20 seconds.



     20 seconds
     DDDDDDDDDD  = 2.5 seconds per inch.
     8 inches


     If a delay of 10 seconds was desired with this fuse, divide the desired
      time by the number of seconds per inch:

     10 seconds
     DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD = 4 inches
     2.5 seconds / inch

NOTE: THE LENGTH OF FUSE HERE MEANS LENGTH OF FUSE TO THE POWDER.  SOME FUSE,
      AT LEAST AN INCH, SHOULD BE INSIDE THE DEVICE.  ALWAYS ADD THIS EXTRA
      INCH, AND PUT THIS EXTRA INCH AN INCH INTO THE DEVICE!!!


2) After deciding how long a delay is desired before the explosive device is
   to go off, add about 1/2 an inch to the premeasured amount of fuse, and
   cut it off.






3) Carefully remove the cardboard matches from the paper match case.  Do not
   pull off individual matches; keep all the matches attached to the cardboard
   base.  Take one of the cardboard match sections, and leave the other one
   to make a second igniter.

4) Wrap the matches around the end of the fuse, with the heads of the matches
   touching the very end of the fuse.  Tape them there securely, making sure not
   to put tape over the match heads.  Make sure they are very secure by pulling
   on them at the base of the assembly.  They should not be able to move.

5) Wrap the cover of the matches around the matches attached to the fuse, making
   sure that the striker paper is below the match heads and the striker faces
   the match heads.  Tape the paper so that is fairly tight around the matches.
   Do not tape the cover of the striker to the fuse or to the matches.  Leave
   enough of the match book to pull on for ignition.

     The match book is wrapped around the matches, and is taped to itself.
     The matches are taped to the fuse.  The striker will rub against the
     matcheads when the match book is pulled.

6) When ready to use, simply pull on the match paper.  It should pull the
   striking paper across the match heads with enough friction to light them.
   In turn, the burning matcheads will light the fuse, since it adjacent to the
   burning match heads.



4.22     IMPACT IGNITION

     Impact ignition is an excellent method of ignition for spontaneous
terrorist activities.  The problem with an impact-detonating device is that it
must be kept in a very safe container so that it will not explode while being
transported to the place where it is to be used.  This can be done by having a
removable impact initiator.





     The best and most reliable impact initiator is one that uses factory
made initiators or primers. A no. 11 cap for black powder firearms is one such
primer. They usually come in boxes of 100, and cost about $2.50. To use such
a cap, however, one needs a nipple that it will fit on. Black powder nipples
are also available in gun stores. All that a person has to do is ask for a
package of nipples and the caps that fit them.  Nipples have a hole that goes
all the way through them, and they have a threaded end, and an end to put the
cap on. A cutaway of a nipple is shown below:

          |_______         |           |
               | |^^^^^^^^^|         |
               |_|                   |
                                   |
                  |________________|


     When making using this type of initiator, a hole must be drilled into
whatever container is used to make the bomb out of. The nipple is then screwed
into the hole so that it fits tightly. Then, the cap can be carried and placed
on the bomb when it is to be thrown. The cap should be bent a small amount
before it is placed on the nipple, to make sure that it stays in place.  The
only other problem involved with an impact detonating bomb is that it must
strike a hard surface on the nipple to set it off. By attaching fins or a small
parachute on the end of the bomb opposite the primer, the bomb, when thrown,
should strike the ground on the primer, and explode. Of course, a bomb with
mercury fulminate in each end will go off on impact regardless of which end it
strikes on, but mercury fulminate is also likely to go off if the person
carrying the bomb is bumped hard.

4.23     ELECTRICAL IGNITION

     Electrical ignition systems for detonation are usually the safest and
most reliable form of ignition. Electrical systems are ideal for demolition
work, if one doesn't have to worry so much about being caught. With two spools
of 500 ft of wire and a car battery, one can detonate explosives from a "safe",
comfortable distance, and be sure that there is nobody around that could get
hurt. With an electrical system, one can control exactly what time a device
will explode, within fractions of a second. Detonation can be aborted in  less
than a second's warning, if a person suddenly walks by the detonation sight, or
if a police car chooses to roll by at the time. The two best electrical igniters
are military squibs and model rocketry igniters. Blasting caps for construction
also work well. Model rocketry igniters are sold in packages of six, and cost
about $1.00 per pack. All that need be done to use them is connect it to two
wires and run a current through them. Military squibs are difficult to get,
but they are a little bit better, since they explode when a current is run
through them, whereas rocketry igniters only burst into flame. Military squibs
can be used to set off sensitive high explosives, such as R.D.X., or potassium
chlorate mixed with petroleum jelly. Igniters can be used to set off black
powder, mercury fulminate, or guncotton, which in turn, can set of a high order
explosive.





4.24     ELECTRO-MECHANICAL IGNITION

     Electro-mechanical ignition systems are systems that use some type of
mechanical switch to set off an explosive charge electrically.  This type of
switch is typically used in booby traps or other devices in which the person
who places the bomb does not wish to be anywhere near the device when it
explodes.  Several types of electro-mechanical detonators will be discussed


4.241     Mercury Switches

     Mercury switches are a switch that uses the fact that mercury metal
conducts electricity, as do all metals, but mercury metal is a liquid at
room temperatures. A typical mercury switch is a sealed glass tube with
two electrodes and a bead of mercury metal. It is sealed because of mercury's
nasty habit of giving off brain-damaging vapors. The diagram below may help
to explain a mercury switch.

                         ______________
                     A  /              \   B
      _____wire +______/___________     \
                       \   ( Hg )  |    /
                        \ _(_Hg_)__|___/
                                   |
                                   |
                            wire - |
                                   |
                                   |

     When the drop of mercury ("Hg" is mercury's atomic symbol) touches both
contacts, current flows through the switch.  If this particular switch was in
its present position, A---B, current would be flowing, since the mercury can
touch both contacts in the horizontal position.
     If, however, it was in the | position, the drop of mercury would only
touch the + contact on the A side. Current, then couldn't flow, since mercury
does not reach both contacts when the switch is in the vertical position.
     This type of switch is ideal to place by a door. If it were placed in
the path of a swinging door in the verticle position, the motion of the door
would knock the switch down, if it was held to the ground by a piece if tape.
This would tilt the switch into the verticle position, causing the mercury to
touch both contacts, allowing current to flow through the mercury, and to the
igniter or squib in an explosive device. Imagine opening a door and having it
slammed in your face by an explosion.


4.242     Tripwire Switches

     A tripwire is an element of the classic booby trap.  By placing a nearly
invisible line of string or fishing line in the probable path of a victim, and
by putting some type of trap there also, nasty things can be caused to occur.
If this mode of thought is applied to explosives, how would one use such a
tripwire to detonate a bomb.  The technique is simple.  By wrapping the tips of
a standard clothespin with aluminum foil, and placing something between them,
and connecting wires to each aluminum foil contact, an electric tripwire can
be made,  If a piece of wood attached to the tripwire was placed between the
contacts on the clothespin, the clothespin would serve as a switch.  When the
tripwire was pulled, the clothespin would snap together, allowing current to
flow between the two pieces of aluminum foil, thereby completing a circuit,
which would have the igniter or squib in it.  Current would flow between
the contacts to the igniter or squib, heat the igniter or squib, causing it
it to explode.

 contacts.


Make sure that the aluminum foil contacts do not touch the spring, since
the spring also conducts electricity.


4.243     Radio Control Detonators


     In the movies, every terrorist or criminal uses a radio controlled
detonator to set off explosives.  With a good radio detonator, one can be
several miles away from the device, and still control exactly when it explodes,
in much the same way as an electrical switch.  The problem with radio detonators
is that they are rather costly.  However, there could possibly be a reason that
a terrorist would wish to spend the amounts of money involved with a RC (radio
control) system and use it as a detonator.  If such an individual wanted to
devise an RC detonator, all he would need to do is visit the local hobby store
or toy store, and buy a radio controlled toy.  Taking it back to his/her abode,
all that he/she would have to do is detach the solenoid/motor that controls the
motion of the front wheels of a RC car, or detach the solenoid/motor of the
elevators/rudder of a RC plane, or the rudder of a RC boat, and re-connect the
squib or rocket engine igniter to the contacts for the solenoid/motor.  The
device should be tested several times with squibs or igniters, and fully
charged batteries should be in both he controller and the receiver (the part
that used to move parts before the device became a detonator).


4.3     DELAYS

     A delay is a device which causes time to pass from when a device is
set up to the time that it explodes.  A regular fuse is a delay, but it would
cost quite a bit to have a 24 hour delay with a fuse.  This section deals with
the different types of delays that can be employed by a terrorist who wishes to
be sure that his bomb will go off, but wants to be out of the country when it
does.


4.31     FUSE DELAYS

     It is extremely simple to delay explosive devices that employ fuses for
ignition.  Perhaps the simplest way to do so is with a cigarette.  An average
cigarette burns for about 8 minutes. The higher the "tar" and nicotine rating,
the slower the cigarette burns. Low "tar" and nicotine cigarettes burn quicker
than the higher "tar" and nicotine cigarettes, but they are also less likely to
go out if left unattended, i.e. not smoked. Depending on the wind or draft in
a given place, a high "tar" cigarette is better for delaying the ignition of
a fuse, but there must be enough wind or draft to give the cigarette enough
oxygen to burn. People who use cigarettes for the purpose of delaying fuses
will often test the cigarettes that they plan to use in advance to make sure
they stay lit and to see how long it will burn. Once a cigarettes burn rate
is determined, it is a simple matter of carefully putting a hole all the way
through a cigarette with a toothpick at the point desired, and pushing
the fuse for a device in the hole formed.

                            | |
                            | |
                            | |
                            | |
                            |_| ---------- light this end



     A similar type of device can be make from powdered charcoal and a sheet
of paper.  Simply roll the sheet of paper into a thin tube, and fill it with
powdered charcoal. Punch a hole in it at the desired location, and insert a
fuse. Both ends must be glued closed, and one end of the delay must be doused
with lighter fluid before it is lit. Or, a small charge of gunpowder mixed with
powdered charcoal could conceivably used for igniting such a delay. A chain of
charcoal briquettes can be used as a delay by merely lining up a few bricks
of charcoal so that they touch each other, end on end, and lighting the first
brick. Incense, which can be purchased at almost any novelty or party supply
store, can also be used as a fairly reliable delay. By wrapping the fuse
about the end of an incense stick, delays of up to 1/2 an hour are possible.
     Finally, it is possible to make a relatively slow-burning fuse in the
home. By dissolving about one teaspoon of black powder in about 1/4 a cup of
boiling water, and, while it is still hot, soaking in it a long piece of all
cotton string, a slow-burning fuse can be made. After the soaked string dries,
it must then be tied to the fuse of an explosive device. Sometimes, the
end of the slow burning fuse that meets the normal fuse has a charge of black
powder or gunpowder at the intersection point to insure ignition, since the
slow-burning fuse does not burn at a very high temperature. A similar type of
slow fuse can be made by taking the above mixture of boiling water and black
powder and pouring it on a long piece of toilet paper. The wet toilet paper
is then gently twisted up so that it resembles a firecracker fuse, and is
allowed to dry.



4.32     TIMER DELAYS


     Timer delays, or "time bombs" are usually employed by an individual who
wishes to threaten a place with a bomb and demand money to reveal its location
and means to disarm it.  Such a device could be placed in any populated place
if it were concealed properly.  There are several ways to build a timer delay.
By simply using a screw as one contact at the time that detonation is desired,
and using the hour hand of a clock as the other contact, a simple timer can be
made. The minute hand of a clock should be removed, unless a delay of less
than an hour is desired.

     This device is set to go off in eleven hours.  When the hour hand of the
clock reaches the contact near the numeral 5, it will complete the circuit,
allowing current to flow through the igniter or squib.

     The main disadvantage with this type of timer is that it can only be set
 for a maximum time of 12 hours.  If an electronic timer is used, such as that in
an electronic clock, then delays of up to 24 hours are possible.  By removing
the speaker from an electronic clock, and attaching the wires of a squib or
igniter to them, a timer with a delay of up to 24 hours can be made.  To utilize
this type of timer, one must have a socket that the clock can be plugged into.
All that one has to do is set the alarm time of the clock to the desired time,
connect the leads, and go away.  This could also be done with an electronic
watch, if a larger battery were used, and the current to the speaker of the
watch was stepped up via a transformer.  This would be good, since such a timer
could be extremely small.  The timer in a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) would
be ideal.  VCR's can usually be set for times of up to a week.  The leads from
the timer to the recording equipment would be the ones that an igniter or squib
would be connected to.  Also, one can buy timers from electronics stores that
would be ideal.  Finally, one could employ a digital watch, and use a relay, or
electro-magnetic switch to fire the igniter, and the current of the watch would
not have to be stepped up.


4.33     CHEMICAL DELAYS


     Chemical delays are uncommon, but they can be extremely effective in
some cases.  If a glass container is filled with concentrated sulfuric acid,
and capped with several thicknesses of aluminum foil, or a cap that it will eat
through, then it can be used as a delay.  Sulfuric acid will react with aluminum
foil to produce aluminum sulfate and hydrogen gas, and so the container must be
open to the air on one end so that the pressure of the hydrogen gas that is
forming does not break the container. See diagram on following page.










                _               _

               | |_____________| |

               | |  sulfuric   | |

               | |_____________| |           (several thicknesses)
               |_________________|


     The aluminum foil is placed over the bottom of the container and secured
there with tape.  When the acid eats through the aluminum foil, it can be used
to ignite an explosive device in several ways.

     1) Sulfuric acid is a good conductor of electricity.  If the acid that
        eats through the foil is collected in a glass container placed
        underneath the foil, and two wires are placed in the glass container,
         a current will be able to flow through the acid when both of the
        wires are immersed in the acid.

     2) Sulfuric acid reacts very violently with potassium chlorate.  If
        the acid drips down into a container containing potassium chlorate,
        the potassium chlorate will burst into flame.  This flame can be
        used to ignite a fuse, or the potassium chlorate can be the igniter
        for a thermit bomb, if some potassium chlorate is mixed in a 50/50
        ratio with the thermit, and this mixture is used as an igniter for
        the rest of the thermit.

     3) Sulfuric acid reacts with potassium permangenate in a similar way.



4.4     EXPLOSIVE CONTAINERS


     This section will cover everything from making a simple firecracker to
a complicated scheme for detonating an insensitive high explosive, both of which
are methods that could be utilized by perpetrators of terror.


4.41     PAPER CONTAINERS


     Paper was the first container ever used for explosives, since it was
first used by the Chinese to make fireworks. Paper containers are usually very
simple to make, and are certainly the cheapest. There are many possible uses
for paper in containing explosives, and the two most obvious are in firecrackers
and rocket engines. Simply by rolling up a long sheet of paper, and gluing it
together, one can make a simple rocket engine. Perhaps a more interesting and
dangerous use is in the firecracker. The firecracker shown here is one of
Mexican design. It is called a "polumna", meaning "dove". The process of their
manufacture is not unlike that of making a paper football. If one takes a sheet
of paper about 16 inches in length by 1.5 inches wide, and fold one corner so
that it looks like this:






       ________________________________________________________
       |                                                      |\
       |                                                      | \
       |                                                      |  \
       |______________________________________________________|___\

       and then fold it again so that it looks like this:

       _______________________________________________________
       |                                                     /|
       |                                                    / |
       |                                                   /  |
       |__________________________________________________/___|

      A pocket is formed.  This pocket can be filled with black powder, pyrodex,
flash powder, gunpowder,rocket engine powder, or any of the quick-burning fuel-
oxodizer mixtures that occur in the form of a fine powder.  A fuse is then
inserted, and one continues the triangular folds, being careful not to spill
out any of the explosive.  When the polumna is finished, it should be taped
together very tightly, since this will increase the strength of the container,
and produce a louder and more powerful explosion when it is lit.  The finished
polumna should look like a 1/4 inch - 1/3 inch thick triangle, like the one
shown below:


             ^
            / \  ----- securely tape all corners
           /   \

4.42     METAL CONTAINERS


     The classic pipe bomb is the best known example of a metal-contained
explosive.  Idiot anarchists take white tipped matches and cut off the match
heads.  They pound one end of a pipe closed with a hammer, pour in the white-
tipped matches, and then pound the other end closed.  This process often kills
the fool, since when he pounds the pipe closed, he could very easily cause
enough friction between the match heads to cause them to ignite and explode the
unfinished bomb.  By using pipe caps, the process is somewhat safer, and the
less stupid anarchist would never use white tipped matches in a bomb.  He would
buy two pipe caps and threaded pipe (fig. 1).  First, he would drill a hole in
one pipe cap, and put a fuse in it so that it will not come out, and so powder
will not escape during handling.  The fuse would be at least 3/4 an inch long
inside the bomb.  He would then screw the cap with the fuse in it on tightly,
possibly putting a drop of super glue on it to hold it tight.  He would then
pour his explosive powder in the bomb.  To pack it tightly, he would take a
large wad of tissue paper and, after filling the pipe to the very top, pack the
powder down, by using the paper as a ramrod tip, and pushing it with a pencil
or other wide ended object, until it would not move any further.  Finally, he
would screw the other pipe cap on, and glue it. The tissue paper would help
prevent some of the powder from being caught in the threads of the pipe or pipe
cap from being crushed and subject to friction, which might ignite the powder,
causing an explosion during manufacture. An assembled bomb is shown in fig. 2.

     This is one possible design that a mad bomber would use.  If, however,
he did not have access to threaded pipe with endcaps, he could always use a
piece of copper or aluminum pipe, since it is easily bent into a suitable
position.  A major problem with copper piping, however, is bending and folding
it without tearing it; if too much force is used when folding and bending copper
pipe, it will split along the fold.  The safest method for making a pipe bomb
out of copper or aluminum pipe is similar to the method with pipe and endcaps.
First, one flattens one end of a copper or aluminum pipe carefully, making sure
not to tear or rip the piping.  Then, the flat end of the pipe should be folded
over at least once, if this does not rip the pipe.  A fuse hole should be
drilled in the pipe near the now closed end, and the fuse should be inserted.
Next, the bomb-builder would fill the bomb with a low order explosive, and pack
it with a large wad of tissue paper.  He would then flatten and fold the other
end of the pipe with a pair of pliers.  If he was not too dumb, he would do this
slowly, since the process of folding and bending metal gives off heat, which
could set off the explosive.  A diagram is presented below:

      A CO2 cartridge from a B.B gun is another excellent container for
a low-order explosive.  It has one minor disadvantage: it is time consuming
to fill.  But this can be rectified by widening the opening of the cartridge
with a pointed tool.  Then, all that would have to be done is to fill the
CO2 cartridge with any low-order explosive, or any of the fast burning fuel-
oxodizer mixtures, and insert a fuse.  These devices are commonly called
"crater makers".

     A CO2 cartridge also works well as a container for a thermit incendiary
device, but it must be modified. The opening in the end must be widened, so
that the ignition mixture, such as powdered magnesium, does not explode. The
fuse will ignite the powdered magnesium, which, in turn, would ignite the
thermit.
     The previously mentioned designs for explosive devices are fine for
low-order explosives, but are unsuitable for high-order explosives, since the
latter requires a shockwave to be detonated. A design employing a smaller
low-order explosive device inside a larger device containing a high-order
explosive would probably be used. It would look something like:

     If the large high explosive container is small, such as a CO2 cartridge,
then a segment of a hollow radio antenna can be made into a low-order pipe bomb,
which can be fitted with a fuse, and inserted into the CO2 cartridge.

4.43     GLASS CONTAINERS


     Glass containers can be suitable for low-order explosives, but there
are problems with them.  First, a glass container can be broken relatively
easily compared to metal or plastic containers.  Secondly, in the
not-too-unlikely event of an "accident", the person making the device would
probably be seriously injured, even if the device was small.  A bomb made out of
a sample perfume bottle-sized container exploded in the hands of one boy, and he
still has pieces of glass in his hand.  He is also missing the final segment of
his ring finger, which was cut off by a sharp piece of flying glass...

     Nonetheless, glass containers such as perfume bottles can be used by
a demented individual, since such a device would not be detected by metal
detectors in an airport or other public place.  All that need be done is fill
the container, and drill a hole in the plastic cap that the fuse fits tightly
in, and screw the cap-fuse assembly on.

     Large explosive devices made from glass containers are not practicle,
since glass is not an exceptionally strong container.  Much of the explosive
that is used to fill the container is wasted if the container is much larger
than a 16 oz. soda bottle.  Also, glass containers are usually unsuitable for
high explosive devices, since a glass container would probably not withstand
the explosion of the initiator; it would shatter before the high explosive was
able to detonate.



4.44     PLASTIC CONTAINERS


     Plastic containers are perhaps the best containers for explosives, since
they can be any size or shape, and are not fragile like glass. Plastic piping
can be bought at hardware or plumbing stores, and a device much like the ones
used for metal containers can be made. The high-order version works well with
plastic piping. If the entire device is made out of plastic, it is not
detectable by metal detectors. Plastic containers can usually be shaped by
heating the container, and bending it at the appropriate place. They can be
glued closed with epoxy or other cement for plastics. Epoxy alone can be used
as an endcap, if a wad of tissue paper is placed in the piping. Epoxy with a
drying agent works best in this type of device.

     One end must be made first, and be allowed to dry completely before the
device can be filled with powder and fused.  Then, with another piece of tissue
paper, pack the powder tightly, and cover it with plenty of epoxy.  PVC pipe
works well for this type of device, but it cannot be used if the pipe had an
inside diameter greater than 3/4 of an inch.  Other plastic puttys can be used
int this type of device, but epoxy with a drying agent works best.




4.5     ADVANCED USES FOR EXPLOSIVES


     The techniques presented here are those that could be used by a person
who had some degree of knowledge of the use of explosives.  Some of this
information comes from demolitions books, or from military handbooks.  Advanced
uses for explosives usually involved shaped charges, or utilize a minimum amount
of explosive to do a maximum amount of damage.  They almost always involve high-
order explosives.


4.51     SHAPED CHARGES


     A shaped charge is an explosive device that, upon detonation, directs
the explosive force of detonation at a small target area. This process can be
used to breach the strongest armor, since forces of literally millions of pounds
of pressure per square inch can be generated. Shaped charges employ high-order
explosives, and usually electric ignition systems. KEEP IN MIND THAT ALL
EXPLOSIVES ARE DANGEROUS, AND SHOULD NEVER BE MADE OR USED!!





               An example of a shaped charge is shown below.

     If a device such as this is screwed to a safe, for example, it would
direct most of the explosive force at a point about 1 inch away from the opening
of the pipe. The basis for shaped charges is a cone-shaped opening in the
explosive material.  This cone should have an angle of 45 degrees.  A device
such as this one could also be attached to a metal surface with a powerful
electromagnet.










4.52     TUBE EXPLOSIVES


     A variation on shaped charges, tube explosives can be used in ways that
shaped charges cannot. If a piece of 1/2 inch plastic tubing was filled with
a sensitive high explosive like R.D.X., and prepared as the plastic explosive
container in section 4.44, a different sort of shaped charge could be produced;
a charge that directs explosive force in a circular manner. This type of
explosive could be wrapped around a column, or a doorknob, or a telephone pole.
The explosion would be directed in and out, and most likely destroy whatever
it was wrapped around. In an unbent state, a tube explosive would look like
this:

     When an assassin or terrorist wishes to use a tube bomb, he must wrap
it around whatever thing he wishes to destroy, and epoxy the ends of the tube
bomb together.  After it dries, he/she can connect wires to the squib wires,
and detonate the bomb, with any method of electric detonation.



4.53     ATOMIZED PARTICLE EXPLOSIONS


     If a highly flammable substance is atomized, or, divided into very small
particles, and large amounts of it is burned in a confined area, an explosion
similar to that occurring in the cylinder of an automobile is produced. The
tiny droplets of gasoline burn in the air, and the hot gasses expand rapidly,
pushing the cylinder up. Similarly, if a gallon of gasoline was atomized and
ignited in a building, it is very possible that the expanding gassed would push
the walls of the building down. This phenomenon is called an atomized particle
explosion. If a person can effectively atomize a large amount of a highly
flammable substance and ignite it, he could bring down a large building, bridge,
or other structure. Atomizing a large amount of gasoline, for example, can be
extremely difficult, unless one has the aid of a high explosive. If a gallon
jug of gasoline was placed directly over a high explosive charge, and the charge
was detonated, the gasoline would instantly be atomized and ignited. If this
occurred in a building, for example, an atomized particle explosion would surely
occur. Only a small amount of high explosive would be necessary to accomplish
this feat, about 1/2 a pound of T.N.T. or 1/4 a pound of R.D.X.  Also, instead
of gasoline, powdered aluminum could be used. It is necessary that a high
explosive be used to atomize a flammable material, since a low-order explosion
does not occur quickly enough to atomize or ignite the flammable material.




4.54     LIGHTBULB BOMBS



     An automatic reaction to walking into a dark room is to turn on the
light.  This can be fatal, if a lightbulb bomb has been placed in the overhead
light socket.  A lightbulb bomb is surprisingly easy to make.  It also comes
with its own initiator and electric ignition system.  On some lightbulbs, the
lightbulb glass can be removed from the metal base by heating the base of a
lightbulb in a gas flame, such as that of a blowtorch or gas stove.  This must
be done carefully, since the inside of a lightbulb is a vacuum.  When the glue
gets hot enough, the glass bulb can be pulled off the metal base.  On other
bulbs, it is necessary to heat the glass directly with a blowtorch or
oxy-acetylene torch.  When the bulb is red hot, a hole must be carefully poked
in the bulb, remembering the vacuum state inside the bulb.  In either case,
once the bulb and/or base has cooled down to room temperature or lower, the
bulb can be filled with an explosive material, such as black powder.  If the
glass was removed from the metal base, it must be glued back on to the base
with epoxy.  If a hole was put in the bulb, a piece of duct tape is sufficient
to hold the explosive in the in the bulb.  Then, after making sure that the
socket has no power by checking with a working lightbulb, all that need be
done is to screw the lightbulb bomb into the socket.  Such a device has been
used by terrorists or assassins with much success, since nobody can search the
room for a bomb without first turning on the light.









4.55     BOOK BOMBS


     Concealing a bomb can be extremely difficult in a day and age where
perpetrators of violence run wild.  Bags and briefcases are often searched
by authorities whenever one enters a place where an individual might intend
to set off a bomb.  One approach to disguising a bomb is to build what is
called a book bomb; an explosive device that is entirely contained inside of
a book.  Usually, a relatively large book is required, and the book must be of
the hardback variety to hide any protrusions of a bomb.  Dictionaries, law
books, large textbooks, and other such books work well.  When an individual
makes a bookbomb, he/she must choose a type of book that is appropriate for
the place where the book bomb will be placed.  The actual construction of a
book bomb can be done by anyone who possesses an electric drill and a coping
saw.  First, all of the pages of the book must be glued together.  By pouring
an entire container of water-soluble glue into a large bucket, and filling
the bucket with boiling water, a glue-water solution can be made that will
hold all of the book's pages together tightly.  After the glue-water solution
has cooled to a bearable temperature, and the solution has been stirred well,
the pages of the book must be immersed in the glue-water solution, and each
page must be thoroughly soaked.  It is extremely important that the covers of
the book do not get stuck to the pages of the book while the pages are drying.
Suspending the book by both covers and clamping the pages together in a vice
works best.  When the pages dry, after about three days to a week, a hole must
be drilled into the now rigid pages, and they should drill out much like wood.
Then, by inserting the coping saw blade through the pages and sawing out a
rectangle from the middle of the book, the individual will be left with a shell
of the book's pages.  The pages, when drilled out, should look like this:


               ________________________

               |______________________|

                 (book covers omitted)


     This rectangle must be securely glued to the back cover of the book.
After building his/her bomb, which usually is of the timer or radio controlled
variety, the bomber places it inside the book.  The bomb itself, and whatever
timer or detonator is used, should be packed in foam to prevent it from rolling
or shifting about.  Finally, after the timer is set, or the radio control has
been turned on, the front cover is glued closed, and the bomb is taken to its
destination.










4.56     PHONE BOMBS


     The phone bomb is an explosive device that has been used in the past
to kill or injure a specific individual.  The basic idea is simple: when the
person answers the phone, the bomb explodes.  If a small but powerful high
explosive device with a squib was placed in the phone receiver, when the
current flowed through the receiver, the squib would explode, detonating the
high explosive in the person's hand.  Nasty.  All that has to be done is
acquire a squib, and tape the receiver switch down. Unscrew the mouthpiece
cover, and remove the speaker, and connect the squib's leads where it was.
Place a high explosive putty, such as C-1 (see section 3.31) in the receiver,
and screw the cover on, making sure that the squib is surrounded by the C-1.
Hang the phone up, and leave the tape in place.  When the individual to whom
the phone belongs attempts to answer the phone, he will notice the tape, and
remove it.  This will allow current to flow through the squib.  Note that
the device will not explode by merely making a phone call; the owner of the
phone must lift up the receiver, and remove the tape.  It is highly probable
that the phone will be by his/her ear when the device explodes...


5.0     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR PROJECTILE WEAPONS


     Explosive and/or poisoned ammunition is an important part of a social
deviant's arsenal.  Such ammunition gives the user a distinct advantage over
individual who use normal ammunition, since a grazing hit is good enough to
kill.  Special ammunition can be made for many types of weapons, from crossbows
to shotguns.


5.1     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR PRIMITIVE WEAPONS


     For the purposes of this publication, we will call any weapon primitive
that does not employ burning gunpowder to propel a projectile forward.  This
means blowguns, bows and crossbows, and wristrockets.



5.11     BOW AND CROSSBOW AMMUNITION


     Bows and crossbows both fire arrows or bolts as ammunition.  It is
extremely simple to poison an arrow or bolt, but it is a more difficult matter
to produce explosive arrows or bolts.  If, however, one can acquire aluminum
piping that is the same diameter of an arrow or crossbow bolt, the entire
segment of piping can be converted into an explosive device that detonates
upon impact, or with a fuse.  All that need be done is find an aluminum tube
of the right length and diameter, and plug the back end with tissue paper and
epoxy.  Fill the tube with any type of low-order explosive or sensitive high-
order explosive up to about 1/2 an inch from the top.  Cut a slot in the piece
of tubing, and carefully squeeze the top of the tube into a round point, making
sure to leave a small hole.  Place a no. 11 percussion cap over the hole, and
secure it with super glue.  Finally, wrap the end of the device with electrical
or duct tape, and make fins out of tape.  Or, fins can be bought at a sporting
goods store, and glued to the shaft.  The finished product should look like:

     tp: tissue paper

     epy: epoxy

     When the arrow or bolt strikes a hard surface, the percussion cap
explodes, igniting or detonating the explosive.


5.12     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR BLOWGUNS


     The blowgun is an interesting weapon which has several advantages.
A blowgun can be extremely accurate, concealable, and deliver an explosive
or poisoned projectile.  The manufacture of an explosive dart or projectile
is not difficult.  Perhaps the most simple design for such involves the use
of a pill capsule, such as the kind that are taken for headaches or allergies.
Such a capsule could easily be opened, and the medicine removed.  Next, the
capsule would be re-filled with an impact-sensitive explosive.  An additional
high explosive charge could be placed behind the impact-sensitive explosive,
if one of the larger capsules were used.  Finally, the explosive capsule would
be reglued back together, and a tassel or cotton would be glued to the end
containing the high explosive, to insure that the impact-detonating explosive
struck the target first.  Such a device would probably be about 3/4 of an inch
long, not including the tassel or cotton, and look something like this:





                 ____________________

                \________|___________/-----------------------




5.13     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR WRISTROCKETS AND SLINGSHOTS


     A modern wristrocket is a formidable weapon.  It can throw a shooter
marble about 500 ft. with reasonable accuracy.  Inside of 200 ft., it could well
be lethal to a man or animal, if it struck in a vital area.  Because of the
relatively large sized projectile that can be used in a wristrocket, the
wristrocket can be adapted to throw relatively powerful explosive projectiles.
A small segment of aluminum pipe could be made into an impact-detonating device
by filling it with an impact-sensitive explosive material.  Also, such a pipe
could be filled with a low-order explosive, and fitted with a fuse, which would
be lit before the device was shot.  One would have to make sure that the fuse
was of sufficient length to insure that the device did not explode before it
reached its intended target.  Finally, .22 caliber caps, such as the kind that
are used in .22 caliber blank guns, make excellent exploding ammunition for
wristrockets, but they must be used at a relatively close range, because of
their light weight.




5.2     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR FIREARMS


     When special ammunition is used in combination with the power and
rapidity of modern firearms, it becomes very easy to take on a small army with
a single weapon. It is possible to buy explosive ammunition, but that can be
difficult to do. Such ammunition can also be manufactured in the home.  There
is, however, a risk involved with modifying any ammunition.  If the ammunition
is modified incorrectly, in such a way that it makes the bullet even the
slightest bit wider, an explosion in the barrel of the weapon will occur.  For
this reason, NOBODY SHOULD EVER ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE SUCH AMMUNITION.


5.21     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR HANDGUNS


     If an individual wished to produce explosive ammunition for his/her
handgun, he/she could do it, provided that the person had an impact-sensitive
explosive and a few simple tools.  One would first purchase all lead bullets,
and then make or acquire an impact-detonating explosive.  By drilling a hole
in a lead bullet with a drill, a space could be created for the placement of
an explosive.  After filling the hole with an explosive, it would be sealed
in the bullet with a drop of hot wax from a candle.  A diagram of a completed
exploding bullet is shown below.

                      _o_ ------------ drop of wax
                     /|*|\

                    |_____|

     This hollow space design also works for putting poison in bullets.





5.22     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR SHOTGUNS

     Because of their large bore and high power, it is possible to create
some extremely powerful special ammunition for use in shotguns. If a shotgun
shell is opened at the top, and the shot removed, the shell can be re-closed.
Then, if one can find a very smooth, lightweight wooden dowel that is close to
the bore width of the shotgun, a person can make several types of shotgun-
launched weapons. Insert the dowel in the barrel of the shotgun with the
shell without the shot in the firing chamber. Mark the dowel about six inches
away from the end of the barrel, and remove it from the barrel. Next, decide
what type of explosive or incendiary device is to be used. This device can be a
chemical fire bottle (sect. 3.43), a pipe bomb (sect 4.42), or a thermit bomb
(sect 3.41 and 4.42). After the device is made, it must be securely attached to
the dowel. When this is done, place the dowel back in the shotgun. The bomb or
incendiary device should be on the end of the dowel. Make sure that the device
has a long enough fuse, light the fuse, and fire the shotgun. If the projectile
is not too heavy, ranges of up to 300 ft are possible. A diagram of a shotgun
projectile is shown below:

5.3     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR COMPRESSED AIR/GAS WEAPONS


     This section deals with the manufacture of special ammunition for
compressed air or compressed gas weapons, such as pump B.B guns, CO2 B.B guns,
and .22 cal pellet guns.  These weapons, although usually thought of as kids
toys, can be made into rather dangerous weapons.














5.31     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR B.B GUNS


     A B.B gun, for this manuscript, will be considered any type of rifle or
pistol that uses compressed air or CO2 gas to fire a projectile with a caliber
of .177, either B.B, or lead pellet. Such guns can have almost as high a muzzle
velocity as a bullet-firing rifle. Because of the speed at which a .177 caliber
projectile flies, an impact detonating projectile can easily be made that has a
caliber of .177. Most ammunition for guns of greater than .22 caliber use
primers to ignite the powder in the bullet. These primers can be bought at gun
stores, since many people like to reload their own bullets. Such primers
detonate when struck by the firing pin of a gun. They will also detonate if
they are thrown at a hard surface at a great speed. Usually, they will also fit
in the barrel of a .177 caliber gun. If they are inserted flat end first, they
will detonate when the gun is fired at a hard surface. If such a primer is
attached to a piece of thin metal tubing, such as that used in an antenna, the
tube can be filled with an explosive, be sealed, and fired from a B.B gun. A
diagram of such a projectile appears below:

                    |_______ antenna tubing

     The front primer is attached to the tubing with a drop of super glue.
The tubing is then filled with an explosive, and the rear primer is glued on.
Finally, a tassel, or a small piece of cotton is glued to the rear primer, to
insure that the projectile strikes on the front primer.  The entire projectile
should be about 3/4 of an inch long.



5.32     SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR .22 CALIBER PELLET GUNS


     A .22 caliber pellet gun usually is equivalent to a .22 cal rifle, at
close ranges.  Because of this, relatively large explosive projectiles can be
adapted for use with .22 caliber air rifles.  A design similar to that used in
section 5.12 is suitable, since some capsules are about .22 caliber or smaller.
Or, a design similar to that in section 5.31 could be used, only one would have
to purchase black powder percussion caps, instead of ammunition primers, since
there are percussion caps that are about .22 caliber.  A #11 cap is too small,
but anything larger will do nicely.












6.0     ROCKETS AND CANNONS


     Rockets and cannon are generally thought of as heavy artillery.
Perpetrators of violence do not usually employ such devices, because they are
difficult or impossible to acquire.  They are not, however, impossible to make.
Any individual who can make or buy black powder or pyrodex can make such things.
A terrorist with a cannon or large rocket is, indeed, something to fear.



6.1     ROCKETS


     Rockets were first developed by the Chinese several hundred years
before Christ.  They were used for entertainment, in the form of fireworks.
They were not usually used for military purposes because they were inaccurate,
expensive, and unpredictable.  In modern times, however, rockets are used
constantly by the military, since they are cheap, reliable, and have no recoil.
Perpetrators of violence, fortunately, cannot obtain military rockets, but they
can make or buy rocket engines.  Model rocketry is a popular hobby of the space
age, and to launch a rocket, an engine is required.  Estes, a subsidiary of
Damon, is the leading manufacturer of model rockets and rocket engines.  Their
most powerful engine, the "D" engine, can develop almost 12 lbs. of thrust;
enough to send a relatively large explosive charge a significant distance.
Other companies, such as Centuri, produce even larger rocket engines, which
develop up to 30 lbs. of thrust.  These model rocket engines are quite reliable,
and are designed to be fired electrically.  Most model rocket engines have
three basic sections.  The diagram below will help explain them.

                                              casing


     The clay nozzle is where the igniter is inserted.  When the area labeled
"thrust" is ignited, the "thrust" material, usually a large single grain of a
propellant such as black powder or pyrodex, burns, forcing large volumes of hot,
rapidly expanding gasses out the narrow nozzle, pushing the rocket forward.
After the material has been consumed, the smoke section of the engine is
ignited.  It is usually a slow-burning material, similar to black powder that
has had various compounds added to it to produce visible smoke, usually black,
white, or yellow in color.  This section exists so that the rocket will be seen
when it reaches its maximum altitude, or apogee.  When it is burned up, it
ignites the ejection charge, labeled "eject".  The ejection charge is finely
powdered black powder.  It burns very rapidly, exploding, in effect.  The
explosion of the ejection charge pushes out the parachute of the model rocket.
It could also be used to ignite the fuse of a bomb...











     Rocket engines have their own peculiar labeling system.  Typical engine
labels are: 1/4A-2T, 1/2A-3T, A8-3, B6-4, C6-7, and D12-5.  The letter is an
indicator of the power of an engine.  "B" engines are twice as powerful as "A"
engines, and "C" engines are twice as powerful as "B" engines, and so on.  The
number following the letter is the approximate thrust of the engine, in pounds.
the final number and letter is the time delay, from the time that the thrust
period of engine burn ends until the ejection charge fires; "3T" indicates a
3 second delay.


NOTE: an extremely effective rocket propellant can be made by mixing aluminum
      dust with ammonium perchlorate and a very small amount of iron oxide.
      The mixture is bound together by an epoxy.



6.11     BASIC ROCKET BOMB


     A rocket bomb is simply what the name implies: a bomb that is delivered
to its target by means of a rocket.  Most people who would make such a device
would use a model rocket engine to power the device.  By cutting fins from balsa
wood and gluing them to a large rocket engine, such as the Estes "C" engine, a
basic rocket could be constructed.  Then, by attaching a "crater maker", or CO2
cartridge bomb to the rocket, a bomb would be added.  To insure that the fuse of
the "crater maker" (see sect. 4.42) ignited, the clay over the ejection charge
of the engine should be scraped off with a plastic tool.  The fuse of the bomb
should be touching the ejection charge, as shown below.

     Duct tape is the best way to attach the crater maker to the rocket
engine.  Note in the diagram the absence of the clay over the ejection charge
Many different types of explosive payloads can be attached to the rocket, such
as a high explosive, an incendiary device, or a chemical fire bottle.



   Either four or three fins must be glued to the rocket engine to insure that
the rocket flies straight. The fins should look like the following diagram:

          |       |
           \_____/


     The leading edge and trailing edge should be sanded with sandpaper so
that they are rounded.  This will help make the rocket fly straight.  A two
inch long section of a plastic straw can be attached to the rocket to launch it
from.  A clothes hanger can be cut and made into a launch rod.  The segment of
a plastic straw should be glued to the rocket engine adjacent to one of the fins
of the rocket.  A front view of a completed rocket bomb is shown below.

     By cutting a coat hanger at the indicated arrows, and bending it, a
launch rod can be made.  After a fuse is inserted in the engine, the rocket is
simply slid down the launch rod, which is put through the segment of plastic
straw. The rocket should slide easily along a coathanger, such as the one
illustated on the following page:

6.12     LONG RANGE ROCKET BOMB


     Long range rockets can be made by using multi-stage rockets.  Model
rocket engines with an "0" for a time delay are designed for use in multi-
stage rockets.  An engine such as the D12-0 is an excellent example of such an
engine.  Immediately after the thrust period is over, the ejection charge
explodes.  If another engine is placed directly against the back of an "0"
engine, the explosion of the ejection charge will send hot gasses and burning
particles into the nozzle of the engine above it, and ignite the thrust section.
 This will push the used "0" engine off of the rocket, causing an overall loss of
weight.  The main advantage of a multi-stage rocket is that it loses weight as
travels, and it gains velocity.  A multi-stage rocket must be designed somewhat
differently than a single stage rocket, since, in order for a rocket to fly
straight, its center of gravity must be ahead of its center of drag.  This is
accomplished by adding weight to the front of the rocket, or by moving the
center of drag back by putting fins on the rocket that are well behind the
rocket.  A diagram of a multi-stage rocket appears on the following page:

     The fuse is put in the bottom engine.


     Two, three, or even four stages can be added to a rocket bomb to give it
a longer range.  It is important, however, that for each additional stage, the
fin area gets larger.



6.13     MULTIPLE WARHEAD ROCKET BOMBS


     "M.R.V." is an acronym for Multiple Reentry Vehicle.  The concept is
simple: put more than one explosive warhead on a single missile.  This can be
done without too much difficulty by anyone who knows how to make crater-makers
and can buy rocket engines.  By attaching crater makers with long fuses to a
rocket, it is possible that a single rocket could deliver several explosive
devices to a target. Such a rocket might look like the diagram on the
following page:

     The crater makers are attached to the tube of rolled paper with tape.
the paper tube is made by rolling and gluing a 4 inch by 8 inch piece of paper.
The tube is glued to the engine, and is filled with gunpowder or black powder.
Small holes are punched in it, and the fuses of the crater makers are inserted
in these holes.  A crater maker is glued to the open end of the tube, so that
its fuse is inside the tube.  A fuse is inserted in the engine, or in the bottom
engine if the rocket bomb is multi stage, and the rocket is launched from the
coathanger launcher, if a segment of a plastic straw has been attached to it.



6.2     CANNON


     The cannon is a piece of artillery that has been in use since the
11th century.  It is not unlike a musket, in that it is filled with powder,
loaded, and fired.  Cannons of this sort must also be cleaned after each shot,
otherwise, the projectile may jam in the barrel when it is fired, causing the
barrel to explode.  A sociopath could build a cannon without too much trouble,
if he/she had a little bit of money, and some patience.
















6.21     BASIC PIPE CANNON


     A simple cannon can be made from a thick pipe by almost anyone.  The
only difficult part is finding a pipe that is extremely smooth on its interior.
This is absolutely necessary; otherwise, the projectile may jam.  Copper or
aluminum piping is usually smooth enough, but it must also be extremely thick to
withstand the pressure developed by the expanding hot gasses in a cannon.  If
one uses a projectile such as a CO2 cartridge, since such a projectile can be
made to explode, a pipe that is about 1.5 - 2 feet long is ideal.  Such a pipe
MUST have walls that are at least 1/3 to 1/2 an inch thick, and be very smooth
on the interior.  If possible, screw an endplug into the pipe.  Otherwise, the
pipe must be crimped and folded closed, without cracking or tearing the pipe.
A small hole is drilled in the back of the pipe near the crimp or endplug.
Then, all that need be done is fill the pipe with about two teaspoons of
grade blackpowder or pyrodex, insert a fuse, pack it lightly by ramming a wad
of tissue paper down the barrel, and drop in a CO2 cartridge.  Brace the cannon
securely against a strong structure, light the fuse, and run.  If the person is
lucky, he will not have overcharged the cannon, and he will not be hit by
pieces of exploding barrel.  Such a cannon would look like this:

             __________________ fuse hole

     |_|______________________________________________________________|


     An exploding projectile can be made for this type of cannon with a CO2
cartridge. It is relatively simple to do. Just make a crater maker, and
construct it such that the fuse projects about an inch from the end of the
cartridge. Then, wrap the fuse with duct tape, covering it entirely, except for
a small amount at the end. Put this in the pipe cannon without using a tissue
paper packing wad. When the cannon is fired, it will ignite the end of the fuse,
and shoot the CO2 cartridge. The explosive-filled cartridge will explode in
about three seconds, if all goes well. Such a projectile would look like this:

6.22     ROCKET FIRING CANNON


     A rocket firing cannon can be made exactly like a normal cannon; the
only difference is the ammunition. A rocket fired from a cannon will fly
further than a rocket alone, since the action of shooting it overcomes the
initial inertia. A rocket that is launched when it is moving will go further
than one that is launched when it is stationary. Such a rocket would resemble
a normal rocket bomb, except it would have no fins. It would look like this:


           ___
          /   \
          |   |
          | C |

          | I |
          | N |
          | E |
          |___|


     the fuse on such a device would, obviously, be short, but it would not
be ignited until the rocket's ejection charge exploded.  Thus, the delay before
the ejection charge, in effect, becomes the delay before the bomb explodes.
Note that no fuse need be put in the rocket; the burning powder in the cannon
will ignite it, and simultaneously push the rocket out of the cannon at a high
velocity.



7.0     PYROTECHNICA ERRATA


     There are many other types of pyrotechnics that a perpetrator of
violence might employ. Smoke bombs can be purchased in magic stores, and large
military smoke bombs can be bought through adds in gun and military magazines.
Also, fireworks can also be used as weapons of terror. A large aerial display
rocket would cause many injuries if it were to be fired so that it landed on the
ground near a crowd of people. Even the "harmless" pull-string fireworks, which
consists of a sort of firecracker that explodes when the strings running
through it are pulled, could be placed inside a large charge of a sensitive
high explosive. Tear gas is another material that might well be useful
to the sociopath, and such a material could be instantly disseminated over
a large crowd by means of a rocket-bomb, with nasty effects.















7.1     SMOKE BOMBS


     One type of pyrotechnic device that might be employed by a terrorist in
many way would be a smoke bomb.  Such a device could conceal the getaway route,
or cause a diversion, or simply provide cover.  Such a device, were it to
produce enough smoke that smelled bad enough, could force the evacuation of a
building, for example.  Smoke bombs are not difficult to make.  Although the
military smoke bombs employ powdered white phosphorus or titanium compounds,
such materials are usually unavailable to even the most well-equipped terrorist.
Instead, he/she would have to make the smoke bomb for themselves.

     Most homemade smoke bombs usually employ some type of base powder, such
as black powder or pyrodex, to support combustion.  The base material will burn
well, and provide heat to cause the other materials in the device to burn, but
not completely or cleanly.  Table sugar, mixed with sulfur and a base material,
produces large amounts of smoke.  Sawdust, especially if it has a small amount
of oil in it, and a base powder works well also.  Other excellent smoke
ingredients are small pieces of rubber, finely ground plastics, and many
chemical mixtures.  The material in road flares can be mixed with sugar and
sulfur and a base powder produces much smoke.  Most of the fuel-oxodizer
mixtures, if the ratio is not correct, produce much smoke when added to a base
powder.  The list of possibilities goes on and on.  The trick to a successful
smoke bomb also lies in the container used.  A plastic cylinder works well, and
contributes to the smoke produced.  The hole in the smoke bomb where the fuse
enters must be large enough to allow the material to burn without causing an
explosion.  This is another plus for plastic containers, since they will melt
and burn when the smoke material ignites, producing an opening large enough to
prevent an explosion.


7.2     COLORED FLAMES

     Colored flames can often be used as a signaling device for terrorists.
by putting a ball of colored flame material in a rocket; the rocket, when the
ejection charge fires, will send out a burning colored ball.  The materials that

7.3     TEAR GAS

     A terrorist who could make tear gas or some similar compound could use
it with ease against a large number of people.  Tear gas is fairly complicated
to make, however, and this prevents such individuals from being able to utilize
its great potential for harm.  One method for its preparation is shown below.

     EQUIPMENT
     _________

     1.  ring stands (2)
     2.  alcohol burner
     3.  erlenmeyer flask, 300 ml
     4.  clamps (2)
     5.  rubber stopper
     6.  glass tubing
     7.  clamp holder
     8.  condenser
     9.  rubber tubing
     10.  collecting flask
     11.  air trap
     12.  beaker, 300 ml


     MATERIALS
     _________

     10 gms  glycerine

     2 gms sodium bisulfate

     distilled water


1.)  In an open area, wearing a gas mask, mix 10 gms of glycerine with 2 gms
     of sodium bisulfate in the 300 ml erlenmeyer flask.

2.)  Light the alcohol burner, and gently heat the flask.

3.)  The mixture will begin to bubble and froth; these bubbles are tear gas.

4.)  When the mixture being heated ceases to froth and generate gas, or a brown
     residue becomes visible in the tube, the reaction is complete.  Remove the
     heat source, and dispose of the heated mixture, as it is corrosive.

5.)  The material that condenses in the condenser and drips into the collecting
     flask is tear gas.  It must be capped tightly, and stored in a safe place.


7.4     FIREWORKS


     While fireworks cannot really be used as an effective means of terror,
they do have some value as distractions or incendiaries.  There are several
basic types of fireworks that can be made in the home, whether for fun, profit,
or nasty uses.










7.41     FIRECRACKERS


     A simple firecracker can be made from cardboard tubing and epoxy.
The instructions are below:

     1) Cut a small piece of cardboard tubing from the tube you are using.
        "Small" means anything less than 4 times the diameter of the tube.

     2) Set the section of tubing down on a piece of wax paper, and fill
        it with epoxy and the drying agent to a height of 3/4 the diameter
        of the tubing.  Allow the epoxy to dry to maximum hardness, as
        specified on the package.

     3) When it is dry, put a small hole in the middle of the tube, and
        insert a desired length of fuse.

     4) Fill the tube with any type of flame-sensitive explosive.  Flash
        powder, pyrodex, black powder, potassium picrate, lead azide,
        nitrocellulose, or any of the fast burning fuel-oxodizer mixtures
        will do nicely.  Fill the tube almost to the top.

     5) Pack the explosive tightly in the tube with a wad of tissue paper
        and a pencil or other suitable ramrod.  Be sure to leave enough space
         for more epoxy.

     6) Fill the remainder of the tube with the epoxy and hardener, and allow
         it to dry.

     7) For those who wish to make spectacular firecrackers, always use
        flash powder, mixed with a small amount of other material for
        colors.  By crushing the material on a sparkler, and adding it
        to the flash powder, the explosion will be the same color as the
        sparkler.   By adding small chunks of sparkler material, the
        device will throw out colored burning sparks, of the same color
        as the sparkler.  By adding powdered iron, orange sparks will
        be produced.  White sparks can be produced from magnesium shavings,
        or from small, LIGHTLY crumpled balls of aluminum foil.

        Example:  Suppose I wish to make a firecracker that will explode
               with a red flash, and throw out white sparks.  First,
               I would take a road flare, and finely powder the material
               inside it.   Or, I could take a red sparkler, and finely
               powder it.  Then, I would mix a small amount of this
               material with the flash powder.  (NOTE: FLASH POWDER
               MAY REACT WITH SOME MATERIALS THAT IT IS MIXED WITH, AND
               EXPLODE SPONTANEOUSLY!)  I would mix it in a ratio of
               9 parts flash powder to 1 part of flare or sparkler
               material, and add about 15 small balls of aluminum foil
               I would store the material in a plastic bag overnight
               outside of the house, to make sure that the stuff doesn't
               react.  Then, in the morning, I would test a small amount
               of it, and if it was satisfactory, I would put it in the
               firecracker.

     8) If this type of firecracker is mounted on a rocket engine,
        professional to semi-professional displays can be produced.









7.42     SKYROCKETS


     An impressive home made skyrocket can easily be made in the home from
model rocket engines.  Estes engines are recommended.

     1) Buy an Estes Model Rocket Engine of the desired size, remembering
        that the power doubles with each letter.  (See sect. 6.1 for details)

     2) Either buy a section of body tube for model rockets that exactly
        fits the engine, or make a tube from several thicknesses of paper
        and glue.

     3) Scrape out the clay backing on the back of the engine, so that
        the powder is exposed.  Glue the tube to the engine, so that the
        tube covers at least half the engine.  Pour a small charge of
        flash powder in the tube, about 1/2 an inch.

     4) By adding materials as detailed in the section on firecrackers,
        various types of effects can be produced.

     5) By putting Jumping Jacks or bottle rockets without the stick
        in the tube, spectacular displays with moving fireballs or
           M.R.V.'s can be produced.

     6) Finally, by mounting many home made firecrackers on the tube with
        the fuses in the tube, multiple colored bursts can be made.


7.43     ROMAN CANDLES

     Roman candles are impressive to watch.  They are relatively difficult
to make, compared to the other types of home-made fireworks, but they are
well worth the trouble.

     1) Buy a 1/2 inch thick model rocket body tube, and reinforce it
        with several layers of paper and/or masking tape.  This must
        be done to prevent the tube from exploding.  Cut the tube into
        about 10 inch lengths.

     2) Put the tube on a sheet of wax paper, and seal one end with epoxy
        and the drying agent.  About 1/2 of an inch is sufficient.

     3) Put a hole in the tube just above the bottom layer of epoxy,
        and insert a desired length of water proof fuse.  Make sure that
        the fuse fits tightly.

     4) Pour about 1 inch of pyrodex or gunpowder down the open end of the
        tube.

     5) Make a ball by powdering about two 6 inch sparklers of the desired
        color.  Mix this powder with a small amount of flash powder and
        a small amount of pyrodex, to have a final ratio (by volume) of
        60% sparkler material / 20% flash powder / 20% pyrodex.  After
        mixing the powders well, add water, one drop at a time, and mixing
        continuously, until a damp paste is formed.  This paste should
        be moldable by hand, and should retain its shape when left alone.
        Make a ball out of the paste that just fits into the tube.  Allow
        the ball to dry.







     6) When it is dry, drop the ball down the tube.  It should slide down
        fairly easily.  Put a small wad of tissue paper in the tube, and pack
         it gently against the ball with a pencil.

     7) When ready to use, put the candle in a hole in the ground, pointed
        in a safe direction, light the fuse, and run.  If the device works,
        a colored fireball should shoot out of the tube to a height of
        about 30 feet.  This height can be increased by adding a slightly
        larger powder charge in step 4, or by using a slightly longer tube.

     8) If the ball does not ignite, add slightly more pyrodex in step 5.

     9) The balls made for roman candles also function very well in rockets,
        producing an effect of falling colored fireballs.

9.0     CHECKLIST FOR RAIDS ON LABS

     In the end, the serious terrorist would probably realize that if he/she
wishes to make a truly useful explosive, he or she will have to steal the
chemicals to make the explosive from a lab.  A list of such chemicals in order
of priority would probably resemble the following:

     LIQUIDS                    SOLIDS
     _______                    ______

     ____     Nitric Acid        ____     Potassium Perchlorate
     ____     Sulfuric Acid      ____     Potassium Chlorate
     ____     95% Ethanol        ____     Picric Acid (usually a powder)
     ____     Toluene            ____     Ammonium Nitrate
     ____     Perchloric Acid    ____     Powdered Magnesium
     ____     Hydrochloric Acid  ____     Powdered Aluminum

10.0     USEFUL PYROCHEMISTRY

     In general, it is possible to make many chemicals from just a few basic
ones.  A list of useful chemical reactions is presented.  It assumes knowledge
of general chemistry; any individual who does not understand the following
reactions would merely have to read the first five chapters of a high school
chemistry book.


1.  potassium perchlorate from perchloric acid and potassium hydroxide
     K(OH)       +     HClO     ---->     KClO     +    H O
                   4              4           2

2.  potassium nitrate from nitric acid and potassium hydroxide
      "       +     HNO     ---->     KNO     +     "
                  3             3

3.  ammonium perchlorate from perchloric acid and ammonium hydroxide
     NH OH       +     HClO     ---->     NH ClO     +     "
       3              4                 3   4

4.  ammonium nitrate from nitric acid and ammonium hydroxide
        NH OH       +     HNO     ---->     NH NO     +     "
       3             3                      3  3

5.  powdered aluminum from acids, aluminum foil, and magnesium

A.     aluminum foil    +    6HCl    ---->   2AlCl   +   3H
                                                3            2

B.     2AlCl  (aq)   +    3Mg    ---->  3MgCl (aq)   +  2Al
          3                                  2






     The Al will be a very fine silvery powder at the bottom of the container
which must be filtered and dried.   This same method works with nitric and
sulfuric acids, but these acids are too valuable in the production of high
explosives to use for such a purpose, unless they are available in great excess.


11.0     ABOUT THE AUTHOR


     The author, who wishes his name to be unknown, is presently attending
a college in the United States of America, majoring in Engineering.  He was
raised by his parents on the East Coast, and received his high school education
there.  He first became interested in pyrotechnics when he was about eight years
of age.  At age twelve, he produced his first explosive device; it was slightly
more powerful than a large firecracker.  He continued to produce explosive
devices for several years.  He also became interested in model rocketry, and has
built several rockets from kits, and designed his own rockets.  While in high
school, the author became affiliated with CHAOS, and eventually became the
head of Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies.  At this time, at age 18, he produced
his first high explosive device, putting a 1 foot deep crater in an associate's
back yard.  He had also produced many types of rockets, explosive ammunition,
and other pyrotechnic devices.  While he was heading Gunzenbomz Pyro-
Technologies, he was injured when a home made device exploded in his hand; he
did not make the device.  The author learned, however, and  then decided to
reform, and although he still constructs an occasional explosive device, he
chooses to abstain from their production.  An occasional rocket that produces
effects similar to that of professional displays can sometimes be seen in the
midnight sky near his college, and the Fourth of July is still his favorite day
of the year.
