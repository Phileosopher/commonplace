# Cognitive bias and fallacies list - part 1

These are the biases and fallacies that define and distort how we [understand](understanding.md) the world around us.

While cognitive bias and fallacy crafts a [false image](people-image-why.md) relative to [reality](reality.md), most educated people don't often realize that they're very [useful](purpose.md) at making life more [meaningful](meaning.md) or [easier](success-4_routine.md):

- There's *much* less mental work from filtering out information or converting it into a [story](stories-why.md).
- Quick-and-easy solutions lets us sift through *much* more information, even if it's not that thorough.
- By trusting things beyond ourselves, we [get along in society](people-culture.md) more easily.
- By honoring our [fear impulses](mind-feelings-fear.md), we can successfully avoid most bad things that may happen, even if [modern society](jobs-specialization.md) often requires the *opposite* approach.
- We can discover [meaning](meaning.md) and [purpose](purpose.md) from observations to give us something to live for, even when there's nothing there.
- Irrational behavior is often the most [compassionate and loving](people-love.md), which is where the ultimate meaning of life resides.

While avoiding all these aren't necessarily important to live a [good](goodlife.md) and [meaningful](meaning.md) life, we *must* be aware of them to keep our [imaginations and predictions](imagination.md) tethered closely with [reality](reality.md).

It's worth noting that awareness of these biases don't necessarily change anything. We tend to veer into an *opposite* bias while trying to be accurate, and [influencing](power-influence.md) others with incentives to be unbiased doesn't help at all.

This is not a complete list, and probably can never be. It's all based on a "rational actor model", which implies that everyone is [reasonable](understanding.md) until distorted by a bias. The rational actor model is likely wrong.

## Detecting Information
