# Moving checklist

Moving typically requires far more work than you will expect.

- Treat each smaller part of it as its own logistical accomplishment.

We *always* underestimate how many possessions we own and how much time/energy it will take.

## Setting a moving date

You technically have 3 move-out dates:

1. The day you start moving things out
2. The day you rent the truck (if needed)
3. The day all your stuff is out

To prevent more stress, plan your final move-out day at least 1-2 weeks after your first available moving-in day.

[ ] Mark everything in a calendar.

- If other people are affected, make the plan publicly accessible.

## ASAP

[ ] Measure for new furniture and large appliances, then sell what you don't want to move.

[ ] Sell or give away unwanted items.

## 1 month before moving day

[ ] Make a [budget](money-3_budget.md) for your moving expenses:

## 2 weeks before moving day

Start eating perishable food from the freezer and refrigerator.

Start disassembling furniture:

- Take photos of complex wiring arrangements.
- Before pulling out cords, label them.
- Keep pieces separate with a muffin tin or plastic bags.

Pack intentionally:

- Each box should only have items for one room.
- Don't allow extra space in boxes that allows things to rattle around, but don't make it too heavy that it'll be difficult to carry.
- Use smaller boxes for heavier items.
- As much as possible, keep boxes off the floor to save your back.
- Stack the heaviest boxes on the bottom.
- If you still have them available, use the original boxes for electronics.
- Put small, related parts (e.g., off a TV rack) in a labeled paper bag or tape them together.
- To save on padding, use towels, pillows, t-shirts, dish rags, and newspapers.
- Use at least 2" of packing material around fragile items.
- Separate "cherished" items from "common"
- Set extremely fragile items in a box, then set them in a larger box filled with cushioning.
- Use a bathroom scale to keep each box no heavier than 30-50 lbs.
- To avoid ripped boxes, pack the heaviest items (e.g., books) in luggage containers.
- For heavier boxes, reinforce them with cross-wise tape along the box seams.
- Label the two broadest sides opposite each other.

Label the boxes with a numbered system:

- Abbreviate room names on a clipboard or tablet.
- Check off the boxes as you go.
- Take a general inventory with a Room List.
- Mark "Fragile" both on your summary *and* the box.

Donate, throw away, or hold a garage sale for your "Get Rid Of" pile.

[ ] Make arrangements for child and pet sitting.

[ ] Thoroughly clean the entire house.

[ ] Account for any hidden valuables (e.g., fake rocks, behind appliances).

[ ] Make a pile of items you're leaving behind (e.g., spare house keys, garage door openers).

## The day before moving day

[ ] Charge everyone's cell phone.

[ ] Make sure everyone has everyone else's phone number.

[ ] Print out copies of directions for everyone driving to the new home.

[ ] Have everyone pack 1--2 suitcases of necessities:

- [ ] Something to read
- [ ] Three days' worth of clothes
- [ ] Toothbrush and toothpaste (if not in Open First boxes)

## Moving day

Start early.

[ ] Take all the trash out.

If you have dogs, take them out first.

When other people are helping, stay visible and available near the front door.

If you have cats, take them out last.

Do final checks before leaving your old home:

- [ ] Ensure the air conditioning, heater, and fans are off.
- [ ] Verify the water is off.
- [ ] Turn off all light switches.
- [ ] Double-check that you've left nothing behind.
- [ ] Lock all doors and windows.
- [ ] Leave or turn in all keys and garage door openers.

[ ] Unload everything into the house or storage unit:

- Your primary objective is to safely clear the moving vehicles and put everything in a safe place on your property.
- If you have cats, put them in first.
- Direct movers and volunteers to place boxes in their labeled rooms.
- If you have dogs, bring them last.
- Unless everyone has the energy for it, don't bother unpacking yet.

[ ] Treat the volunteers, family, and yourself to dining out to celebrate.

## Unpacking and settling in

Before you unpack, keep at least one trash bag (for trash) and one box (for packing paper and peanuts) in each room.

Plan for unpacking:

1. "Open Me First" boxes
2. Bathroom and kitchen
3. Everything else

Discipline yourself to unpack a certain number of boxes each day.

[ ] Buy new necessities *before* you need them:

- Toilet paper
- Cleaning supplies
- Plungers
- Minor repair parts

[ ] Look at a map of the area and familiarize yourself with routes and locations:

- Your workplace
- Essential shopping locations
- Local entertainment plazas

As you settle in, your disposition will change:

- Your new environment, peers, and lifestyle routine will permanently change your [identity](identity.md).
- As you adapt to the new location, [pay close attention](awareness.md) to whom you associate with and how you think.
- If you've moved to a different country, consider changing your commonly used name to make it easier for the locals to pronounce it.
