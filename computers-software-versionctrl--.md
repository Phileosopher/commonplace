## Git

freeCodeCamp dev quiz - Git/Version Control
- The modified state in Git is when changes have been made to the files but those changes are not saved yet
- In the command line, you can use git init to initialize a new Git repository
- GitHub is a popular hosting platform for developers to store their Git repositories and collaborate with other developers all around the world.
- The staged state is when the files are ready to be committed
- The committed state is when all of the files have been saved to the local repo and are ready to be pushed to the remote repo
- In the command line, you can use git checkout main to switch over to the main branch
- In the command line, you can use git checkout -b new-branch-name to create a new branch and switch to it
- In the command line, you can use git commit -m "commit message" to commit your changes.
- You can use git branch -d to delete a branch from the repository.
- In the command line, you can use git merge to integrate changes from one branch to another
- You can use git log to see the commits in a repository in reverse chronological order.
- You can pull changes from the remote repository with git pull .
- In the command line, you can use git remote add origin git-url to connect the local repository to the remote one.

* Always double check the text of your commit message, before, during, and after pushing it.
* Always double check the diff of your commit, before the commit, and after pushing it, that way you make sure you didn't cause a mess for later.

## Jokes

git pull a day keeps the conflicts away
If you have anything staged, commit now or stash forever
git-hg: Don't you know that's poison?
git stash drop: Hey! That stuff's expensive.
Remember to keep your porcelain clean
git-fetch: no training required
Commit early, commit often. A tip for version controlling - not for relationships
Fork by yourself, shame on you. Fork with a friend, now we're getting somewhere.
A branch, a tag, and a reflog walk into a bar. The bartender says, "What is this, some sort of rebase?"
Why did the commit cross the rebase? To git to the other repo
You can checkout any time you like, but you can never diff.
git-sweep: It's brooms, all the way down.
I kissed a git, and I liked it. I hope my repo don't mind it.
The git that keeps on giving.
git-svn: now you have two problems.
CVS Survivors Meetings are Tuesdays at 9
Beware the HEADless horseman of gitty hollow
Be careful not to step in the git-gui
Ring around the repo, pockets full of plumbing, objects, objects, we all commit.
git-nom --omnom: eats all your tasty code
Gits N' Roses: Now with more git cherry-pop, git freebase, and starring git Slash!
Nurture your git-twigs and they will grow into a full branch
Knock knock. Who's there? Git. Git-who? Sorry, 'who' is not a git command - did you mean 'show'?
We're gits of the round table! | We eat ham and jam and commitalot! | On second thought, let's not go to #gitalot. It is a silly place.
Be careful when rewriting history. It may push you to use the dark side of the --force
When you play the game of clones, you merge or you reset --hard.
git-clone has nothing to do with reproduction. So stop that.
git: Multiplayer Notepad
It's big, it's heavy, it's wood! git-log, from BLAMMO!
Now with more indirect cycling giraffes!
git-prune: not as tasty as git-cherry, but much better for you
git-fsck: think of the children
Keep good care of your git-shell and your inner snail will thank you
git-daemon: the evil rises
