# What malware is

Hackers use a variety of methods, but their [creativity](mind-creativity.md) means they're *always* finding more.

Malware comes in a variety of forms, and they are not mutually exclusive concepts.

## Appearance

"Viruses" masquerade as other programs.

- In fact, many *virus scanners* are actually spyware.

"Trojan horses" or "trojans" masquerade as non-executing documents.

## OS propagation

"Rootkits" infect the core files of the [operating system](computers-os.md).

"Worms" self-replicate and infect other computers. These can be particularly nasty on [computer networks](networks-computer.md).

- The primary difference between a worm and a virus is that a virus needs user interaction.

"Bots" are hidden software that won't activate until later. They're often easy to install quietly onto computers that people don't use often (such as a smart fridge).

## Tracking

"Spyware" tracks what someone is doing.

- It could include a "keylogger" that tracks what someone types or clicks, capture screenshots, or monitor where someone is using their network.
- The point of spyware is to stay hidden, so it's only detectable with a virus scan.
- However, most people *do* consent to spyware by legal tech companies, which don't openly extort people but still [violate their rights](faang.md).

## Modification

"Adware" bloats a computer with ads. These are often *extremely* obvious because your computer has many ads you never expected to see.

"Ransomware" is meant to scare the user into paying an extortion fee, which can often be through [cryptocurrency](computers-blockchain.md) to hide the paper trail. Most ransomware attacks will repeat themselves after the ransom was paid.

## Combined

Naturally, like with any other [programmming](computers-programming-basics.md), the quality of the program is based on the quality of its code, and therefore based on the logical talent of the programmer.

Malware often has multiple purposes. For example, a brilliant hacker could create an adware worm packaged as a virus that sends trojan rootkits that serve as spyware, which is also a bot that activates ransomware at the hacker's command.

An RAT (remote-access trojan) is when a hacker sends a trojan masquerading as a software update or stream of data (such as video or music).

## Timing

Not all malware executes immediately.

The software may send information routinely over a network, or may wait until a certain specified time or triggered command.

Also, the software may be fire-and-forget to activate at a certain time, or could be a "remote access tool" (RAT) that can remotely activate software or control a computer over a network.
