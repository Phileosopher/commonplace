- Find a college student pursuing teaching or nursing that needs work experience with children.
- Look into employer-provided childcare.

- Some gyms and theaters give free childcare while you're at the facility.

## Creating connections

Find friends who share your values about money.

Create a mastermind group to achieve your goals together.

Invite others into your low-expense lifestyle with local community events or holiday festivals.

Host affordable events with family and friends:

- Make a movie, board game or card game night.
- Visit a bookstore and read or share experiences with each other.
- Start a neighborhood block party.
- Have video game nights.
- Hold Scrabble competitions.
- Have LEGO nights with children.

When your friends or family make much more or less than you, search for activities you can both do.

- If you make less than them, boldly let them know you would rather not do something because it interferes with your financial goals.
- Try to avoid borrowing money, but if you must borrow, establish a concrete deadline and draw up a contract with an interest rate.
- If you make more than them, keep your thoughts to yourself and only loan money when you expect to lose it.

If you ever loan something to a friend and want to be certain you get it back, take a photo of them with the item when you give it to them
