# List of universal laws and axioms regarding science

Archimedes' Principle / Avogadro's Law - Physical things, all things being equal, take up the same space.

Bernoulli's Principle - Except for viscosity, a fluid's kinetic energy, internal energy, and potential energy remain the same. The most practical application is that that more kinetic energy (i.e., going faster) means the internal energy and potential energy (e.g., static pressure)

Clarke's Second Law - Knowing how far things are possible requires venturing a little into the impossible.

Newton's Law of Cooling - Things change proportionally the difference between the two things.

De Morgan's Laws - When at least one of two things aren't, they aren't when put together. When both of something isn't, one of them certainly isn't.

Emmert's Law - Things that are the same size appear to be different sizes when they're at different distances.

Faraday's Law of Electrolysis - The new mass made on an electrode is proportional to the electric current run through it.

Faraday's Law of Induction - A changing magnetic field creates a proportional amount of electricity.

Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection - Living things adapt proportionally to their environment based on the variety of what they have.

Grassman's Law/Abney's Law - Each visible color is a precise combination of various colors.

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle - Many things operate in pairs, where measuring one of them makes another measurement impossible.

Hess' Law - Chemical reactions create the same results, no matter how many steps you take.

Kirchhoff's Three Laws of Spectroscopy - If a solid, liquid, and gas emit light, it'll cover the entire light spectrum. A gas will only emit certain light wave frequencies, and will absorb certain light wave frequencies.

Kopp's Law - Physically, the whole is *precisely* the sum of its parts.

Mendel's Second Law - New things are always a remix of old things.

Newton's First Law of Motion - Things stay the same or keep moving until something else affects them.

Newton's Third Law of Motion - If something exerts a force on something else, that thing in turn responds with the same amount of opposite force.

Oddo-Harkins Rule - Elements with an even atomic number are more common than with an odd one.

Ohm's Acoustic Law - People perceive in harmonized blocks, not with individual data.

Square-Cube Law - When something scales proportionally in surface area, it scales exponentially in volume.

Third Law of Thermodynamics - Chaos is easier to predict as activity ceases.

Venturi Effect - When an incompressible fluid travels through a constricted area, its velocity increases and its pressure decreases (from Bernoulli's Principle)

Wiedemann-Franz Law - The heat and electricity through a metal is proportional to its temperature.

Wolff's Law - Structures adapt to pressure, or lack of it.
