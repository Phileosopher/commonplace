"Business" comes from the root word "busy", and represents everything normally necessary to [make money](https://adequate.life/jobs-1/) that doesn't use a [specialized](https://gainedin.site/specialization-cities/), [in-demand](https://gainedin.site/economics/) skill.

- Someone's business may be [poultry farming](/livestock/) or [custodial work](https://adequate.life/housekeeping/), but they still must do the same of some things as [distributed hosting providers](http://trendless.tech/dist-sys/) or [drivers](/autos/).
- Often, their business can *be* one of those things that everyone needs.

Every person who [freelances](/entrepreneur-freelancing/), even slightly, is engaging in business skills, to some degree.

- However, many of those domains are an entire discipline of their own.
- In the course of their work, an [**entrepreneur**](/entrepreneur/) will perform *all* the skills in some capacity, and eventually must delegate [if they scale](/entrepreneur-scaling/).

While the only constant in business is [change](https://gainedin.site/change/), the abstractions express the same way.

## Core components

**[Marketing](/marketing/)** is conveying value, which applies [influence](https://gainedin.site/influence/) to make people [psychologically bias](https://gainedin.site/bias/) to want your product (which also frequently requires **sales**).

**[Accounting](/accounting/)** is [keeping track](https://gainedin.site/math/) of value, starting with assets and liabilities and inferring financial value from it (typically for **taxes**).

**[Legal](/legally-safe/)** resolves civil disputes and tracks whether activities comply with a region's [rules](https://gainedin.site/rules/).

## Eventual needs

**[Information Technology (IT)](http://trendless.tech)** keeps the computers running, which is inevitable if the business ever requires any degree of automation.

**[Management](/mgmt/)** is directing people to do things and manage projects, which comes once an [organization](https://gainedin.site/groups-small/) surpasses about 3-4 people, even if they're [volunteers](/mgmt-npo/).

**[Logistics](/logistics/)** must have drivers and dispatchers.

## Larger-scale needs

**Human Resources (HR)** manages a wide variety of miscellaneous tasks loosely connected to [risk management](/risk-mgmt/) and employee retention, since they can become time-intensive once an organization grows larger:

- Data entry and submission for [payroll](/accounting/).
- Manage distributions to [retirement plans](/investing/).
- Resolving employee [disputes](https://adequate.life/conflicts/).
- Running background checks for possible hires.
- Managing the processes for new hires (onboarding) and terminations (offboarding), including ergonomic/ADA issues.
- Serving as a loss control manager to prevent and manage [insurance claims](/insurance/) (especially regarding workers' comp insurance).
- Archiving employee records and performance reviews.
- Managing organization-wide activities.
- Managing various other employee benefits (paid time off, company [vehicles](/autos/), etc.).
- Conducting periodic audits about the [balance of power](https://gainedin.site/power-types/) and [responsibilities](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) in an organization.

**Public Relations (PR)** directly manages the public [reputation](https://gainedin.site/image/) of the organization, and serves to [conform the organization's appearance](https://gainedin.site/image-distortion/) to offset scandalous events.
